Likelihood of going blind
The good news is that if you are not blind at this time, there is a very good chance that you will never be blind, at least from glaucoma. It is true that glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world after cataract. And, it presents a real threat to the vision of anyone who develops it.
