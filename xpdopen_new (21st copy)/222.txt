Chances of dying of natural causes
When people kill themselves, are killed by someone else or die as the result of an accident, that's considered non-natural. Any other cause is “natural.” According to the latest CDC data, 2,596,993 people died in the U.S. in 2013. The vast majority of those deaths, 92.5 percent, were of natural causes.Aug 13, 2015
