Chances of getting pregnant on period
The likelihood of getting pregnant right before your period is extremely low. For women who have a typical cycle of 28 to 30 days or longer and their cycles are regular, it is fairly safe to say that your ovulation occurred between Day 11 and Day 21. The egg is only available for 12 to 24 hours for conception.Sep 2, 2016
