What are the chances of having a second miscarriage?
Miscarriage is usually a one-time occurrence. Most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies after miscarriage. A small number of women — 1 percent — will have two or more miscarriages. The predicted risk of miscarriage in a future pregnancy remains about 14 percent after one miscarriage.
