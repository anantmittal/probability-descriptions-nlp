The field bet is another one of the most common and popular craps bets. It also has fairly good odds as well so players could benefit from this bet. Basically, all you are betting on is that the shooter will roll a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 or 12. The player wins the bet if the dice lands on any of these numbers.
