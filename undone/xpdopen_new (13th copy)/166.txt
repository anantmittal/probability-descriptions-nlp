Chances of becoming a millionaire
An Asian person younger than 40 years old has a 2.4 percent chance of being a millionaire, odds that soar to 21 percent by the time he's nearing or in retirement. For Hispanics, those chances barely budge: from less than 1 percent when they're young to 2.3 percent when they're 62 or older.Jan 21, 2016
