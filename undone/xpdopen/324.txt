Most parents with epilepsy do not have children with epilepsy, and the chances of inheriting epilepsy are generally low. The risk for any child to develop epilepsy by the age of 20 is around 1% (1 in 100), and the risk may increase to around 2 to 5 in 100 (2 -5%) for most children of parents with epilepsy.
