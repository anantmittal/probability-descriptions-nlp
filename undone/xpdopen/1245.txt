The older you are, the more likely you are to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although only 1 in 403 under age 50 will be diagnosed, the rate shoots up to 1 in 58 for ages 50 to 59, and 1 in 21 for ages 60 to 69. In fact, nearly 60% of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over the age of 65.
