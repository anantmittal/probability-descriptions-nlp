Snake Eyes -- from Wolfram MathWorld
mathworld.wolfram.com/SnakeEyes.htmlTo calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.

www.stayorswitch.com/blog/with-two-dice-whats-the-probability-of-rolling-doubles/For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

Usually a one-tailed test of hypothesis is is used when one talks about type I error.

www.cs.uni.edu/~campbell/stat/inf5.htmlWhat is the probability of flipping a coin?
Probability. Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are equally probable. But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of any other result.
Introduction to Probability and Statistics - Fourmilab
https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/statistics.html
Search for: What is the probability of flipping a coin?Definition: Two events, A and B, are independent if the fact that A occurs does not affect the probability of B occurring. Some other examples of independent events are: Landing on heads after tossing a coin AND rolling a 5 on a single 6-sided die. Choosing a marble from a jar AND landing on heads after tossing a coin.
Independent Events | Math Goodies
https://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/vol6/independent_eventsType I Error – rejecting the null when it is true. Type II Error – failing to reject the null when it is false. The probability of a Type I Error in hypothesis testing is predetermined by the significance level. The power of a hypothesis test is nothing more than 1 minus the probability of a Type II error.

Use the specific multiplication rule formula. Just multiply the probability of the first event by the second. For example, if the probability of event A is 2/9 and the probability of event B is 3/9 then the probability of both events happening at the same time is (2/9)*(3/9) = 6/81 = 2/27.Sep 14, 2009
