Find probability given mean and standard deviation
The value of 20 has a Z score of 0, which means it is equal to the mean. And the value of 30 has a Z score of 1, which means it is one standard deviation above the mean. The Z score allows you to calculate the probability that a normally distributed random variable x will fall within a desired range.
