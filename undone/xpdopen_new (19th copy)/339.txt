Probability of normal distribution
As is the case with all continuous distributions, finding the probability involves finding the area under the curve and to the left of the line x = 90: That is: There's just one problem... ... So, all we need to do is find a normal probability table for a normal distribution with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 16.
