Fertility while Breastfeeding
Yes. In general, you're less fertile, but not infertile, while breastfeeding. ... This is because breastfeeding curbs the hormones that trigger ovulation. Although your period may not return for months after giving birth, your body usually releases its first postnatal egg before you get your first period.
