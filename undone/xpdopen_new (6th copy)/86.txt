Chances of getting pregnant during ovulation
Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman's next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14. If sex is timed five days before a woman's ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%.
