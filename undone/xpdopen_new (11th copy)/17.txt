Flush draw odds
As you can see in the above table, if you're holding a flush draw after the flop (9 outs) you have a 19.1% chance of hitting it on the turn or expressed in odds, you're 4.22-to-1 against. The odds are slightly better from the turn to the river, and much better when you have both cards still to come.
