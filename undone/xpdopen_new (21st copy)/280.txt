Fingering on its own can't lead to pregnancy. But it is possible to get pregnant if a guy gets pre-ejaculate (precum) or ejaculate on his finger and then puts it in a girl's vagina. The chances of this happening are low, though. A more likely situation than pregnancy is getting an infection from fingering.
