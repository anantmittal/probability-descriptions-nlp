What are the chances of getting pregnant 2 days after your period?
So it may just be possible for you to get pregnant if you ovulate a little earlier than usual. However, it is more likely that sperm will have a life span of two to three days, even less if there is no fertile cervical fluid. Most pregnancies happen after sex within the five days before, and on the day of, ovulation.
