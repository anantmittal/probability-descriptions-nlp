Chances of pregnancy during ovulation
If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman's next expected period. ... If sex is timed five days before a woman's ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%.
