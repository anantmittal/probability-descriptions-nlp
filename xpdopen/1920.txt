Probability of color blindness
The son of a woman carrying a faulty gene has a 50% chance of inheriting the faulty X chromosome and as a result – suffering from color blindness. The daughter of the same woman is unlikely to be color blind unless her father is color blind; however she retains a 50% chance of being a carrier for the defective gene.
