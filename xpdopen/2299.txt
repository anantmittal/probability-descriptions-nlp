Pregnancy Chances
It should be kept in mind that the average couple tries for 6 months to conceive, and it's estimated that in a healthy couple under the age of 35 there is only a 25 percent chance of pregnancy with a single sexual act during a fertile time. Sex mid-cycle does not guarantee pregnancy, it just poses the highest chance.
