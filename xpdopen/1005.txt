Age: Ninety percent of SIDS cases happen before six months of age, with a peak incidence between one and four months of age. So the older your baby, the less the chance of SIDS. Birth weight: Babies born at a low birth weight or those born after intra-uterine growth restriction are more likely to die of SIDS.
