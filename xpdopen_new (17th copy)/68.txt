Six weeks pregnant risk of miscarriage
Miscarriage affects one in every four women. The highest risk period is between 4 and 6 weeks. Once 8 or 9 weeks are reached and the baby's heart beat is seen on a scan there is only a 4% to 5% chance of miscarriage, depending on the speed of the heart-beat.Oct 5, 2017
