Inheritance. Fragile X in an “X-linked” condition, which means that the gene is on the X chromosome. Since a woman has two X chromosomes a woman with a premutation or full mutation has a 50% chance of passing on the X with the mutation in each pregnancy, and a 50% chance of passing on her normal X.
