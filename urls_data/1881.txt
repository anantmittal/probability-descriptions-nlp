The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation. For the standard normal distribution, 68% of the observations lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% lie within two standard deviation of the mean; and 99.9% lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. To this point, we have been using "X" to denote the variable of interest (e.g., X=BMI, X=height, X=weight). However, when using a standard normal distribution, we will use "Z" to refer to a variable in the context of a standard normal distribution. After standarization, the BMI=30 discussed on the previous page is shown below lying 0.16667 units above the mean of 0 on the standard normal distribution on the right.     ====  Since the area under the standard curve = 1, we can begin to more precisely define the probabilities of specific observation. For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution.¬†Examine the table and note that a "Z" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a "Z" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%. So, the 50% below the mean plus the 34% above the mean gives us 84%.  Probabilities of the Standard Normal Distribution Z         This table is organized to provide the area under the curve to the left of or less of a specified value or "Z value". In this case, because the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1, the Z value is the number of standard deviation units away from the mean, and the area is the probability of observing a value less than that particular Z value. Note also that the table shows probabilities to two decimal places of Z. The units place and the first decimal place are shown in the left hand column, and the second decimal place is displayed across the top row.  But let's get back to the question about the probability that the BMI is less than 30, i.e., P(X<30). We can answer this question using the standard normal distribution. The figures below show the distributions of BMI for men aged 60 and the standard normal distribution side-by-side.  Distribution of BMI and Standard Normal Distribution   ====  The area under each curve is one but the scaling of the X axis is different. Note, however, that the areas to the left of the dashed line are the same. The BMI distribution ranges from 11 to 47, while the standardized normal distribution, Z, ranges from -3 to 3. We want to compute P(X < 30). To do this we can determine the Z value that corresponds to X = 30 and then use the standard normal distribution table above to find the probability or area under the curve. The following formula converts an X value into a Z score , also called a standardized score :   where Œº is the mean and œÉ is the standard deviation of the variable X.  In order to compute P(X < 30) we convert the X=30 to its corresponding Z score (this is called standardizing ):   Thus, P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17). We can then look up the corresponding probability for this Z score from the standard normal distribution table, which shows that P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17) = 0.5675. Thus, the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI less than 30 is 56.75%.  Another Example  Using the same distribution for BMI, what is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI exceeding 35? In other words, what is P(X > 35)? Again we standardize:   We now go to the standard normal distribution table to look up P(Z>1) and for Z=1.00 we find that P(Z<1.00) = 0.8413. Note, however, that the table always gives the probability that Z is less than the specified value, i.e., it gives us P(Z<1)=0.8413.   Therefore, P(Z>1)=1-0.8413=0.1587. Interpretation: Almost 16% of men aged 60 have BMI over 35.  Normal Probability Calculator         Z-Scores with R  As an alternative to looking up normal probabilities in the table or using Excel, we can use R to compute probabilities. For example,  > pnorm(0)  [1] 0.5  A Z-score of 0 (the mean of any distribution) has 50% of the area to the left. What is the probability that a 60 year old man in the population above has a BMI less than 29 (the mean)? The Z-score would be 0, and pnorm(0)=0.5 or 50%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI less than 30? The Z-score was 0.16667.  > pnorm(0.16667)  [1] 0.5661851  So, the probabilty is 56.6%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI greater than 35?  35-29=6, which is one standard deviation above the mean. So we can compute the area to the left  > pnorm(1)  [1] 0.8413447  and then subtract the result from 1.0.  1-0.8413447= 0.1586553  So the probability of a 60 year ld man having a BMI greater than 35 is 15.8%.  Or, we can use R to compute the entire thing in a single step as follows:  > 1-pnorm(1)  [1] 0.1586553    Probability for a Range of Values   What is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI between 30 and 35? Note that this is the same as asking what proportion of men aged 60 have BMI between 30 and 35. Specifically, we want P(30 < X < 35)? We previously computed P(30<X) and P(X<35); how can these two results be used to compute the probability that BMI will be between 30 and 35? Try to formulate and answer on your own before looking at the explanation below.  Answer     Now consider BMI in women. What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI less than 30? We use the same approach, but for women aged 60 the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 7.  Answer     What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI exceeding 40? Specifically, what is P(X > 40)?  Answer     return to top | previous page | next page     Content ¬©2016. All Rights Reserved. Date last modified: July 24, 2016. Wayne W. LaMorte, MD, PhD, MPH Boston University School of Public Health            z score Calculator    The probability of a result x in an experiment consisting of a
large number of equally probable independent trials n is
approximated by the normal probability density function :     where Œº, the mean value , is n /2 and
œÉ,
the standard deviation , is a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for experiments with two equally probable outcomes
of each trial is:     Since the mean value and standard deviation depend upon the number
of trials in the experiment, comparison between experiments
with differing numbers of trials is facilitated by standardising the result: transforming it
to a distribution with mean value zero and standard deviation
of 1.  A normally distributed experimental result x is thus standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing
by the standard deviation of the experiment:     This z-value or z score expresses the
divergence of the experimental result x from the
most probable result Œº as a number of standard
deviations œÉ
The larger the value of z , the less probable the
experimental result is due to chance.  The probability
can be calculated from the cumulative standard
normal distribution :     Which gives the probability P that an experimental
result with a z value less than or equal to that
observed is due to chance.  Subtracting P from one:     gives Q , the probability that the observed z score is due to chance.  Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for P , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  This page allows you to calculate the
probability of chance occurrence of a given z , or to
calculate z given a probability Q .  All
calculations are performed with six decimal places of accuracy; the
maximum z accepted is 6.  Note that the probability calculated from the z is an approximation which is valid only for large
values of n , and is therefore only meaningful when
calculated for experiments with a large number of
individual trials.   In order to use this page, your browser must support JavaScript.

the measured z value from an experiment or set of
experiments, the probability of the result being due to chance.  Enter
the z value in the box below, press the Return key or
the Calculate button, and the probability will appear in the Q
box.   Given z =    The chance probability, Q , is: or about one in      Calculate z from probability Q  To determine the z score indicating a probability Q of non-chance occurrence for an experiment,
enter Q in the box below and
press the Return key or the Calculate button.

The standard score does this by converting (in other words, standardizing) scores in a normal distribution to z-scores in what becomes a standard normal distribution. To explain what this means in simple terms, let's use an example (if needed, see our statistical guide, Normal Distribution Calculations , for background information on normal distribution calculations).  Setting the scene: Part 1  A tutor sets a piece of English Literature coursework for the 50 students in his class. We make the assumption that when the scores are presented on a histogram, the data is found to be normally distributed. The mean score is 60 out of 100 and the standard deviation (in other words, the variation in the scores) is 15 marks (see our statistical guides, Measures of Central Tendency and Standard Deviation , for more information about the mean and standard deviation).  Having looked at the performance of the tutor's class, one student, Sarah, has asked the tutor if, by scoring 70 out of 100, she has done well. Bearing in mind that the mean score was 60 out of 100 and that Sarah scored 70, then at first sight it may appear that since Sarah has scored 10 marks above the 'average' mark, she has achieved one of the best marks. However, this does not take into consideration the variation in scores amongst the 50 students (in other words, the standard deviation). After all, if the standard deviation is 15, then there is a reasonable amount of variation amongst the scores when compared with the mean.  Whilst Sarah has still scored much higher than the mean score, she has not necessarily achieved one of the best marks in her class. The question arises: How well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students? Before answering this question, let us look at another problem.      Join the 10,000s of students, academics and professionals who rely on Laerd Statistics.   TAKE THE TOUR  PLANS & PRICING      The tutor has a dilemma. In the next academic year, he must choose which of his students have performed well enough to be entered into an advanced English Literature class. He decides to use the coursework scores as an indicator of the performance of his students. As such, he feels that only those students that are in the top 10% of the class should be entered into the advanced English Literature class. The question arises: Which students came in the top 10% of the class?  Therefore, we are left with two questions to answer. First, how well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students? Second, which students came in the top 10% of the class?  Whilst it is possible to calculate the answer to both of these questions using the existing mean score and standard deviation, this is very complex. Therefore, statisticians have come up with probability distributions , which are ways of calculating the probability of a score occurring for a number of common distributions, such as the normal distribution. In our case, we make the assumption that the students' scores are normally distributed. As such, we can use something called the standard normal distribution and its related z-scores to answer these questions much more easily.  Standard Normal Distribution and Standard Score (z-score)  When a frequency distribution is normally distributed, we can find out the probability of a score occurring by standardising the scores, known as standard scores (or z scores). The standard normal distribution simply converts the group of data in our frequency distribution such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 (see below).       1  2  3  4    next ¬ª     Home  About Us  Contact Us  Terms & Conditions  Privacy & Cookies ¬© 2013 Lund Research Ltd               Search       Statistics How To   Statistics for the rest of us!

How to Find a Z-Score in Excel.  How to find a critical z-value on the TI-83.    1. What is a Z-Score?  Simply put, a z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean a data point is. But more technically it‚Äôs a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. A z-score is also known as a standard score and it can be placed on a normal distribution curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). In order to use a z-score, you need to know the mean Œº and also the population standard deviation œÉ.  Z-scores are a way to compare results from a test to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù population. Results from tests or surveys have thousands of possible results and units. However, those results can often seem meaningless. For example, knowing that someone‚Äôs weight is 150 pounds might be good information, but if you want to compare it to the ‚Äú average ‚Äù person‚Äôs weight, looking at a vast table of data can be overwhelming (especially if some weights are recorded in kilograms). A z-score can tell you where that person‚Äôs weight is compared to the average population‚Äôs mean weight.   Back to Top  2. Z Score Formulas  The Z Score Formula: One Sample  The basic z score formula for a sample is:  z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / œÉ For example, let‚Äôs say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (Œº) of 150 and a standard deviation (œÉ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution , your z score would be: z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / œÉ = 190 ‚Äì 150 / 25 = 1.6. The z score tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your score is. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.  You may also see the z score formula shown to the left. This is exactly the same formula as z = x ‚Äì Œº / œÉ, except that xÃÑ (the sample mean ) is used instead of Œº (the population mean) and s (the sample standard deviation ) is used instead of œÉ (the population standard deviation). However, the steps for solving it are exactly the same.   Z Score Formula: Standard Error of the Mean  When you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those sample means ( the standard error ), you would use this z score formula:  z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / (œÉ / ‚àön) This z-score will tell you how many standard errors there are between the sample mean and the population mean.  Sample problem: In general, the mean height of women is 65‚Ä≥ with a standard deviation of 3.5‚Ä≥. What is the probability of finding a random sample of 50 women with a mean height of 70‚Ä≥, assuming the heights are normally distributed?  z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / (œÉ / ‚àön) = (70 ‚Äì 65) / (3.5/‚àö50) = 5 / 0.495 = 10.1  The key here is that we‚Äôre dealing with a sampling distribution of means, so we know we have to include the standard error in the formula. We also know that 99% of values fall within 3 standard deviations from the mean in a normal probability distribution (see 68 95 99.7 rule ). Therefore, there‚Äôs less than 1% probability that any sample of women will have a mean height of 70‚Ä≥.  Confused about when to use œÉ and when to use œÉ ‚àön? See: Sigma / sqrt (n) ‚Äî why is it used?  Back to Top  3. How to Calculate a Z-Score  You can easily calculate a z-score on a TI-83 calculator or in Excel . However, if you don‚Äôt have either, you can calculate it by hand.   Sample question: You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?  Step 1: Write your X-value into the z-score equation . For this sample question the X-value is your SAT score, 1100.   Step 2: Put the mean, Œº, into the z-score equation .   Step 3: Write the standard deviation, œÉ into the z-score equation .   Step 4: Calculate the answer using a calculator : (1100 ‚Äì 1026) / 209 = .354. This means that your score was .354 std devs above the mean.  Step 5: ( Optional ) Look up your z-value in the z-table to see what percentage of test-takers scored below you. A z-score of .354 is .1368 + .5000* =  .6368 or 63.68%.  *Why add .500 to the result? The z-table shown has scores for the RIGHT of the mean. Therefore, we have to add .500 for all of the area LEFT of the mean. For more examples of when to add (or subtract) .500, see several examples in: Area under a normal distribution curve .  Like the explanation? Check out the Practically Cheating Statistics Handbook , which has hundreds more step-by-step explanations, just like this one!  Back to Top  4. Z scores and Standard Deviations  Technically, a z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean value of the reference population (a population whose known values have been recorded, like in these charts the CDC compiles about people‚Äôs weights). For example:   A z-score of 1 is 1 standard deviation above the mean .  A score of 2 is 2 standard deviations above the mean .  A score of -1.8 is -1.8 standard deviations  below the mean .   A z-score tells you where the score lies on a normal distribution curve. A z-score of zero tells you the values is exactly average while a score of +3 tells you that the value is much higher than average.  Back to Top  5. How is it Used in Real Life?  You can use the z-table and the normal distribution graph to give you a visual about how a z-score of 2.0 means ‚Äúhigher than average‚Äù. Let‚Äôs say you have a person‚Äôs weight (240 pounds), and you know their z-score is 2.0. You know that 2.0 is above average (because of the high placement on the normal distribution curve), but you want to know how much above average is this weight?   The z-score in the center of the curve is zero. The z-scores to the right of the mean are positive and the z-scores to the left of the mean are negative . If you look up the score in the z-table , you can tell what percentage of the population is above or below your score. The table below shows a z-score of 2.0 highlighted, showing .9772 (which converts to 97.72%). If you look at the same score (2.0) of the normal distribution curve above, you‚Äôll see it corresponds with 97.72%.  That tells you 97.72% of the population‚Äôs scores lie below that particular score and 100% ‚Äì 97.72% = 2.28% of the scores lie above that score. A mere 2.28 of the population is above this person‚Äôs weight‚Ä¶.probably a good indication they need to go on a diet!  Technology  1. How to Find a Z-Score on the TI-89  The TI-89 Titanium‚Äôs Stats/List Editor contains a simple menu where you can look up a Z Score in seconds. This section shows you how to find the z-score for a critical value in a left tail. The normal distribution curve is symmetrical, so this will also be the area in a right tail as well.  Not sure if your test is a left tailed or right tailed? See ‚Äú Left Tailed Test or Right Tailed ‚Äù to help you decide.  Note that you must have the Stats/List Editor installed to be able to make a TI-89 frequency distribution using these instructions.  Z Score TI 89: Steps  Watch the video or read the steps below:   Sample problem : find the z score for Œ± = .012 for a left-tailed test on a standard normal distribution curve.  Step 1: Press Apps , scroll to the Stats/List Editor , and press ENTER. If you don‚Äôt see the Stats/List Editor, you can download it here . It‚Äôs an official TI app and you‚Äôll need to transfer it to your calculator using the cable that originally came with your TI-89.  Step 2: Press F5 2 1, to get to the Inverse Normal screen.  Step 3: Enter .012 in the Area box.  Step 4: Enter 0 for the mean , Œº and 1 for the standard deviation , œÉ.  Step 5: Press ENTER.  Step 6: Read the result: the calculator should state ‚Äú Inverse = -2.25713 ‚Äú. This is your z score.  Tip : If you are given a mean and standard deviation , enter them in place of 0 and 1 in Step 4.  That‚Äôs how to find a z score TI 89!  2. How to Find a Z-Score in Excel  Z-Score in Excel: Overview  A z-score tells you how many standard deviations a certain piece of data (‚ÄúX‚Äù) is above or below the mean. A z-score in Excel can quickly be calculated using a basic formula. The formula for calculating a z-score is z=(x-Œº)/œÉ, where Œº is the population mean and œÉ is the population standard deviation (note: if you don‚Äôt know the population standard deviation or the sample size is below 6, you should use a t-score instead of a z-score). In other words, the formula is z = (data point ‚Äì mean) / standard deviation.  Z-Score in Excel: Steps  Watch the video or read the steps below:   Sample question: You take the GRE and scored 650 in the verbal section of the test. Calculate a z-score in Excel to determine how good your score is compared to the general population of test takers. The population mean (Œº) is 469 and the population standard deviation (œÉ) is 119.  Step 1: Type the population mean into a blank cell. For this example, type ‚Äú469‚Äù into cell A2. Optional: type the word ‚Äú mean ‚Äù as a column header in cell A1 so you remember what the value in cell A2 stands for. Step 2: Enter the population standard deviation into a blank cell . For this example, type ‚Äú119‚Äù into cell B2. Optional: type the words ‚Äústandard deviation‚Äù as a column header in cell B1 so you remember what the value in cell B2 stands for. Step 3: Type the X-value (in this sample problem, X is your GRE score) into a blank cell. For this example, type ‚Äú650‚Äù into cell C2. Optional: type the words ‚ÄúX‚Äù as a column header in cell B1 so you remember what the value in cell B2 stands for. Step 4: Enter the following formula into an empty cell: =(C2-A2)/B2 Step 5: Press ‚ÄúEnter.‚Äù The z-score will appear in cell D2: The z-score of 1.521008 in this sample problem indicates your GRE score was 1.521008. That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve found a z-score in Excel. Tip: Once you‚Äôve entered the formula once, you can use it over and over again. Just type a new mean, standard deviation and X value into the relevant boxes. Reference: CDC.

like to calculate the probability of its value occurring in the
interval of the mean plus or minus .5 standard deviations. How would
you go about calculating the probability?  One method is to standardize the random variable. Standardization
of a normally distributed random variable enables an analyst or
researcher to determine with ease the probability associated with a
range of values for that variable by using a standardized
distribution table. A normally distributed random variable can be
standardized using a formula. The letter Z represents the
standardized random variable and the probabilities associated with
ranges of values of Z can be found in a Z distribution table. Read on to learn more about how to calcultate (and
apply) the standardized normally distributed random variable Z .  Standard Normal Distribution The standardized value of a normally distributed random variable
is called a Z score and is calculated using the following
formula.   x = the value that is being standardized  m = the mean of the distribution  s = standard deviation of the
distribution  As the formula shows, a random variable is standardized by
subtracting the mean of the distribution from the value being
standardized, and then dividing this difference by the standard
deviation of the distribution. Once standardized, a normally
distributed random variable has a mean of zero and a standard deviation
of one. The standard normal distribution ( Z distribution) is
shown in the graph below. As you can see from the notation to the
right of the curve, m z = 0 and s z = 1.       Learn How to Calculate the Mean of
a Standard Normal Distribution   To see how a random variable is standardized, imagine you have a
random variable, x , that is normally distributed with a mean
of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. What would be the standardized
value ( Z score) of 40? To solve this problem, you would use
the Z score formula. Using the information from the example,
you know that  x = 40  m = 20  s = 10  Substitute these numbers into the formula and solve.   In this example, the standardized value ( Z score) of 40
is 2.  These Z scores are important because they tell you how far a
value is from the mean. When you standardize a random variable, its
mean becomes zero and its standard deviation becomes one; therefore,  if the Z score of x is zero, then the value of x is equal to the mean.  if the Z score of x is one, then the value of x is one standard deviation above the mean. If the Z score is ‚Äì1, then the value of x is one standard
deviation below the mean.  If the Z score of x is two, then the value of x is two standard deviations above the mean. If the Z score is ‚Äì2, then the value of x is two standard
deviations below the mean.  In the earlier example, the Z score of 40 was 2. This
tells you that 40 is 2 standard deviations above the mean. Consider
three other values from the same distribution and their Z scores, shown in the table below.   As the table shows, the value of 10 has a Z score of ‚Äì1,
which means it is one standard deviation below the mean. The value of
20 has a Z score of 0, which means it is equal to the mean.
And the value of 30 has a Z score of 1, which means it is
one standard deviation above the mean.  Calculating Probability Within a Desired Range The Z score allows you to calculate the probability that
a normally distributed random variable x will fall within a
desired range. As an example, consider an apparel company that
produces garments in China and then ships them to the United States
for and sale.  Let the random variable x be the time required to
transport the product from the manufacturing facility in China to the
United States. Suppose that x is normally distributed with a
mean of 24 days and a standard deviation of 3 days. What is the
probability that a shipment will arrive within 30 days‚ÄîP( x less than or equal to 30)?  To determine the probability, you must first calculate the Z score. With the information from the example, you know
that  x = 30  m = 24  s = 3  Substitute this information into the Z score formula,
and standardize the value of 30, as shown below.     Learn How to Calculate the
Standard Deviation of a Standard Normal Distribution   The next step in determining the probability that the shipment
will arrive within 30 days is to use a Z distribution table.
This table will tell you the probability associated with a given Z score.    Z Distribution Table   The Z distribution is a normal distribution that looks
much like the graph below. The figures in the table show the
probability that a random variable x will fall within the
range to the left of the Z score (from negative infinity up
to the Z score.) Consider the diagram below for a more
intuitive understanding of this concept. If you looked up a Z score of two in a Z distribution table, you would
find that the probability listed in the table represents the pink
shaded area under the curve in the illustration. If you are
interested in the probability of the clear area under the curve‚ÄîP( Z >
2)‚Äîyou would have to subtract the probability
found in the table from one to determine the probability of Z greater than two.   As you might expect, a Z score of zero, when looked up
in the table, yields a probability of .5. This makes sense if you
remember the definition of a normal distribution having half of its
values distributed on either side of the mean.  Returning to the example of apparel shipments, you can look up
the Z score of 2.00 in the table to find the probability that the
shipment will arrive within 30 days. The probability can be found by
looking first down the left-hand column of the table for the number
2.0. Since the number after the decimal point is zero, use the first
column titled .00 for the probability. The probability that Z will be less than or equal to 2.0 is .9772. (This number
is highlighted in this Z table .) This
means that the probability that the shipment will arrive within 30
days is .9772.  With any normally distributed random variable, you can find the
probability of the variable x falling between two values: calculate the Z score of each value, look up their
probabilities in a Z distribution table, and then
subtract the smaller probability from the larger one. The difference
is the probability of the random variable x falling between
the two values.  For a demonstration of finding the probability of an interval of
values, consider again the apparel manufacturer example from above.
Calculate the probability of an apparel shipment arriving within the
range of 22 to 26 days, using above data for m x and s x of 24 days and 3 days,
respectively.  To solve this problem, first standardize the
variables at each end of the interval in question. Calculate the Z value using the following formula for Z .   First, for the lower end of the interval of 22 days, calculate the Z value.   Then, for the upper end of the interval of 26 days, calculate the Z value.   Now look up the probability of each standardized random variable Z in a Z distribution table. The probability
associated with the standardized random variable ‚Äì.67 is .2514 (a
value which is determined by calculating 1 ‚Äì .7486). The probability
associated with the standardized random variable .67 is .7486.  To find the probability of an interval, subtract the lower end of
the interval from the upper end of the interval.   The probability of an apparel shipment arriving in 22 to 26 days
is .4972.   1. What is the assumed distribution behind a standardized random
variable, Z ?  Solution 1  2. Why is the concept of a standardized variable important?  Solution 2  3. What is the probability that a standardized random variable Z is less than or equal to 1.96‚ÄîP( Z <
1.96)?  Solution 3   4. What is the probability that a Z score is greater
than or equal to 1.5 and less than or equal to 2.0‚Äî P(1.5 < Z
< 2.0)?  Solution 4  5. If the population of monthly cell phone bills of a group of students
has a mean of $43.00 ( m = $43.00) and a
standard deviation of $5.70 ( s = $5.70),
what is the probability of selecting a student at random whose
monthly bill is $36.50 or less?  Solution 5  6. The manufacturer of a box of cookies states on the outside of
each box that the product contents weigh 16 ounces. The population of
boxes of cookies has a mean of 16.25 ounces
( m = 16.25 ounces) and a standard deviation
of .30 ounces ( s = .30 ounces).  The manufacturer would like to ensure that the contents of each
box weigh between 15.90 and 16.90 ounces. Less than 15.90 ounces may
lead to customer satisfaction issues, while more than 16.90 ounces
results in too much product being given away in each box. What is the
probability of selecting a box of cookies with product content
weighing between 15.90 and 16.90 ounces?  Solution 6    How To Read a Z Distribution Table       Previous | Next             Use of TI-83 Calculator to Compute Normal Probability Distribution Values ; Compute the Value(s) Given an Area      Since

Z-scores are expressed in terms of standard deviations from their means. Resultantly, these z-scores have a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula for calculating the standard score is given below:    As the formula shows, the standard score is simply the score, minus the mean score, divided by the standard deviation. Therefore, let's return to our two questions.  1. How well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students?  To answer this question, we can re-phrase it as: What percentage (or number) of students scored higher than Sarah and what percentage (or number) of students scored lower than Sarah? First, let's reiterate that Sarah scored 70 out of 100, the mean score was 60, and the standard deviation was 15 (see below).      Score  Mean  Standard Deviation      (X)  ¬µ  s    English Literature  70  60  15    In terms of z-scores, this gives us:    The z-score is 0.67 (to 2 decimal places), but now we need to work out the percentage (or number) of students that scored higher and lower than Sarah. To do this, we need to refer to the standard normal distribution table.      Join the 10,000s of students, academics and professionals who rely on Laerd Statistics.   TAKE THE TOUR  PLANS & PRICING      This table helps us to identify the probability that a score is greater or less than our z-score score. To use the table, which is easier than it might look at first sight, we start with our z-score, 0.67 (if our z-score had more than two decimal places, for example, ours was 0.6667, we would round it up or down accordingly; hence, 0.6667 would become 0.67). The y-axis in the table highlights the first two digits of our z-score and the x-axis the second decimal place. Therefore, we start with the y-axis, finding 0.6, and then move along the x-axis until we find 0.07, before finally reading off the appropriate number; in this case, 0.2514 . This means that the probability of a score being greater than 0.67 is 0.2514. If we look at this as a percentage, we simply times the score by 100; hence 0.2514 x 100 = 25.14%. In other words, around 25% of the class got a better mark than Sarah (roughly 13 students since there is no such thing as part of a student!).  Going back to our question, "How well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students?", clearly we can see that Sarah did better than a large proportion of students, with 74.86% of the class scoring lower than her (100% - 25.14% = 74.86%). We can also see how well she performed relative to the mean score by subtracting her score from the mean (0.5 - 0.2514 = 0.2486). Hence, 24.86% of the scores (0.2486 x 100 = 24.86%) were lower than Sarah's, but above the mean score. However, the key finding is that Sarah's score was not one of the best marks. It wasn't even in the top 10% of scores in the class, even though at first sight we may have expected it to be. This leads us onto the second question.  2. Which students came in the top 10% of the class?  A better way of phrasing this would be to ask: What mark would a student have to achieve to be in the top 10% of the class and qualify for the advanced English Literature class?   ¬´ previous    1  2  3  4    next ¬ª     Home  About Us  Contact Us  Terms & Conditions  Privacy & Cookies ¬© 2013 Lund Research Ltd                                                Skip to Navigation  Skip to UConn Search  Skip to Content                                                                                                A-Z               Neag School of Education Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle     Search this Site Search in https://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/> Search              Toggle navigation       Menu   Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle   Skip to content   Home Types of Research Ethics and Informed Consent Single Subject Research   Overview of Single Subject Research  Making Single-Subject Graphs with Spreadsheet Programs   Qualitative Research   Qualitative Research Paradigm  Participant Observation  In-Depth Interview  Long Interview  Trustworthiness   Content Analysis Historical Research Action Research Experimental / Group Comparisons   Experimental Research  Experimental Research Designs  External Validity  Statistical Babble   Correlations   Introduction to Correlation Research  Sample Scatterplots  Coefficient of Determination  Correlations for Different Types of Data  Statistical Significance  r Critical Value Table  Using Excel to Calculate and Graph Correlation Data  Instructions for Using SPSS to Calculate Pearson‚Äôs r  Mindgap Interactive Correlation Data Set   t Tests   Introduction to t Tests  Standard Error of the Mean Difference  Null and Alternative Hypotheses  Excel Spreadsheet to Calculate t tests  Excel Formula for t Test   ANOVA, Regression, and Chi-Square Measurement Scales Variables Normal Distributions   Introduction to Normal Distributions  Standardized Scores  Averages  Calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation with Excel  Area Under the Normal Curve Calculator   Sampling   Sampling  Random Number Table  Simple Random Sampling  Stratified Random Sampling  Two Stage Cluster Random Sampling  Systematic Sampling  Convenience Sampling  Purposive Sampling  Sample Size  Confidence Intervals and Levels  Sample Size Calculator   Instrument Reliability & Validity   Instrument Reliability  Instrument Validity  Reliability and Validity Concept Map  Excel Spreadsheet to Calculate Instrument Reliability Estimates  Developing an Attitude Instrument  Types of Survey Questions  Survey Pitfalls  Likert Scales   Edufest Research Workshop Material   Edufest Workshop Slides  Accomplishment Plan  Management Plan  Topic Generator  Project Evaluations      Search this Site Search in https://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/> Search                     Standardized Scores    Suppose that you have just completed your midterm for this class and you were told that you had a score of 55. How would you feel?¬† The first question you might ask is how many points were possible?¬† If you were told that 85 points were possible you might not feel too well since you correctly answered about 64% of the questions.  Now let‚Äôs assume that the test was very difficult and the instructor didn‚Äôt expect anyone to have mastered all of the content on it. What other information might you wish to know?¬† Perhaps you would like to know the average (mean) grade on the test. If you were to discover that it was 50, you might feel better about your performance because you were above average.  You might be interested to know how the scores were spread above and below the average (mean). In particular, you are probably wondering how far above the mean you were compared to others in the class. Were most of the grades close to the mean, or were students‚Äô grades far above or below the mean. One way to measure the dispersion or spread of scores is with the range (subtract the low score from the high score). Suppose the range were 30 points with the high being 75 and the low being 45. You might not feel to well about your grade even though it was above the average. The problem with the range is that one extreme score can influence it very much. In this case, maybe only one person earned 75 and the next high was 56 with everyone else falling between 46 and 56, a range of 10.  Instead of using the range, we use the standard deviation when we talk about the spread of scores. In the midterm example, suppose you were told that 68% of the people who took the test has a score from 48 to 52. In other words, 68% of the people fell 2 points above or 2 points below the mean. In that case, we would say that the test scores had a standard deviation of 2. Assuming that the scores fell into a normal distribution, we would also know that 95% of the students would have scores within two standard deviations above or below the mean. In our case that would 4 points above (54) or 4 points below (46) the mean (50). You would feel rather good about your score of 55. Knowing the mean and standard deviation makes it possible to interpret raw scores and compare different individuals‚Äô performances with each other or an individual‚Äôs performance on one test with his or her performance on another test.  Without standardized scores, it is difficult to make comparisons. A raw score of 30 on one test and a raw score of 125 on another test don‚Äôt have much meaning until we know where each score is in relations to the mean. In order for the score to be meaningful, we need to know whether the score is above or below the mean and how far above or below the mean. Unfortunately, knowing that the first score is 2 points above the mean and the second score is 10 points above the mean still doesn‚Äôt help. Each test is different, so being 2 points above the mean may be better than being 10 points above the mean on another test. It is only when we know how many standard deviations¬† each score is above or below the mean that we can compare the two performances. Standard scores allow us to make comparisons of raw scores that come from very different sources.  A common way to make comparisons is to calculate z-scores. A z-score tells how many standard deviations someone is above or below the mean. A z-score of -1.4 indicates that someone is 1.4 standard deviations below the mean. Someone who is in that position would have done as well or better than 8% of the students who took the test.  To calculate a z-score, subtract the mean from the raw score and divide that answer by the standard deviation. (i.e., raw score =15, mean = 10, standard deviation = 4. Therefore 15 minus 10 equals 5.¬† 5 divided by 4 equals 1.25. Thus the z-score is 1.25.)  Lay people are sometimes uncomfortable with z-scores for a couple reasons. First, they don‚Äôt like negative numbers and anyone who has a raw score less than the mean has a negative z-score. Second, they are uncomfortable with a z-score of 0 being average. Explaining to a parent that her child did average on an achievement test and has a z-score of 0 can be difficult. For this reason z-scores are often converted to a scale where negative value are not possible.. IQ scores, SAT scores, and T scores are examples of z-scores that have been converted.  To convert a z-score to a T-score, multiple the z-score by 10 and add 50 to your answers (i.e., z-score = .5.¬†¬† .5 times 10 equal 5. 5 plus 50 equals 55. Therefore, a z-score of .5 converts to a T-score of 55.  As a point of reference, IQs are calculated by multiplying the z-score by 15 (16 on some tests) and then adding 100. SAT scores are calculated by multiplying the z-score by 100 and then adding 500.  To convert a z-score on an IQ measure to an IQ score, multiply the z-score by 15 and add 100 to your answer (e.e., z-score= .5. .5 times 15 equals 7.5 plus 100 equals 107.5. Therefore, a z-score of .5 on an IQ measure converts to a T-score of 107.5.

Claire Boyte-White     Though the finance industry can be complex, an understanding of the calculation and interpretation of basic mathematical building blocks is still the foundation for success, whether in accounting, economics or investing. Standard deviation and Z-score are two such fundamentals. A firm grasp of how to calculate and utilize these two measurements enables a more thorough analysis of patterns and changes in any data set, from business expenditures to stock prices.  Standard deviation is essentially a reflection of the amount of variability within a given data set. To calculate standard deviation, first calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. The differences are then squared, summed and averaged to produce the variance . The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, which brings it back to the original unit of measure.  The Z-score , by contrast, is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. To calculate Z-score, simply subtract the mean from each data point and divide the result by the standard deviation. For data points that are below the mean, the Z-score is negative. In most large data sets, 99% of values have a Z-score between -3 and 3, meaning they lie within three standard deviations above and below the mean.  In investing, standard deviation and Z-score can be useful tools in determining market volatility . As the standard deviation increases, it indicates price action varies widely within the established time frame. Given this information, the Z-score of a particular price indicates how typical or atypical this movement is based on previous performance. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator used by traders and analysts to assess market volatility based on standard deviation. Simply put, they are a visual representation of the Z-score. For any given price, the number of standard deviations from the mean is reflected by the number of Bollinger Bands between the price and the exponential moving average (EMA).

The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation. For the standard normal distribution, 68% of the observations lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% lie within two standard deviation of the mean; and 99.9% lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. To this point, we have been using "X" to denote the variable of interest (e.g., X=BMI, X=height, X=weight). However, when using a standard normal distribution, we will use "Z" to refer to a variable in the context of a standard normal distribution. After standarization, the BMI=30 discussed on the previous page is shown below lying 0.16667 units above the mean of 0 on the standard normal distribution on the right.     ====  Since the area under the standard curve = 1, we can begin to more precisely define the probabilities of specific observation. For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution.¬†Examine the table and note that a "Z" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a "Z" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%. So, the 50% below the mean plus the 34% above the mean gives us 84%.  Probabilities of the Standard Normal Distribution Z         This table is organized to provide the area under the curve to the left of or less of a specified value or "Z value". In this case, because the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1, the Z value is the number of standard deviation units away from the mean, and the area is the probability of observing a value less than that particular Z value. Note also that the table shows probabilities to two decimal places of Z. The units place and the first decimal place are shown in the left hand column, and the second decimal place is displayed across the top row.  But let's get back to the question about the probability that the BMI is less than 30, i.e., P(X<30). We can answer this question using the standard normal distribution. The figures below show the distributions of BMI for men aged 60 and the standard normal distribution side-by-side.  Distribution of BMI and Standard Normal Distribution   ====  The area under each curve is one but the scaling of the X axis is different. Note, however, that the areas to the left of the dashed line are the same. The BMI distribution ranges from 11 to 47, while the standardized normal distribution, Z, ranges from -3 to 3. We want to compute P(X < 30). To do this we can determine the Z value that corresponds to X = 30 and then use the standard normal distribution table above to find the probability or area under the curve. The following formula converts an X value into a Z score , also called a standardized score :   where Œº is the mean and œÉ is the standard deviation of the variable X.  In order to compute P(X < 30) we convert the X=30 to its corresponding Z score (this is called standardizing ):   Thus, P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17). We can then look up the corresponding probability for this Z score from the standard normal distribution table, which shows that P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17) = 0.5675. Thus, the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI less than 30 is 56.75%.  Another Example  Using the same distribution for BMI, what is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI exceeding 35? In other words, what is P(X > 35)? Again we standardize:   We now go to the standard normal distribution table to look up P(Z>1) and for Z=1.00 we find that P(Z<1.00) = 0.8413. Note, however, that the table always gives the probability that Z is less than the specified value, i.e., it gives us P(Z<1)=0.8413.   Therefore, P(Z>1)=1-0.8413=0.1587. Interpretation: Almost 16% of men aged 60 have BMI over 35.  Normal Probability Calculator         Z-Scores with R  As an alternative to looking up normal probabilities in the table or using Excel, we can use R to compute probabilities. For example,  > pnorm(0)  [1] 0.5  A Z-score of 0 (the mean of any distribution) has 50% of the area to the left. What is the probability that a 60 year old man in the population above has a BMI less than 29 (the mean)? The Z-score would be 0, and pnorm(0)=0.5 or 50%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI less than 30? The Z-score was 0.16667.  > pnorm(0.16667)  [1] 0.5661851  So, the probabilty is 56.6%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI greater than 35?  35-29=6, which is one standard deviation above the mean. So we can compute the area to the left  > pnorm(1)  [1] 0.8413447  and then subtract the result from 1.0.  1-0.8413447= 0.1586553  So the probability of a 60 year ld man having a BMI greater than 35 is 15.8%.  Or, we can use R to compute the entire thing in a single step as follows:  > 1-pnorm(1)  [1] 0.1586553    Probability for a Range of Values   What is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI between 30 and 35? Note that this is the same as asking what proportion of men aged 60 have BMI between 30 and 35. Specifically, we want P(30 < X < 35)? We previously computed P(30<X) and P(X<35); how can these two results be used to compute the probability that BMI will be between 30 and 35? Try to formulate and answer on your own before looking at the explanation below.  Answer     Now consider BMI in women. What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI less than 30? We use the same approach, but for women aged 60 the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 7.  Answer     What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI exceeding 40? Specifically, what is P(X > 40)?  Answer     return to top | previous page | next page     Content ¬©2016. All Rights Reserved. Date last modified: July 24, 2016. Wayne W. LaMorte, MD, PhD, MPH Boston University School of Public Health            z score Calculator    The probability of a result x in an experiment consisting of a
large number of equally probable independent trials n is
approximated by the normal probability density function :     where Œº, the mean value , is n /2 and
œÉ,
the standard deviation , is a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for experiments with two equally probable outcomes
of each trial is:     Since the mean value and standard deviation depend upon the number
of trials in the experiment, comparison between experiments
with differing numbers of trials is facilitated by standardising the result: transforming it
to a distribution with mean value zero and standard deviation
of 1.  A normally distributed experimental result x is thus standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing
by the standard deviation of the experiment:     This z-value or z score expresses the
divergence of the experimental result x from the
most probable result Œº as a number of standard
deviations œÉ
The larger the value of z , the less probable the
experimental result is due to chance.  The probability
can be calculated from the cumulative standard
normal distribution :     Which gives the probability P that an experimental
result with a z value less than or equal to that
observed is due to chance.  Subtracting P from one:     gives Q , the probability that the observed z score is due to chance.  Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for P , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  This page allows you to calculate the
probability of chance occurrence of a given z , or to
calculate z given a probability Q .  All
calculations are performed with six decimal places of accuracy; the
maximum z accepted is 6.  Note that the probability calculated from the z is an approximation which is valid only for large
values of n , and is therefore only meaningful when
calculated for experiments with a large number of
individual trials.   In order to use this page, your browser must support JavaScript.

The standard score does this by converting (in other words, standardizing) scores in a normal distribution to z-scores in what becomes a standard normal distribution. To explain what this means in simple terms, let's use an example (if needed, see our statistical guide, Normal Distribution Calculations , for background information on normal distribution calculations).  Setting the scene: Part 1  A tutor sets a piece of English Literature coursework for the 50 students in his class. We make the assumption that when the scores are presented on a histogram, the data is found to be normally distributed. The mean score is 60 out of 100 and the standard deviation (in other words, the variation in the scores) is 15 marks (see our statistical guides, Measures of Central Tendency and Standard Deviation , for more information about the mean and standard deviation).  Having looked at the performance of the tutor's class, one student, Sarah, has asked the tutor if, by scoring 70 out of 100, she has done well. Bearing in mind that the mean score was 60 out of 100 and that Sarah scored 70, then at first sight it may appear that since Sarah has scored 10 marks above the 'average' mark, she has achieved one of the best marks. However, this does not take into consideration the variation in scores amongst the 50 students (in other words, the standard deviation). After all, if the standard deviation is 15, then there is a reasonable amount of variation amongst the scores when compared with the mean.  Whilst Sarah has still scored much higher than the mean score, she has not necessarily achieved one of the best marks in her class. The question arises: How well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students? Before answering this question, let us look at another problem.      Join the 10,000s of students, academics and professionals who rely on Laerd Statistics.   TAKE THE TOUR  PLANS & PRICING      The tutor has a dilemma. In the next academic year, he must choose which of his students have performed well enough to be entered into an advanced English Literature class. He decides to use the coursework scores as an indicator of the performance of his students. As such, he feels that only those students that are in the top 10% of the class should be entered into the advanced English Literature class. The question arises: Which students came in the top 10% of the class?  Therefore, we are left with two questions to answer. First, how well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students? Second, which students came in the top 10% of the class?  Whilst it is possible to calculate the answer to both of these questions using the existing mean score and standard deviation, this is very complex. Therefore, statisticians have come up with probability distributions , which are ways of calculating the probability of a score occurring for a number of common distributions, such as the normal distribution. In our case, we make the assumption that the students' scores are normally distributed. As such, we can use something called the standard normal distribution and its related z-scores to answer these questions much more easily.  Standard Normal Distribution and Standard Score (z-score)  When a frequency distribution is normally distributed, we can find out the probability of a score occurring by standardising the scores, known as standard scores (or z scores). The standard normal distribution simply converts the group of data in our frequency distribution such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 (see below).       1  2  3  4    next ¬ª     Home  About Us  Contact Us  Terms & Conditions  Privacy & Cookies ¬© 2013 Lund Research Ltd               Search       Statistics How To   Statistics for the rest of us!

How to Find a Z-Score in Excel.  How to find a critical z-value on the TI-83.    1. What is a Z-Score?  Simply put, a z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean a data point is. But more technically it‚Äôs a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. A z-score is also known as a standard score and it can be placed on a normal distribution curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). In order to use a z-score, you need to know the mean Œº and also the population standard deviation œÉ.  Z-scores are a way to compare results from a test to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù population. Results from tests or surveys have thousands of possible results and units. However, those results can often seem meaningless. For example, knowing that someone‚Äôs weight is 150 pounds might be good information, but if you want to compare it to the ‚Äú average ‚Äù person‚Äôs weight, looking at a vast table of data can be overwhelming (especially if some weights are recorded in kilograms). A z-score can tell you where that person‚Äôs weight is compared to the average population‚Äôs mean weight.   Back to Top  2. Z Score Formulas  The Z Score Formula: One Sample  The basic z score formula for a sample is:  z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / œÉ For example, let‚Äôs say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (Œº) of 150 and a standard deviation (œÉ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution , your z score would be: z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / œÉ = 190 ‚Äì 150 / 25 = 1.6. The z score tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your score is. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.  You may also see the z score formula shown to the left. This is exactly the same formula as z = x ‚Äì Œº / œÉ, except that xÃÑ (the sample mean ) is used instead of Œº (the population mean) and s (the sample standard deviation ) is used instead of œÉ (the population standard deviation). However, the steps for solving it are exactly the same.   Z Score Formula: Standard Error of the Mean  When you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those sample means ( the standard error ), you would use this z score formula:  z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / (œÉ / ‚àön) This z-score will tell you how many standard errors there are between the sample mean and the population mean.  Sample problem: In general, the mean height of women is 65‚Ä≥ with a standard deviation of 3.5‚Ä≥. What is the probability of finding a random sample of 50 women with a mean height of 70‚Ä≥, assuming the heights are normally distributed?  z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / (œÉ / ‚àön) = (70 ‚Äì 65) / (3.5/‚àö50) = 5 / 0.495 = 10.1  The key here is that we‚Äôre dealing with a sampling distribution of means, so we know we have to include the standard error in the formula. We also know that 99% of values fall within 3 standard deviations from the mean in a normal probability distribution (see 68 95 99.7 rule ). Therefore, there‚Äôs less than 1% probability that any sample of women will have a mean height of 70‚Ä≥.  Confused about when to use œÉ and when to use œÉ ‚àön? See: Sigma / sqrt (n) ‚Äî why is it used?  Back to Top  3. How to Calculate a Z-Score  You can easily calculate a z-score on a TI-83 calculator or in Excel . However, if you don‚Äôt have either, you can calculate it by hand.   Sample question: You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?  Step 1: Write your X-value into the z-score equation . For this sample question the X-value is your SAT score, 1100.   Step 2: Put the mean, Œº, into the z-score equation .   Step 3: Write the standard deviation, œÉ into the z-score equation .   Step 4: Calculate the answer using a calculator : (1100 ‚Äì 1026) / 209 = .354. This means that your score was .354 std devs above the mean.  Step 5: ( Optional ) Look up your z-value in the z-table to see what percentage of test-takers scored below you. A z-score of .354 is .1368 + .5000* =  .6368 or 63.68%.  *Why add .500 to the result? The z-table shown has scores for the RIGHT of the mean. Therefore, we have to add .500 for all of the area LEFT of the mean. For more examples of when to add (or subtract) .500, see several examples in: Area under a normal distribution curve .  Like the explanation? Check out the Practically Cheating Statistics Handbook , which has hundreds more step-by-step explanations, just like this one!  Back to Top  4. Z scores and Standard Deviations  Technically, a z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean value of the reference population (a population whose known values have been recorded, like in these charts the CDC compiles about people‚Äôs weights). For example:   A z-score of 1 is 1 standard deviation above the mean .  A score of 2 is 2 standard deviations above the mean .  A score of -1.8 is -1.8 standard deviations  below the mean .   A z-score tells you where the score lies on a normal distribution curve. A z-score of zero tells you the values is exactly average while a score of +3 tells you that the value is much higher than average.  Back to Top  5. How is it Used in Real Life?  You can use the z-table and the normal distribution graph to give you a visual about how a z-score of 2.0 means ‚Äúhigher than average‚Äù. Let‚Äôs say you have a person‚Äôs weight (240 pounds), and you know their z-score is 2.0. You know that 2.0 is above average (because of the high placement on the normal distribution curve), but you want to know how much above average is this weight?   The z-score in the center of the curve is zero. The z-scores to the right of the mean are positive and the z-scores to the left of the mean are negative . If you look up the score in the z-table , you can tell what percentage of the population is above or below your score. The table below shows a z-score of 2.0 highlighted, showing .9772 (which converts to 97.72%). If you look at the same score (2.0) of the normal distribution curve above, you‚Äôll see it corresponds with 97.72%.  That tells you 97.72% of the population‚Äôs scores lie below that particular score and 100% ‚Äì 97.72% = 2.28% of the scores lie above that score. A mere 2.28 of the population is above this person‚Äôs weight‚Ä¶.probably a good indication they need to go on a diet!  Technology  1. How to Find a Z-Score on the TI-89  The TI-89 Titanium‚Äôs Stats/List Editor contains a simple menu where you can look up a Z Score in seconds. This section shows you how to find the z-score for a critical value in a left tail. The normal distribution curve is symmetrical, so this will also be the area in a right tail as well.  Not sure if your test is a left tailed or right tailed? See ‚Äú Left Tailed Test or Right Tailed ‚Äù to help you decide.  Note that you must have the Stats/List Editor installed to be able to make a TI-89 frequency distribution using these instructions.  Z Score TI 89: Steps  Watch the video or read the steps below:   Sample problem : find the z score for Œ± = .012 for a left-tailed test on a standard normal distribution curve.  Step 1: Press Apps , scroll to the Stats/List Editor , and press ENTER. If you don‚Äôt see the Stats/List Editor, you can download it here . It‚Äôs an official TI app and you‚Äôll need to transfer it to your calculator using the cable that originally came with your TI-89.  Step 2: Press F5 2 1, to get to the Inverse Normal screen.  Step 3: Enter .012 in the Area box.  Step 4: Enter 0 for the mean , Œº and 1 for the standard deviation , œÉ.  Step 5: Press ENTER.  Step 6: Read the result: the calculator should state ‚Äú Inverse = -2.25713 ‚Äú. This is your z score.  Tip : If you are given a mean and standard deviation , enter them in place of 0 and 1 in Step 4.  That‚Äôs how to find a z score TI 89!  2. How to Find a Z-Score in Excel  Z-Score in Excel: Overview  A z-score tells you how many standard deviations a certain piece of data (‚ÄúX‚Äù) is above or below the mean. A z-score in Excel can quickly be calculated using a basic formula. The formula for calculating a z-score is z=(x-Œº)/œÉ, where Œº is the population mean and œÉ is the population standard deviation (note: if you don‚Äôt know the population standard deviation or the sample size is below 6, you should use a t-score instead of a z-score). In other words, the formula is z = (data point ‚Äì mean) / standard deviation.  Z-Score in Excel: Steps  Watch the video or read the steps below:   Sample question: You take the GRE and scored 650 in the verbal section of the test. Calculate a z-score in Excel to determine how good your score is compared to the general population of test takers. The population mean (Œº) is 469 and the population standard deviation (œÉ) is 119.  Step 1: Type the population mean into a blank cell. For this example, type ‚Äú469‚Äù into cell A2. Optional: type the word ‚Äú mean ‚Äù as a column header in cell A1 so you remember what the value in cell A2 stands for. Step 2: Enter the population standard deviation into a blank cell . For this example, type ‚Äú119‚Äù into cell B2. Optional: type the words ‚Äústandard deviation‚Äù as a column header in cell B1 so you remember what the value in cell B2 stands for. Step 3: Type the X-value (in this sample problem, X is your GRE score) into a blank cell. For this example, type ‚Äú650‚Äù into cell C2. Optional: type the words ‚ÄúX‚Äù as a column header in cell B1 so you remember what the value in cell B2 stands for. Step 4: Enter the following formula into an empty cell: =(C2-A2)/B2 Step 5: Press ‚ÄúEnter.‚Äù The z-score will appear in cell D2: The z-score of 1.521008 in this sample problem indicates your GRE score was 1.521008. That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve found a z-score in Excel. Tip: Once you‚Äôve entered the formula once, you can use it over and over again. Just type a new mean, standard deviation and X value into the relevant boxes. Reference: CDC.

like to calculate the probability of its value occurring in the
interval of the mean plus or minus .5 standard deviations. How would
you go about calculating the probability?  One method is to standardize the random variable. Standardization
of a normally distributed random variable enables an analyst or
researcher to determine with ease the probability associated with a
range of values for that variable by using a standardized
distribution table. A normally distributed random variable can be
standardized using a formula. The letter Z represents the
standardized random variable and the probabilities associated with
ranges of values of Z can be found in a Z distribution table. Read on to learn more about how to calcultate (and
apply) the standardized normally distributed random variable Z .  Standard Normal Distribution The standardized value of a normally distributed random variable
is called a Z score and is calculated using the following
formula.   x = the value that is being standardized  m = the mean of the distribution  s = standard deviation of the
distribution  As the formula shows, a random variable is standardized by
subtracting the mean of the distribution from the value being
standardized, and then dividing this difference by the standard
deviation of the distribution. Once standardized, a normally
distributed random variable has a mean of zero and a standard deviation
of one. The standard normal distribution ( Z distribution) is
shown in the graph below. As you can see from the notation to the
right of the curve, m z = 0 and s z = 1.       Learn How to Calculate the Mean of
a Standard Normal Distribution   To see how a random variable is standardized, imagine you have a
random variable, x , that is normally distributed with a mean
of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. What would be the standardized
value ( Z score) of 40? To solve this problem, you would use
the Z score formula. Using the information from the example,
you know that  x = 40  m = 20  s = 10  Substitute these numbers into the formula and solve.   In this example, the standardized value ( Z score) of 40
is 2.  These Z scores are important because they tell you how far a
value is from the mean. When you standardize a random variable, its
mean becomes zero and its standard deviation becomes one; therefore,  if the Z score of x is zero, then the value of x is equal to the mean.  if the Z score of x is one, then the value of x is one standard deviation above the mean. If the Z score is ‚Äì1, then the value of x is one standard
deviation below the mean.  If the Z score of x is two, then the value of x is two standard deviations above the mean. If the Z score is ‚Äì2, then the value of x is two standard
deviations below the mean.  In the earlier example, the Z score of 40 was 2. This
tells you that 40 is 2 standard deviations above the mean. Consider
three other values from the same distribution and their Z scores, shown in the table below.   As the table shows, the value of 10 has a Z score of ‚Äì1,
which means it is one standard deviation below the mean. The value of
20 has a Z score of 0, which means it is equal to the mean.
And the value of 30 has a Z score of 1, which means it is
one standard deviation above the mean.  Calculating Probability Within a Desired Range The Z score allows you to calculate the probability that
a normally distributed random variable x will fall within a
desired range. As an example, consider an apparel company that
produces garments in China and then ships them to the United States
for and sale.  Let the random variable x be the time required to
transport the product from the manufacturing facility in China to the
United States. Suppose that x is normally distributed with a
mean of 24 days and a standard deviation of 3 days. What is the
probability that a shipment will arrive within 30 days‚ÄîP( x less than or equal to 30)?  To determine the probability, you must first calculate the Z score. With the information from the example, you know
that  x = 30  m = 24  s = 3  Substitute this information into the Z score formula,
and standardize the value of 30, as shown below.     Learn How to Calculate the
Standard Deviation of a Standard Normal Distribution   The next step in determining the probability that the shipment
will arrive within 30 days is to use a Z distribution table.
This table will tell you the probability associated with a given Z score.    Z Distribution Table   The Z distribution is a normal distribution that looks
much like the graph below. The figures in the table show the
probability that a random variable x will fall within the
range to the left of the Z score (from negative infinity up
to the Z score.) Consider the diagram below for a more
intuitive understanding of this concept. If you looked up a Z score of two in a Z distribution table, you would
find that the probability listed in the table represents the pink
shaded area under the curve in the illustration. If you are
interested in the probability of the clear area under the curve‚ÄîP( Z >
2)‚Äîyou would have to subtract the probability
found in the table from one to determine the probability of Z greater than two.   As you might expect, a Z score of zero, when looked up
in the table, yields a probability of .5. This makes sense if you
remember the definition of a normal distribution having half of its
values distributed on either side of the mean.  Returning to the example of apparel shipments, you can look up
the Z score of 2.00 in the table to find the probability that the
shipment will arrive within 30 days. The probability can be found by
looking first down the left-hand column of the table for the number
2.0. Since the number after the decimal point is zero, use the first
column titled .00 for the probability. The probability that Z will be less than or equal to 2.0 is .9772. (This number
is highlighted in this Z table .) This
means that the probability that the shipment will arrive within 30
days is .9772.  With any normally distributed random variable, you can find the
probability of the variable x falling between two values: calculate the Z score of each value, look up their
probabilities in a Z distribution table, and then
subtract the smaller probability from the larger one. The difference
is the probability of the random variable x falling between
the two values.  For a demonstration of finding the probability of an interval of
values, consider again the apparel manufacturer example from above.
Calculate the probability of an apparel shipment arriving within the
range of 22 to 26 days, using above data for m x and s x of 24 days and 3 days,
respectively.  To solve this problem, first standardize the
variables at each end of the interval in question. Calculate the Z value using the following formula for Z .   First, for the lower end of the interval of 22 days, calculate the Z value.   Then, for the upper end of the interval of 26 days, calculate the Z value.   Now look up the probability of each standardized random variable Z in a Z distribution table. The probability
associated with the standardized random variable ‚Äì.67 is .2514 (a
value which is determined by calculating 1 ‚Äì .7486). The probability
associated with the standardized random variable .67 is .7486.  To find the probability of an interval, subtract the lower end of
the interval from the upper end of the interval.   The probability of an apparel shipment arriving in 22 to 26 days
is .4972.   1. What is the assumed distribution behind a standardized random
variable, Z ?  Solution 1  2. Why is the concept of a standardized variable important?  Solution 2  3. What is the probability that a standardized random variable Z is less than or equal to 1.96‚ÄîP( Z <
1.96)?  Solution 3   4. What is the probability that a Z score is greater
than or equal to 1.5 and less than or equal to 2.0‚Äî P(1.5 < Z
< 2.0)?  Solution 4  5. If the population of monthly cell phone bills of a group of students
has a mean of $43.00 ( m = $43.00) and a
standard deviation of $5.70 ( s = $5.70),
what is the probability of selecting a student at random whose
monthly bill is $36.50 or less?  Solution 5  6. The manufacturer of a box of cookies states on the outside of
each box that the product contents weigh 16 ounces. The population of
boxes of cookies has a mean of 16.25 ounces
( m = 16.25 ounces) and a standard deviation
of .30 ounces ( s = .30 ounces).  The manufacturer would like to ensure that the contents of each
box weigh between 15.90 and 16.90 ounces. Less than 15.90 ounces may
lead to customer satisfaction issues, while more than 16.90 ounces
results in too much product being given away in each box. What is the
probability of selecting a box of cookies with product content
weighing between 15.90 and 16.90 ounces?  Solution 6    How To Read a Z Distribution Table       Previous | Next             Use of TI-83 Calculator to Compute Normal Probability Distribution Values ; Compute the Value(s) Given an Area      Since

Z-scores are expressed in terms of standard deviations from their means. Resultantly, these z-scores have a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula for calculating the standard score is given below:    As the formula shows, the standard score is simply the score, minus the mean score, divided by the standard deviation. Therefore, let's return to our two questions.  1. How well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students?  To answer this question, we can re-phrase it as: What percentage (or number) of students scored higher than Sarah and what percentage (or number) of students scored lower than Sarah? First, let's reiterate that Sarah scored 70 out of 100, the mean score was 60, and the standard deviation was 15 (see below).      Score  Mean  Standard Deviation      (X)  ¬µ  s    English Literature  70  60  15    In terms of z-scores, this gives us:    The z-score is 0.67 (to 2 decimal places), but now we need to work out the percentage (or number) of students that scored higher and lower than Sarah. To do this, we need to refer to the standard normal distribution table.      Join the 10,000s of students, academics and professionals who rely on Laerd Statistics.   TAKE THE TOUR  PLANS & PRICING      This table helps us to identify the probability that a score is greater or less than our z-score score. To use the table, which is easier than it might look at first sight, we start with our z-score, 0.67 (if our z-score had more than two decimal places, for example, ours was 0.6667, we would round it up or down accordingly; hence, 0.6667 would become 0.67). The y-axis in the table highlights the first two digits of our z-score and the x-axis the second decimal place. Therefore, we start with the y-axis, finding 0.6, and then move along the x-axis until we find 0.07, before finally reading off the appropriate number; in this case, 0.2514 . This means that the probability of a score being greater than 0.67 is 0.2514. If we look at this as a percentage, we simply times the score by 100; hence 0.2514 x 100 = 25.14%. In other words, around 25% of the class got a better mark than Sarah (roughly 13 students since there is no such thing as part of a student!).  Going back to our question, "How well did Sarah perform in her English Literature coursework compared to the other 50 students?", clearly we can see that Sarah did better than a large proportion of students, with 74.86% of the class scoring lower than her (100% - 25.14% = 74.86%). We can also see how well she performed relative to the mean score by subtracting her score from the mean (0.5 - 0.2514 = 0.2486). Hence, 24.86% of the scores (0.2486 x 100 = 24.86%) were lower than Sarah's, but above the mean score. However, the key finding is that Sarah's score was not one of the best marks. It wasn't even in the top 10% of scores in the class, even though at first sight we may have expected it to be. This leads us onto the second question.  2. Which students came in the top 10% of the class?  A better way of phrasing this would be to ask: What mark would a student have to achieve to be in the top 10% of the class and qualify for the advanced English Literature class?   ¬´ previous    1  2  3  4    next ¬ª     Home  About Us  Contact Us  Terms & Conditions  Privacy & Cookies ¬© 2013 Lund Research Ltd                                                Skip to Navigation  Skip to UConn Search  Skip to Content                                                                                                A-Z               Neag School of Education Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle     Search this Site Search in https://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/> Search              Toggle navigation       Menu   Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle   Skip to content   Home Types of Research Ethics and Informed Consent Single Subject Research   Overview of Single Subject Research  Making Single-Subject Graphs with Spreadsheet Programs   Qualitative Research   Qualitative Research Paradigm  Participant Observation  In-Depth Interview  Long Interview  Trustworthiness   Content Analysis Historical Research Action Research Experimental / Group Comparisons   Experimental Research  Experimental Research Designs  External Validity  Statistical Babble   Correlations   Introduction to Correlation Research  Sample Scatterplots  Coefficient of Determination  Correlations for Different Types of Data  Statistical Significance  r Critical Value Table  Using Excel to Calculate and Graph Correlation Data  Instructions for Using SPSS to Calculate Pearson‚Äôs r  Mindgap Interactive Correlation Data Set   t Tests   Introduction to t Tests  Standard Error of the Mean Difference  Null and Alternative Hypotheses  Excel Spreadsheet to Calculate t tests  Excel Formula for t Test   ANOVA, Regression, and Chi-Square Measurement Scales Variables Normal Distributions   Introduction to Normal Distributions  Standardized Scores  Averages  Calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation with Excel  Area Under the Normal Curve Calculator   Sampling   Sampling  Random Number Table  Simple Random Sampling  Stratified Random Sampling  Two Stage Cluster Random Sampling  Systematic Sampling  Convenience Sampling  Purposive Sampling  Sample Size  Confidence Intervals and Levels  Sample Size Calculator   Instrument Reliability & Validity   Instrument Reliability  Instrument Validity  Reliability and Validity Concept Map  Excel Spreadsheet to Calculate Instrument Reliability Estimates  Developing an Attitude Instrument  Types of Survey Questions  Survey Pitfalls  Likert Scales   Edufest Research Workshop Material   Edufest Workshop Slides  Accomplishment Plan  Management Plan  Topic Generator  Project Evaluations      Search this Site Search in https://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/> Search                     Standardized Scores    Suppose that you have just completed your midterm for this class and you were told that you had a score of 55. How would you feel?¬† The first question you might ask is how many points were possible?¬† If you were told that 85 points were possible you might not feel too well since you correctly answered about 64% of the questions.  Now let‚Äôs assume that the test was very difficult and the instructor didn‚Äôt expect anyone to have mastered all of the content on it. What other information might you wish to know?¬† Perhaps you would like to know the average (mean) grade on the test. If you were to discover that it was 50, you might feel better about your performance because you were above average.  You might be interested to know how the scores were spread above and below the average (mean). In particular, you are probably wondering how far above the mean you were compared to others in the class. Were most of the grades close to the mean, or were students‚Äô grades far above or below the mean. One way to measure the dispersion or spread of scores is with the range (subtract the low score from the high score). Suppose the range were 30 points with the high being 75 and the low being 45. You might not feel to well about your grade even though it was above the average. The problem with the range is that one extreme score can influence it very much. In this case, maybe only one person earned 75 and the next high was 56 with everyone else falling between 46 and 56, a range of 10.  Instead of using the range, we use the standard deviation when we talk about the spread of scores. In the midterm example, suppose you were told that 68% of the people who took the test has a score from 48 to 52. In other words, 68% of the people fell 2 points above or 2 points below the mean. In that case, we would say that the test scores had a standard deviation of 2. Assuming that the scores fell into a normal distribution, we would also know that 95% of the students would have scores within two standard deviations above or below the mean. In our case that would 4 points above (54) or 4 points below (46) the mean (50). You would feel rather good about your score of 55. Knowing the mean and standard deviation makes it possible to interpret raw scores and compare different individuals‚Äô performances with each other or an individual‚Äôs performance on one test with his or her performance on another test.  Without standardized scores, it is difficult to make comparisons. A raw score of 30 on one test and a raw score of 125 on another test don‚Äôt have much meaning until we know where each score is in relations to the mean. In order for the score to be meaningful, we need to know whether the score is above or below the mean and how far above or below the mean. Unfortunately, knowing that the first score is 2 points above the mean and the second score is 10 points above the mean still doesn‚Äôt help. Each test is different, so being 2 points above the mean may be better than being 10 points above the mean on another test. It is only when we know how many standard deviations¬† each score is above or below the mean that we can compare the two performances. Standard scores allow us to make comparisons of raw scores that come from very different sources.  A common way to make comparisons is to calculate z-scores. A z-score tells how many standard deviations someone is above or below the mean. A z-score of -1.4 indicates that someone is 1.4 standard deviations below the mean. Someone who is in that position would have done as well or better than 8% of the students who took the test.  To calculate a z-score, subtract the mean from the raw score and divide that answer by the standard deviation. (i.e., raw score =15, mean = 10, standard deviation = 4. Therefore 15 minus 10 equals 5.¬† 5 divided by 4 equals 1.25. Thus the z-score is 1.25.)  Lay people are sometimes uncomfortable with z-scores for a couple reasons. First, they don‚Äôt like negative numbers and anyone who has a raw score less than the mean has a negative z-score. Second, they are uncomfortable with a z-score of 0 being average. Explaining to a parent that her child did average on an achievement test and has a z-score of 0 can be difficult. For this reason z-scores are often converted to a scale where negative value are not possible.. IQ scores, SAT scores, and T scores are examples of z-scores that have been converted.  To convert a z-score to a T-score, multiple the z-score by 10 and add 50 to your answers (i.e., z-score = .5.¬†¬† .5 times 10 equal 5. 5 plus 50 equals 55. Therefore, a z-score of .5 converts to a T-score of 55.  As a point of reference, IQs are calculated by multiplying the z-score by 15 (16 on some tests) and then adding 100. SAT scores are calculated by multiplying the z-score by 100 and then adding 500.  To convert a z-score on an IQ measure to an IQ score, multiply the z-score by 15 and add 100 to your answer (e.e., z-score= .5. .5 times 15 equals 7.5 plus 100 equals 107.5. Therefore, a z-score of .5 on an IQ measure converts to a T-score of 107.5.

Claire Boyte-White     Though the finance industry can be complex, an understanding of the calculation and interpretation of basic mathematical building blocks is still the foundation for success, whether in accounting, economics or investing. Standard deviation and Z-score are two such fundamentals. A firm grasp of how to calculate and utilize these two measurements enables a more thorough analysis of patterns and changes in any data set, from business expenditures to stock prices.  Standard deviation is essentially a reflection of the amount of variability within a given data set. To calculate standard deviation, first calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. The differences are then squared, summed and averaged to produce the variance . The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, which brings it back to the original unit of measure.  The Z-score , by contrast, is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. To calculate Z-score, simply subtract the mean from each data point and divide the result by the standard deviation. For data points that are below the mean, the Z-score is negative. In most large data sets, 99% of values have a Z-score between -3 and 3, meaning they lie within three standard deviations above and below the mean.  In investing, standard deviation and Z-score can be useful tools in determining market volatility . As the standard deviation increases, it indicates price action varies widely within the established time frame. Given this information, the Z-score of a particular price indicates how typical or atypical this movement is based on previous performance. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator used by traders and analysts to assess market volatility based on standard deviation. Simply put, they are a visual representation of the Z-score. For any given price, the number of standard deviations from the mean is reflected by the number of Bollinger Bands between the price and the exponential moving average (EMA).
