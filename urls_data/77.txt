Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.   Information about options: PCOS Fertility Treatment Options and Success Rates      PCOS fertility treatment options include:    Clomid for PCOS   Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS   Metformin for PCOS   Injectable Gonadotropins for PCOS   IVF - In Vitro Fertilization for PCOS       Diagnosing PCO  How do doctors diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?     Diagnosing PCO with ultrasound - What does a polycystic ovary look like?  In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, also called antral follicles , give the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.

Watch the video to discover that some of the ‘facts’ often taken for granted are really just myths, and then uncover the truth.    (X) MYTH: It's possible to get pregnant at any time of the month.  (✓) FACT: To get pregnant, you need to have sex on the days leading up to and around when you ovulate. The two to three days prior to ovulation, and the day of ovulation itself, being your most fertile days. Once the egg has gone (usually within a day of ovulation) you cannot get pregnant until after your next menstrual cycle has started. So methods that tell you when you have ovulated are of no help if you are trying to conceive.   (X) MYTH: Menstrual cycles are always 28 days long and every woman ovulates on Day 14.  (✓)FACT: The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but every woman is unique and nearly 50% of women’s cycles vary by 7 days or more 1 . As menstrual cycles vary in length, so does the timing of ovulation, so it can be difficult to know when your fertile days are.     (X) MYTH: You'll get pregnant quickly if you track your temperature.  (✓)FACT: A woman's body temperature rises after she has ovulated by which time it is too late to optimize the chances of conception in that menstrual cycle.   (X) MYTH: I never used a hormonal birth control method, so we should get pregnant as soon as we start trying.  (✓)FACT: Just because your hormones haven’t been affected by hormonal contraceptives doesn't necessarily put you at an advantage. Your body may be better able to regulate itself but this doesn't mean you can get pregnant any more easily. Your fertility can be influenced by many factors other than contraceptives.   (X) MYTH: I conceived my first baby easily, so the next pregnancy should be easy  (✓)FACT: There’s no sure way of knowing. You’ll be older, you’ll definitely have less time to be spontaneous with your sex life and you may even have a different partner – all of these influence your chances of pregnancy. If you are under 35 and have been trying to get pregnant for a year, talk to your doctor (six months if you are over 35). A woman‘s natural fertility begins to gradually decline in her late 20s and by the time she reaches age 35, the quantity and quality of her eggs will begin to drop rapidly. If you have concerns or questions consult your doctor.   (X) MYTH: You can't get pregnant during your period  (✓)FACT: If you have a very short menstrual cycle, but bleed for many days at the beginning of your menstrual cycle, it is possible that you may already be within the beginning of your fertility window before your bleeding has stopped.   (X) MYTH: Being stressed will stop me getting pregnant and using an Ovulation Test will make it worse  (✓)FACT: While stress is never healthy, unless it’s interrupting your periods or sex life it won’t stop you conceiving. It has been suggested that using ovulation tests to time intercourse on the most fertile days can be stressful, but a recent study by Prof. William Ledger and Clearblue found that using these tests is no more stressful than trying to conceive without them. In fact, in this study 77% more women got pregnant in the group that were using the tests 3 . Also remember it’s normal for sex to start to feel mechanical if you’ve been trying for a baby for a while. This is something a lot of couples experience and it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with your relationship. Most couples accept that baby-making sex can be different.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

For a healthy, fertile couple where both partners are under the age of 35, the chance of getting pregnant straight away is actually pretty low – it’s estimated at around 25 percent per month, if you have regular unprotected sex around the time of ovulation .  If you’re not actively trying to conceive and not planning intercourse to occur around the time of conception , but you are having regular unprotected sex, your chances of getting pregnant drop to just 11 percent per month.  That’s why doctors have traditionally suggested waiting until you have been trying for a baby for a year before starting fertility investigations , although many couples choose to start preliminary investigations after six months, particularly if they are over thirty.  How do the chances of getting pregnant change as I get older?  On average, a woman with no fertility issues will fall pregnant after four months of trying to get pregnant – but from around the age of 21, fertility slowly declines with age until around 35, then declines faster until the age of 40, after which fertility decline is very rapid.  There is much debate between scientists about the odds of conception.  Here is one of the most commonly cited estimates on the percentage chance of conception after one year of trying:   Age 20: 90% probability  Age 30: 70% probability  Age 35: 55% probability  Age 40: 45% probability  Age 45: 6% probability   A 2002 study by Dunson et al studied 782 healthy couples in Italy and the USA and found that there was great variability in the chances of getting pregnant on the peak day of conception (two days before ovulation). They estimated that, for a couple who were the same age, the odds of falling pregnant in any one menstrual cycle when having sex on the peak day for conception were:   Aged 19 to 26: 50% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 27 to 34: 40% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 35 to 39: less than 30% chance in any one menstrual cycle, but with a male partner five years older, the chance falls to less than 20% chance in any one menstrual cycle   This research suggested that smoking, sexually transmitted disease history and occupational exposures contributed to lower fertility rates.  Can IVF improve fertility rates for older women?  Increased use of assisted conception treatments by older couples has helped promote the idea that fertility treatments like IVF can postpone the natural decline of fertility.  However, success rates for IVF still mirror those of natural fertility, with reports issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) show that the rate of live births from IVF and similar treatments using the mother’s eggs decreases with age.  The latest figures show that for women under 35, the percentage of live births after one cycle of assisted reproductive treatments (including IVF ) was about 45%.  Success rates declined after this age group. For those between ages 35-37 it was about 37%, dropping steadily to just 6.6% for those aged over 42.  But older women can dramatically raise their IVF success rates by using an egg donor; the CDC report states that the chance of a fertilised egg implanting depends on the age of the woman who produced the egg.  Success rates for women, even in their mid-forties, who use a donor egg from a woman in her 20s or early 30s remains above 40%.  Many women have no trouble falling pregnant over 35 or even over forty; but if you’re over 35 and haven’t fallen pregnant after six months, it’s worth talking to your doctor and starting fertility investigations.  What can be done to improve my odds?  Plenty of products, consultants and websites promise to improve your chances of getting pregnant – for a price. But many are rip-offs with no scientific evidence, which prey on the vulnerability of people keen to have a baby.  Here’s some tips on improving your chances of getting pregnant , without paying a fortune:  Reduce your stress levels  There’s a strong correlation between stress levels and fertility. If the main reason you’re stressed is that you want to have a baby, then this is hollow-sounding advice indeed.But there are often ways you can change other stresses in your life; take a holiday; re-think your job or other commitments that might shift down your priority list.  Aim for a healthy weight  Research shows that there is a strong connection between obesity in women and lower fertility. Being significantly underweight for long periods of time can also negatively impact your fertility. Try for a healthy balance!  Improve your diet  While research evidence is inconclusive, some fertility experts swear by a diet of organic foods. It’s your choice whether to go all-out or just keep an eye on your food choices (eating at home and avoiding takeaway is a good start!)  Quit smoking and cut back on the booze  There’s a strong link between smoking and reduced fertility in both men and women; this might be enough of an incentive to help you kick the habit.  Regular exercise  You don’t have to become a gym junkie – in fact, it’s better if you’re not – but some regular exercise each day can’t hurt; and if a nice long walk reduces your stress levels and improves your cardio status, it might well help your chances of getting pregnant.

Doctors explain how likely that really is for the average person. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Images If you spend years actively avoiding pregnancy , it can be a surprise to get pregnant pretty quickly, much less the first time you try. That's exactly what happened to NCIS: New Orleans star Zoe McLellan. “For me, it was a bit too easy,” the 41-year-old actor said in an episode of People 's video series " Mom Talk ." McLellan said she told her then-boyfriend that she was looking to become a mom, and it happened right away. “We got pregnant the first time we had sex,” she says. “Pretty fast and furious.” We’ve all heard these stories of women who become pregnant as soon as they decide they want to be, but how common is that, really? Not very, but a fair amount of women get pregnant fairly quickly, Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. This is what she tells her wannabe-pregnant patients (assuming they have unprotected sex twice a week): “50 percent will be pregnant within three months, 75 percent will be pregnant in six months, 90 percent will be pregnant in one year, and 95 percent will be pregnant in two years.” There are a few indicators that getting pregnant may be easier for you than for other women, Lauren Streicher, M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. They include having regular periods (not just every month, but consistently the same number of days in each cycle), and having PMS symptoms like sore breasts and cramps before your period. These are all signs that your cycle is on track. Of course, it’s not always super-easy for many women to get pregnant, even if they time it correctly. “When you ovulate, the egg is only good for 24 hours each,” Whelihan says. “Even if you have [unprotected] sex on the right day of the month, there’s still only a 20 percent chance of conceiving [from that session].” Since sperm can live in your uterus for a few days, she recommends “getting some in there in advance” of ovulating. Ease of conceiving also depends on a woman’s age, says Streicher: “There’s a very big difference between what is expected for a 25-year-old and a 40-year-old." Streicher tells her older patients who say they want to start trying that they should begin tracking their ovulation . If they’re not ovulating regularly or haven’t gotten pregnant within four months, they should see their doctor. And in general, “If [a woman over 35] has been trying for four months, it’s an appropriate time to look at things,” she says. On the other hand, if you're under 35, doctors typically recommend that you wait until you’ve been trying for a year before seeing them to talk about possible next steps. It’s important to remember that it’s not necessarily about you. “When patients aren’t conceiving, 40 percent of the reasons are due to male factors, like low sperm count and bad swimmers,” Whelihan says. No matter what, if you don’t get pregnant right away, try to worry as little as possible—even though that can be incredibly tough—and manage your stress in a healthy way. "The time it takes a person to get pregnant varies significantly from woman to woman," women's health expert Jennifer Wider , M.D., tells SELF. "Unfortunately, it isn't something we can control, so stressing over it usually doesn't help." If you’re ready to get pregnant, like, yesterday, it’s natural that you wouldn’t want to wait a whole year to see what's going on, and experts get that. There's no rule that says you absolutely have to wait before calling up your doctor. “I tell women they have to be very proactive,” Streicher says. As soon as you talk your concerns over with a medical professional, you'll be one step closer to actually getting pregnant.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.   Information about options: PCOS Fertility Treatment Options and Success Rates      PCOS fertility treatment options include:    Clomid for PCOS   Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS   Metformin for PCOS   Injectable Gonadotropins for PCOS   IVF - In Vitro Fertilization for PCOS       Diagnosing PCO  How do doctors diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?     Diagnosing PCO with ultrasound - What does a polycystic ovary look like?  In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, also called antral follicles , give the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.

Watch the video to discover that some of the ‘facts’ often taken for granted are really just myths, and then uncover the truth.    (X) MYTH: It's possible to get pregnant at any time of the month.  (✓) FACT: To get pregnant, you need to have sex on the days leading up to and around when you ovulate. The two to three days prior to ovulation, and the day of ovulation itself, being your most fertile days. Once the egg has gone (usually within a day of ovulation) you cannot get pregnant until after your next menstrual cycle has started. So methods that tell you when you have ovulated are of no help if you are trying to conceive.   (X) MYTH: Menstrual cycles are always 28 days long and every woman ovulates on Day 14.  (✓)FACT: The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but every woman is unique and nearly 50% of women’s cycles vary by 7 days or more 1 . As menstrual cycles vary in length, so does the timing of ovulation, so it can be difficult to know when your fertile days are.     (X) MYTH: You'll get pregnant quickly if you track your temperature.  (✓)FACT: A woman's body temperature rises after she has ovulated by which time it is too late to optimize the chances of conception in that menstrual cycle.   (X) MYTH: I never used a hormonal birth control method, so we should get pregnant as soon as we start trying.  (✓)FACT: Just because your hormones haven’t been affected by hormonal contraceptives doesn't necessarily put you at an advantage. Your body may be better able to regulate itself but this doesn't mean you can get pregnant any more easily. Your fertility can be influenced by many factors other than contraceptives.   (X) MYTH: I conceived my first baby easily, so the next pregnancy should be easy  (✓)FACT: There’s no sure way of knowing. You’ll be older, you’ll definitely have less time to be spontaneous with your sex life and you may even have a different partner – all of these influence your chances of pregnancy. If you are under 35 and have been trying to get pregnant for a year, talk to your doctor (six months if you are over 35). A woman‘s natural fertility begins to gradually decline in her late 20s and by the time she reaches age 35, the quantity and quality of her eggs will begin to drop rapidly. If you have concerns or questions consult your doctor.   (X) MYTH: You can't get pregnant during your period  (✓)FACT: If you have a very short menstrual cycle, but bleed for many days at the beginning of your menstrual cycle, it is possible that you may already be within the beginning of your fertility window before your bleeding has stopped.   (X) MYTH: Being stressed will stop me getting pregnant and using an Ovulation Test will make it worse  (✓)FACT: While stress is never healthy, unless it’s interrupting your periods or sex life it won’t stop you conceiving. It has been suggested that using ovulation tests to time intercourse on the most fertile days can be stressful, but a recent study by Prof. William Ledger and Clearblue found that using these tests is no more stressful than trying to conceive without them. In fact, in this study 77% more women got pregnant in the group that were using the tests 3 . Also remember it’s normal for sex to start to feel mechanical if you’ve been trying for a baby for a while. This is something a lot of couples experience and it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with your relationship. Most couples accept that baby-making sex can be different.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

For a healthy, fertile couple where both partners are under the age of 35, the chance of getting pregnant straight away is actually pretty low – it’s estimated at around 25 percent per month, if you have regular unprotected sex around the time of ovulation .  If you’re not actively trying to conceive and not planning intercourse to occur around the time of conception , but you are having regular unprotected sex, your chances of getting pregnant drop to just 11 percent per month.  That’s why doctors have traditionally suggested waiting until you have been trying for a baby for a year before starting fertility investigations , although many couples choose to start preliminary investigations after six months, particularly if they are over thirty.  How do the chances of getting pregnant change as I get older?  On average, a woman with no fertility issues will fall pregnant after four months of trying to get pregnant – but from around the age of 21, fertility slowly declines with age until around 35, then declines faster until the age of 40, after which fertility decline is very rapid.  There is much debate between scientists about the odds of conception.  Here is one of the most commonly cited estimates on the percentage chance of conception after one year of trying:   Age 20: 90% probability  Age 30: 70% probability  Age 35: 55% probability  Age 40: 45% probability  Age 45: 6% probability   A 2002 study by Dunson et al studied 782 healthy couples in Italy and the USA and found that there was great variability in the chances of getting pregnant on the peak day of conception (two days before ovulation). They estimated that, for a couple who were the same age, the odds of falling pregnant in any one menstrual cycle when having sex on the peak day for conception were:   Aged 19 to 26: 50% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 27 to 34: 40% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 35 to 39: less than 30% chance in any one menstrual cycle, but with a male partner five years older, the chance falls to less than 20% chance in any one menstrual cycle   This research suggested that smoking, sexually transmitted disease history and occupational exposures contributed to lower fertility rates.  Can IVF improve fertility rates for older women?  Increased use of assisted conception treatments by older couples has helped promote the idea that fertility treatments like IVF can postpone the natural decline of fertility.  However, success rates for IVF still mirror those of natural fertility, with reports issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) show that the rate of live births from IVF and similar treatments using the mother’s eggs decreases with age.  The latest figures show that for women under 35, the percentage of live births after one cycle of assisted reproductive treatments (including IVF ) was about 45%.  Success rates declined after this age group. For those between ages 35-37 it was about 37%, dropping steadily to just 6.6% for those aged over 42.  But older women can dramatically raise their IVF success rates by using an egg donor; the CDC report states that the chance of a fertilised egg implanting depends on the age of the woman who produced the egg.  Success rates for women, even in their mid-forties, who use a donor egg from a woman in her 20s or early 30s remains above 40%.  Many women have no trouble falling pregnant over 35 or even over forty; but if you’re over 35 and haven’t fallen pregnant after six months, it’s worth talking to your doctor and starting fertility investigations.  What can be done to improve my odds?  Plenty of products, consultants and websites promise to improve your chances of getting pregnant – for a price. But many are rip-offs with no scientific evidence, which prey on the vulnerability of people keen to have a baby.  Here’s some tips on improving your chances of getting pregnant , without paying a fortune:  Reduce your stress levels  There’s a strong correlation between stress levels and fertility. If the main reason you’re stressed is that you want to have a baby, then this is hollow-sounding advice indeed.But there are often ways you can change other stresses in your life; take a holiday; re-think your job or other commitments that might shift down your priority list.  Aim for a healthy weight  Research shows that there is a strong connection between obesity in women and lower fertility. Being significantly underweight for long periods of time can also negatively impact your fertility. Try for a healthy balance!  Improve your diet  While research evidence is inconclusive, some fertility experts swear by a diet of organic foods. It’s your choice whether to go all-out or just keep an eye on your food choices (eating at home and avoiding takeaway is a good start!)  Quit smoking and cut back on the booze  There’s a strong link between smoking and reduced fertility in both men and women; this might be enough of an incentive to help you kick the habit.  Regular exercise  You don’t have to become a gym junkie – in fact, it’s better if you’re not – but some regular exercise each day can’t hurt; and if a nice long walk reduces your stress levels and improves your cardio status, it might well help your chances of getting pregnant.

Doctors explain how likely that really is for the average person. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Images If you spend years actively avoiding pregnancy , it can be a surprise to get pregnant pretty quickly, much less the first time you try. That's exactly what happened to NCIS: New Orleans star Zoe McLellan. “For me, it was a bit too easy,” the 41-year-old actor said in an episode of People 's video series " Mom Talk ." McLellan said she told her then-boyfriend that she was looking to become a mom, and it happened right away. “We got pregnant the first time we had sex,” she says. “Pretty fast and furious.” We’ve all heard these stories of women who become pregnant as soon as they decide they want to be, but how common is that, really? Not very, but a fair amount of women get pregnant fairly quickly, Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. This is what she tells her wannabe-pregnant patients (assuming they have unprotected sex twice a week): “50 percent will be pregnant within three months, 75 percent will be pregnant in six months, 90 percent will be pregnant in one year, and 95 percent will be pregnant in two years.” There are a few indicators that getting pregnant may be easier for you than for other women, Lauren Streicher, M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. They include having regular periods (not just every month, but consistently the same number of days in each cycle), and having PMS symptoms like sore breasts and cramps before your period. These are all signs that your cycle is on track. Of course, it’s not always super-easy for many women to get pregnant, even if they time it correctly. “When you ovulate, the egg is only good for 24 hours each,” Whelihan says. “Even if you have [unprotected] sex on the right day of the month, there’s still only a 20 percent chance of conceiving [from that session].” Since sperm can live in your uterus for a few days, she recommends “getting some in there in advance” of ovulating. Ease of conceiving also depends on a woman’s age, says Streicher: “There’s a very big difference between what is expected for a 25-year-old and a 40-year-old." Streicher tells her older patients who say they want to start trying that they should begin tracking their ovulation . If they’re not ovulating regularly or haven’t gotten pregnant within four months, they should see their doctor. And in general, “If [a woman over 35] has been trying for four months, it’s an appropriate time to look at things,” she says. On the other hand, if you're under 35, doctors typically recommend that you wait until you’ve been trying for a year before seeing them to talk about possible next steps. It’s important to remember that it’s not necessarily about you. “When patients aren’t conceiving, 40 percent of the reasons are due to male factors, like low sperm count and bad swimmers,” Whelihan says. No matter what, if you don’t get pregnant right away, try to worry as little as possible—even though that can be incredibly tough—and manage your stress in a healthy way. "The time it takes a person to get pregnant varies significantly from woman to woman," women's health expert Jennifer Wider , M.D., tells SELF. "Unfortunately, it isn't something we can control, so stressing over it usually doesn't help." If you’re ready to get pregnant, like, yesterday, it’s natural that you wouldn’t want to wait a whole year to see what's going on, and experts get that. There's no rule that says you absolutely have to wait before calling up your doctor. “I tell women they have to be very proactive,” Streicher says. As soon as you talk your concerns over with a medical professional, you'll be one step closer to actually getting pregnant.
