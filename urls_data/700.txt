Millions of women take it with confidenceand rightly so.  But to be fully effective, birth control pills need to be taken correctly. Missing even a few doses greatly increases your chances of pregnancy: while only 0.1 percent of women get pregnant when using the pill properly, pregnancy rates soar by 30-80 times when pills are missed.  This information can help you setand stick toa routine thats right for you.   Skipping Pills Greatly Increases the Chance of Pregnancy    Your life. Your routine.   Given how important it is to take your pills regularly, its essential that you establish a routine that works for you. Does it fit your schedule? Are you more likely to remember your pill in the morning or at night? How will you remind yourself? Its best if you take your pill at the same time every day. Try to make it part of something your do already, like taking vitamins in the morning or brushing your teeth before bed. If that doesnt suit you, how about right after dinner or with your first cup of coffee? Be it morning, noon or night, taking your pills at a consistent time is the quickest way to develop a new routine. Three more good ideas:  Pack your pills. Even if you take them at home or work, carry your pills with you at all times. That way, youll have them on hand if youre suddenly called away or realize that you forgot to take one. Mark your calendar. Try to pick up your pill packs on the same day every month, and then mark your calendar. Many women pick up their packs every two months, on the first day of the month. The 3-month rule. If youre new to the pill, be sure to call or visit your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider after three months for a quick checkup. Its a great chance to discuss your experience and any questions you might have. Find the routine thats right for you. And stick with it!   If you miss a pill...   Never skip a pill on purposeeven if you bleed between periods, miss a period, get headaches or feel queasy. All of these are normal side effects which some women experience and which usually disappear after three menstrual cycles. (If youre concerned, or the symptoms are severe, call your health care provider.) As for skipping a pill by accident... We all slip up now and then, and its likely that youll eventually forget to take a pill. If you miss just one, dont worrytake it as soon as you remember and take the next pill at your regular time.*  If you miss two or more pills, you must do two things:  Call your doctor. Different pills have different instructions for missed doses. Your health care provider can tell you what to do to get back on track. Use a back-up. Because of the missed pills, you have a much greater chance of getting pregnant. So even though youre back on schedule, you also need to use a back-up method of contraception  like a condom, or spermicide  for the rest of your cycle.  Also use a back up method when:      A note about STIs Keep in mind that the pill only help prevent pregnancy. It does not protect you from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papillomavirus (which causes genital warts), syphilis and genital herpesall of which can harm your health and hurt your chances of getting pregnant later on. If youre concerned about STIs, be sure sure you or your partner use a latex condom every time. Your cycle requires it. If your period begins on a day other than Sunday just before you begin taking a Sunday-start pill, you should use a back-up method for the next seven days. You are vomiting or have diarrhea. They can interfere with your bodys absorption of the pill, and raise your chance of pregnancy. Us a back-up for the rest your cycle. *Note: If youre on a 28-day pill program, and you forget to take one or two of your reminder pills (the last seven in the pack), dont worry. Throw away the ones you missed and keep taking one a day until the pack is empty.  REMEMBER: MISS ONE, MAKE IT UP. MISS TWO, BACK IT UP.

Privacy Statement | Terms & Conditions          Newsletter Is There a Chance of Getting Pregnant While Taking Birth Control? Medically reviewed by Nicole Galan, RN on  February 2, 2016 — Written by Kimberly Holland Pregnancy signs and symptoms Causes aside from pregnancy If you think you’re pregnant Pregnancy prevention Overview  Birth control is 99 percent effective when it’s used perfectly. “Perfect use” means that it’s taken at the same time every day without any exceptions. “Typical use” refers to how it’s most commonly used. This accounts for taking the pill at slightly different times or accidently missing a day. With typical use, birth control is about 91 percent effective.  Despite these high percentages, it’s still possible for you to get pregnant. Birth control failure is often the result of missing two or more pills in a row. Without the constant supply of hormones, you may begin ovulating . If you have unprotected sex during this time, your chances of becoming pregnant increase.  Keep reading to learn whether the symptoms you’re experiencing are signs of pregnancy or just side effects of your birth control.  Pregnancy signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms
of pregnancy  The earliest signs of pregnancy share many of the same characteristics as the side effects of the birth control pill. This may include:  A missed period  Birth control can make your period very light . This light bleeding can be confused with implantation bleeding , which occurs when a fertilized egg implants into the uterus . It can also cause you to have breakthrough bleeding, which is bleeding between periods . Birth control can even cause you to miss a period , which can be confused with a sign of pregnancy.  Nausea  Morning sickness , which can happen at any time of the day, can indicate that you’re pregnant. Birth control pills can also cause nausea . If taking your pill with food doesn’t help alleviate the nausea, you may want to take a pregnancy test.  Breast tenderness  As your pregnancy continues, your breasts may become tender to the touch. Hormonal birth control pills can also cause breast tenderness .  Fatigue and headaches  Fatigue is a common symptom of pregnancy. Altered hormonal levels from birth control pills can also cause excessive tiredness and headaches .  Causes aside from pregnancy What else can cause
these symptoms?  In addition to possible pregnancy and birth control side effects, there are a few other conditions that may explain some of the symptoms you’re experiencing. These can include:  Sexually transmitted infections  Although  birth control prevents pregnancy in most cases, it doesn’t protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Some STIs can cause cramping, bleeding, and nausea.  Cancer  Certain cancers , including cervical or endometrial cancer, can cause symptoms that could be confused with pregnancy or birth control side effects.  These symptoms include:  bleeding cramping nausea pain fatigue  Fibroids or cysts  Fibroids and cysts are unusual growths that can develop on a woman’s uterus or ovaries . Most people with either of the conditions experience unusual bleeding, which is often very heavy. Still, it’s possible some of the other symptoms, such as nausea, pain, and increased urination could be present before any bleeding begins.  Risks of taking birth control while pregnant  If you were taking birth control to prevent pregnancy but find out weeks later that you’re indeed pregnant, it’s natural to wonder what effect your birth control may have on a developing fetus . The good news is that birth control has been shown to be safe in early pregnancy.  Of course, no guarantee can be made that the medication hasn’t affected the baby’s development , so be sure to see your doctor as soon as you suspect or find out that you’re pregnant. If you test positive, you should stop taking your birth control pill.  Becoming pregnant while on birth control does increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy . An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized embryo attaches outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube . This is a very serious, life-threatening problem and should be cared for immediately.  If you think you’re pregnant What to do if you
think you’re pregnant  If you think you may be pregnant, find out as soon as you can so you can begin prenatal care . Over-the-counter pregnancy tests are extremely accurate. There are many options available on Amazon.com. Take more than one if you want. You can even ask your doctor’s office for an at-home test.  Alternatively, make an appointment to see your doctor to discuss the symptoms you’re experiencing. As part of the routine checkup , your doctor will likely conduct a pregnancy test. You can request one, too. By the end of the appointment, you’ll know if you’re expecting or not. Take this quiz to see whether you might have the symptoms of pregnancy.  Pregnancy prevention Preventing an
unplanned pregnancy  With typical use, birth control pills are still a highly effective form of pregnancy prevention. You can actually make it more effective by following a few simple strategies:  Get on a routine  Take the pill every day at the same time. Doing this maintains your hormone levels and decreases the risk of ovulation.  Don’t skip placebo pills  Even though placebo pills contain no active ingredients, you should still take them. Skipping those pills may interrupt your routine. You may not begin your next pack on time, and this can increase your chances of ovulation.  Limit alcohol intake  Alcohol can affect the way your liver metabolizes your medication. This can reduce its effectiveness.  Use backup protection  In certain circumstances, it will be important for you to use a barrier method or another form of birth control . Some medications may reduce your pill’s effectiveness. You should use another form of protection for a least one month after finishing any additional medicines.  Consider emergency birth control  If you have unprotected sex and then realize you skipped a pill or two, you can take emergency birth control, such as Plan B . You can take this for up to five days after you’ve had unprotected intercourse. The sooner you take it, the more effective it will be. Call your doctor if you have questions about this type of birth control.  Healthline and our partners may receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link above.

Answers from Yvonne Butler Tobah, M.D.    Taking birth control pills during early pregnancy doesn't appear to increase the risk of birth defects.  While some research has suggested a link between the use of birth control pills near conception and an increased risk of low birth weight, preterm birth or congenital urinary tract abnormalities, these concerns generally haven't been observed in clinical experience.  Birth control pills overall lower the risk of pregnancy and the risk of a fertilized egg implanting outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), which most often occurs in one of the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). However, if you do conceive while taking a progestin-only birth control (minipill), there's a slightly higher chance that the pregnancy will be ectopic.  As a precaution, if you suspect you're pregnant, take a home pregnancy test. If the home pregnancy test is positive, stop taking the pill. If taking a home pregnancy test isn't possible, stop taking the birth control pill until the pregnancy is confirmed or ruled out. In the meantime, use another method of birth control — such as condoms.  If you're concerned because you took birth control pills before you knew you were pregnant, talk to your health care provider, but be assured that there's little risk.

Medically reviewed by Michael Weber, MD on  October 18, 2016 — Written by Jessica Timmons Effectiveness Causes Prevention Pregnancy symptoms Pregnancy Next steps Intro  Yes. Although birth control pills have a high success rate, they can fail and you can get pregnant while on the pill. Certain factors increase your risk of getting pregnant, even if you’re on birth control. Keep these factors in mind if you’re sexually active and want to prevent an unplanned pregnancy.  Effectiveness Success and
failure rates of birth control pills  Birth control pills are 99 percent effective with “perfect use,” which means taking the pill at the same time every day without missing a dose. “Typical use” is how most women take the pill, and then it’s about 91 percent effective. Both combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only pills (also known as the mini pill) have a typical failure rate of 9 percent.  Many women accidentally miss a dose or forget to start a new pack of pills. When that happens, the chances for an accidental pregnancy go up.  The Pregnancy Quiz: Am I Pregnant? »  Causes What causes birth
control to fail  Certain conditions or behaviors can increase the likelihood that your birth control won’t be as effective at preventing pregnancy.  If you can’t remember to take your pill at the same time every day, you increase your risk of pregnancy. Birth control pills are designed to maintain a constant level of hormones in your body. If you skip or miss a dose, you hormone levels can drop quickly. Depending on where you are in your cycle, this may cause you to ovulate . Ovulation can increase your chances of becoming pregnant.  Reckless alcohol consumption can also cause birth control failure. While under the influence, some women may forget to take their pill at the correct time. If you vomit too soon after taking your pill, your body may not be able to absorb any of the hormones. This can result in a drop in your hormone levels, which could trigger ovulation.  Taking another medication or supplement at the same time as your birth control pill can also affect the pill’s effectiveness.  Prevention How to prevent birth
control failure  Keep these tips in mind if you’re on birth control and want to prevent pregnancy.  Time it right  Make sure you take your birth control pill at the same time every day. Set a reminder on your phone or watch if you need to. You may also consider taking the pill with a specific daily activity, such as during lunch or dinner.  If you take progestin-only pills, you should be especially careful about taking the pill at the same time every day. If you’re late with a dose or skip one altogether, your hormone levels can drop very quickly. This could cause you to ovulate and that greatly increases your chances for getting pregnant.  If you miss a dose, use a backup method or avoid sex for the next week. To be extra cautious, use a backup method, such as a condom , or avoid sex for the next month.  Take the placebo pills  Combination pill packs typically contain three weeks of active pills that contain hormones and one week of inactive, or placebo, pills. Although it isn’t medically necessary to take the placebo pills, doing so can help you stay in your routine.  If you choose to skip the placebo pills, there’s a chance that you may be late in starting your next pill pack. This can interrupt your body’s expected level of hormones and cause you to ovulate. Ovulation increases your chances of being pregnant.  Don’t mix medications  Some prescription and over-the-counter medications may interfere with your birth control’s effectiveness. Before you begin taking a new medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should use a backup method of protection while taking this new medication.  Although some antibiotics have been anecdotally connected to unplanned pregnancies, research has largely debunked this connection. A possible connection with reduced birth control effectiveness is only recognized with one type of uncommon antibiotic called rifampin .  Don’t use St. John’s wort  St. John’s wort is a popular over-the-counter herbal supplement that can affect liver metabolism. This supplement can interfere with birth control’s effectiveness. You could experience breakthrough bleeding and possibly an unplanned pregnancy if you take the two medicines together. Talk with your doctor about any additional measures you should take, including a backup protection method while you’re taking St. John’s wort.  Knowing what can make your birth control ineffective and how you can increase your chances for successfully avoiding pregnancy will help you make the best decisions for yourself.  Pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of pregnancy  The earliest symptoms of pregnancy can be easily overlooked, especially if you’re on birth control. If you experience any of these symptoms, take a pregnancy test to confirm your pregnancy status. If you want to double check the at-home pregnancy test, a simple blood test by your doctor can confirm your status.  The early signs of pregnancy include:  tender or swollen breasts (hormonal changes can affect the way your breasts feel) a sudden aversion to certain foods or scents unusual food cravings  Morning sickness  Nausea, vomiting, and fatigue are also signs of early pregnancy. Contrary to its name, morning sickness can occur at any time of the day. It can begin very early after conception. While your body adjusts to the new pregnancy, you may also find yourself growing tired more easily or more quickly.  Missed period  Many women begin suspecting they’re pregnant when they miss a period . Unfortunately, some women don’t have a period while on birth control, so a missed period may not necessarily be an easy indicator.  Implementation bleeding , which happens when a fertilized egg attaches to your uterus, can be mistaken for a period. This is especially true if your period is typically very light.  Pregnancy What to do if you're pregnant  If you discover that you’re pregnant , you should speak with your doctor as soon as possible. If you plan to keep the pregnancy, you’ll need to start caring for your growing baby. This means going off of the birth control pill and beginning to take a daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. You’ll also have to begin preparing for an upcoming delivery.  If you decide you’d like to terminate the pregnancy, you should begin this process as quickly as you can. Depending on where you live, legal restrictions could prevent you from having the procedure after you’ve reached a certain point in the pregnancy.  Can birth control harm your baby?  You may also worry that taking birth control pills could have harmed your developing baby. According to the Mayo Clinic , this doesn’t appear to the case. Some research showed a link between birth control during early pregnancy with issues low birth weight, abnormalities to the urinary tract, and preterm delivery, but little has been observed clinically. It’s important to stop taking the pill as soon as you suspect pregnancy, but your baby shouldn’t be at a greater risk of defects.  Next steps Next steps  If it’s taken correctly, birth control is a wonderful method for preventing pregnancy and helping with a number of other conditions, including acne and painful menstrual cramps. As with any medicine, taking it the way it’s designed to be taken is of utmost importance. If you don’t, you could end up becoming pregnant.  Knowing what can make your birth control ineffective and how you can increase your chances of successfully avoiding pregnancy will help you make the best decisions for you and your lifestyle.

If you experience any of these symptoms, take a pregnancy test to confirm your pregnancy status. If you want to double check the at-home pregnancy test, a simple blood test by your doctor can confirm your status.  The early signs of pregnancy include:  tender or swollen breasts (hormonal changes can affect the way your breasts feel) a sudden aversion to certain foods or scents unusual food cravings  Morning sickness  Nausea, vomiting, and fatigue are also signs of early pregnancy. Contrary to its name, morning sickness can occur at any time of the day. It can begin very early after conception.

Missed period  Many women begin suspecting they’re pregnant when they miss a period . Unfortunately, some women don’t have a period while on birth control, so a missed period may not necessarily be an easy indicator.  Implementation bleeding , which happens when a fertilized egg attaches to your uterus, can be mistaken for a period. This is especially true if your period is typically very light.  Pregnancy What to do if you're pregnant  If you discover that you’re pregnant , you should speak with your doctor as soon as possible. If you plan to keep the pregnancy, you’ll need to start caring for your growing baby. This means going off of the birth control pill and beginning to take a daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. You’ll also have to begin preparing for an upcoming delivery.  If you decide you’d like to terminate the pregnancy, you should begin this process as quickly as you can. Depending on where you live, legal restrictions could prevent you from having the procedure after you’ve reached a certain point in the pregnancy.  Can birth control harm your baby?  You may also worry that taking birth control pills could have harmed your developing baby. According to the Mayo Clinic , this doesn’t appear to the case. Some research showed a link between birth control during early pregnancy with issues low birth weight, abnormalities to the urinary tract, and preterm delivery, but little has been observed clinically. It’s important to stop taking the pill as soon as you suspect pregnancy, but your baby shouldn’t be at a greater risk of defects.  Next steps Next steps  If it’s taken correctly, birth control is a wonderful method for preventing pregnancy and helping with a number of other conditions, including acne and painful menstrual cramps. As with any medicine, taking it the way it’s designed to be taken is of utmost importance. If you don’t, you could end up becoming pregnant.

Build Number: 12823 Newsletter Can You Get Pregnant on the Pill? Medically reviewed by Michael Weber, MD on  October 18, 2016 — Written by Jessica Timmons Effectiveness Causes Prevention Pregnancy symptoms Pregnancy Next steps Intro  Yes. Although birth control pills have a high success rate, they can fail and you can get pregnant while on the pill. Certain factors increase your risk of getting pregnant, even if you’re on birth control. Keep these factors in mind if you’re sexually active and want to prevent an unplanned pregnancy.  Effectiveness Success and
failure rates of birth control pills  Birth control pills are 99 percent effective with “perfect use,” which means taking the pill at the same time every day without missing a dose. “Typical use” is how most women take the pill, and then it’s about 91 percent effective. Both combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only pills (also known as the mini pill) have a typical failure rate of 9 percent.  Many women accidentally miss a dose or forget to start a new pack of pills. When that happens, the chances for an accidental pregnancy go up.  The Pregnancy Quiz: Am I Pregnant? »  Causes What causes birth
control to fail  Certain conditions or behaviors can increase the likelihood that your birth control won’t be as effective at preventing pregnancy.  If you can’t remember to take your pill at the same time every day, you increase your risk of pregnancy. Birth control pills are designed to maintain a constant level of hormones in your body. If you skip or miss a dose, you hormone levels can drop quickly. Depending on where you are in your cycle, this may cause you to ovulate . Ovulation can increase your chances of becoming pregnant.  Reckless alcohol consumption can also cause birth control failure. While under the influence, some women may forget to take their pill at the correct time. If you vomit too soon after taking your pill, your body may not be able to absorb any of the hormones. This can result in a drop in your hormone levels, which could trigger ovulation.  Taking another medication or supplement at the same time as your birth control pill can also affect the pill’s effectiveness.  Prevention How to prevent birth
control failure  Keep these tips in mind if you’re on birth control and want to prevent pregnancy.  Time it right  Make sure you take your birth control pill at the same time every day. Set a reminder on your phone or watch if you need to. You may also consider taking the pill with a specific daily activity, such as during lunch or dinner.  If you take progestin-only pills, you should be especially careful about taking the pill at the same time every day. If you’re late with a dose or skip one altogether, your hormone levels can drop very quickly. This could cause you to ovulate and that greatly increases your chances for getting pregnant.  If you miss a dose, use a backup method or avoid sex for the next week. To be extra cautious, use a backup method, such as a condom , or avoid sex for the next month.  Take the placebo pills  Combination pill packs typically contain three weeks of active pills that contain hormones and one week of inactive, or placebo, pills. Although it isn’t medically necessary to take the placebo pills, doing so can help you stay in your routine.  If you choose to skip the placebo pills, there’s a chance that you may be late in starting your next pill pack. This can interrupt your body’s expected level of hormones and cause you to ovulate. Ovulation increases your chances of being pregnant.  Don’t mix medications  Some prescription and over-the-counter medications may interfere with your birth control’s effectiveness. Before you begin taking a new medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should use a backup method of protection while taking this new medication.  Although some antibiotics have been anecdotally connected to unplanned pregnancies, research has largely debunked this connection. A possible connection with reduced birth control effectiveness is only recognized with one type of uncommon antibiotic called rifampin .  Don’t use St. John’s wort  St. John’s wort is a popular over-the-counter herbal supplement that can affect liver metabolism. This supplement can interfere with birth control’s effectiveness. You could experience breakthrough bleeding and possibly an unplanned pregnancy if you take the two medicines together. Talk with your doctor about any additional measures you should take, including a backup protection method while you’re taking St. John’s wort.

If that doesnt suit you, how about right after dinner or with your first cup of coffee? Be it morning, noon or night, taking your pills at a consistent time is the quickest way to develop a new routine. Three more good ideas:  Pack your pills. Even if you take them at home or work, carry your pills with you at all times. That way, youll have them on hand if youre suddenly called away or realize that you forgot to take one. Mark your calendar. Try to pick up your pill packs on the same day every month, and then mark your calendar. Many women pick up their packs every two months, on the first day of the month. The 3-month rule. If youre new to the pill, be sure to call or visit your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider after three months for a quick checkup. Its a great chance to discuss your experience and any questions you might have. Find the routine thats right for you. And stick with it!   If you miss a pill...   Never skip a pill on purposeeven if you bleed between periods, miss a period, get headaches or feel queasy. All of these are normal side effects which some women experience and which usually disappear after three menstrual cycles. (If youre concerned, or the symptoms are severe, call your health care provider.) As for skipping a pill by accident... We all slip up now and then, and its likely that youll eventually forget to take a pill. If you miss just one, dont worrytake it as soon as you remember and take the next pill at your regular time.*  If you miss two or more pills, you must do two things:  Call your doctor. Different pills have different instructions for missed doses. Your health care provider can tell you what to do to get back on track. Use a back-up. Because of the missed pills, you have a much greater chance of getting pregnant. So even though youre back on schedule, you also need to use a back-up method of contraception  like a condom, or spermicide  for the rest of your cycle.  Also use a back up method when:      A note about STIs Keep in mind that the pill only help prevent pregnancy. It does not protect you from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papillomavirus (which causes genital warts), syphilis and genital herpesall of which can harm your health and hurt your chances of getting pregnant later on. If youre concerned about STIs, be sure sure you or your partner use a latex condom every time. Your cycle requires it. If your period begins on a day other than Sunday just before you begin taking a Sunday-start pill, you should use a back-up method for the next seven days. You are vomiting or have diarrhea. They can interfere with your bodys absorption of the pill, and raise your chance of pregnancy. Us a back-up for the rest your cycle. *Note: If youre on a 28-day pill program, and you forget to take one or two of your reminder pills (the last seven in the pack), dont worry. Throw away the ones you missed and keep taking one a day until the pack is empty.  REMEMBER: MISS ONE, MAKE IT UP. MISS TWO, BACK IT UP.

		            June 16, 2008   Fox News       Facebook 0  Twitter 0  Email  Print      More than 12 million U.S. women use the combined oral contraceptive pill, more commonly referred to as the pill.  The pill is 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. Even so, between 2 and 8 percent of women become pregnant each year while using it.  And doctors say it’s not the pill that’s failing women, but women failing the pill.  Click here to discuss this story.  “The biggest thing that we know of, that affects the efficacy of the pill, is misuse by patients who do not follow the program as prescribed,” said Dr. Millicent Comrie, founder and director of the Long Island College Hospital Center for Women’s Health and vice chairman of the college’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Here are five things that may cause the pill to become less effective or even fail:  1.) Not taking the pill at the same time every day . Because of health concerns, the level of estrogen in birth control pills has been significantly decreased since it was first introduced in the U.S. in 1960. Modern pills, often referred to as “low-dose” pills, contain about 20 micrograms of estrogen, which is less than half the 50 micrograms pills once contained. Because of this, it’s more important than ever that woman take their pills everyday at the same time, said Comrie.  2.) Missing a dose . Worse than not taking the pill at the same time every day is missing a day, said Comrie.  “Once you miss one pill, you should double up,” Comrie said. “And if you have any kind of breakthrough bleeding, you should use a condom. With the lose-dose pills, you have to be very careful when you miss a dose.”  3.) Alcohol . That’s right, that glass of wine with dinner or that fruity alcoholic beverage you enjoy on a lazy summer day may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Why? Because alcohol is metabolized by the liver and any drug that affects the liver may also affect the way the pill is absorbed by the body.  “This is especially true for heavy drinkers,” Comrie said. “Once you take something that affects the liver, you weaken the effects of the pill.”  4.) Antibiotics/seizure medication . Neurological medication, especially seizure medication, like Dilantin and carbamazepine, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill, said Dr. Jacques Moritz, director of gynecology at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.  “Antibiotics are also a problem,” he said, “but more of a problem because the pill is now so low dose.”  But Comrie said antibiotics aren’t as big of a concern as they once were.  “There have been studies that show that although antibiotics affect the excretion of (the pill), the blood levels are not affected,” she said. “So this is almost becoming a myth.”  5.) Taking a generic form of the pill . Generic pills may save money, but "they do not contain the same amount of medicine as their name-brand counterparts," Moritz said.  “The FDA allows for a 15 percent variation in generic medications,” he said. “Again this is a concern because the pills are now so low dose. So women should be especially cautious and use a back-up, such as a condom, if they are put on any medication that may interfere with the pill.”          Advertisement           Advertisement                     Site Index    Sections   Home  Video  Politics  U.S.  Opinion  Entertainment  Tech  Science  Health  Travel  Lifestyle  World  Sports  Weather  On Air     Tools   Live Video  Trending  Newsletters  Alerts  Podcasts  Radio  Apps & Products     About   Careers  College Students  Fox Around the World  Advertise With Us  New Terms of Use  (What's New)  New Privacy Policy  Ad Choices  Help  Email Newsroom  Media Relations  Closed Captioning Policy     Follow   Facebook  Twitter  Google+  Instagram  RSS  Newsletters      Fox News  Back to Top   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

I think there is no reason to be worried... am I wrong? What can I say to her?  — Lover      Dear Lover,  You're on the right track, however your partner's concerns are normal. When the pill is used correctly, the chance of pregnancy is pretty slim. Still, any possibility of parenthood, however small, may be worrisome to your partner. Talking about her concerns and considering a back-up method like condoms may ease her fears and make sex more fun for both of you.  In the heat of the moment, it's easy to sweep any uncertainty about sex under the rug. To better understand where your partner is coming from (no pun intended!), you may want to talk with her about why ejaculation makes her uneasy. For example, is she mainly worried about getting pregnant or is something else troubling her, like concern about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or a reaction to semen (regarding the latter, check out Allergic to semen? in the Go Ask Alice! archives)? Once you're both on the same page, you can discuss ways to address her concern about your fireworks.  If pregnancy is the primary concern, the pill's low failure rate may provide reassurance. With "perfect use" of combined pills (the most common form pills that contain progestin and estrogen), one out of 1,000 women will become pregnant. The failure rate is slightly higher for the minipill (progestin only) with five out of 1,000 women getting pregnant. "Perfect use" means taking the pill at the same time every day, without skipping a dose. Setting an alarm on a watch or cell phone may help your partner remember to take her pill on schedule. For more information about the pill's effectiveness, visit Planned Parenthood .  A second birth control method would provide extra pregnancy protection — a good idea if your partner just started the pill or if she takes a medication that could make it less effective. As a back up, you might consider condoms, spermicidal foam, the sponge, or a diaphragm.  Condoms have the added benefit of guarding against STIs, including HIV. Some couples also like using condoms for visual proof that sperm stays in the bag, and out of the vagina. A back-up method may provide emotional reassurance so pregnancy is less of a worry.  If you haven't already, you and she may want to discuss your contraceptive options with a health care provider who can help you decide which method is right for both of you.  The pill is an effective form of birth control, but if your partner isn't totally comfortable, a back up method is a reasonable plan. Talking openly about safer sex precautions may ease her concerns and help both of you get off on the right foot!  Alice!

Some contain a hormone called progestin. Others contain two hormones, progestin and estrogen. All of them work by doing two things: They prevent women from ovulating, and they cause the cervical mucus to thicken, which makes it more difficult for a sperm to penetrate and make contact with an egg if the woman is ovulating.  In a way, birth control mimics the body's response to pregnancy. "There is some truth to the idea that birth control pills trick your body into thinking you're pregnant," said Dr. Vanessa Cullins, Planned Parenthood's vice president of external medical affairs. "When you're pregnant, you don't ovulate, and the cervical mucus is thickening to prevent anything from easily getting into your uterus."  2) Lots of women take birth control incorrectly  If women follow the exact instructions for taking birth control pills — every day, at the same time — they prevent pregnancy in 99 percent of all cases. But lots of people don't do that. In real life, birth control pills have a 9 percent failure rate. That means nine of every 100 women using birth control pills as their only means of contraception become pregnant in any given year.  "It's hard to actually [take the pill at the same time every day] when you're living a busy life," Cullins says. "If you take these pills every single day, the chances of getting pregnant is 1 percent. But typically the chance is much higher than that, because people miss pills. This isn't just true with birth control pills. It's true with any prescription medication."  Birth control pills have a higher failure rate than other contraceptives, like intra-uterine devices (IUDs) or birth control rings.            The main difference: Pills have to be taken every day, which leaves more room for human error.  3) There's a three-hour window for taking your birth control pill "on time"  I asked Cullins whether there is wiggle room in terms of when birth control is effective. For instance, i f a birth control user typically takes a pill at 9 am but one morning waits until 11 am, is she at greater risk for pregnancy?  The answer is no. Cullins said that for those taking progestin-only pills, "on time" means taking the pill within the same three-hour window daily. A three-hour difference is not enough to lower the pill's efficacy. "That's acceptable," she said.  For combination progestin-estrogen pills, the space is even wider. Women who miss one day of their pill can take two pills the next day without reducing their birth control's effectiveness. This chart with data from Planned Parenthood shows the organization's recommendations for how to handle a missed combination pill.            "Two or three missed pills is when you need to begin to get concerned, and once you get to three missed pills, you need to consider emergency contraception and using backup birth control until she has finished the first week of the pills of the new package that is begun after her bleed from emergency contraception," Cullins said.  4) Missing a period on the pill doesn't mean something's wrong  Missing a period while on the pill doesn't indicate anything abnormal, Cullins said, as long as you have been taking the pill consistently and correctly each day.  "It's not dangerous not to have your period while on the pill," she says. "What happens is, over time, the uterine lining can become very thin if you take the pill regularly. All that means is if you stop bleeding on the pill, the lining has become so thin that you don't have anything to bleed from."  This is not permanent: When a woman stops taking birth control pills, the ovaries start making more estrogen, the uterine lining gets thicker, and women start to bleed again.  Missed periods after taking your pills incorrectly, however, could indicate a pregnancy. In that situation, it's worth taking a pregnancy test.  5) We don't know whether most antibiotics make birth control less effective  There are two antibiotics that researchers have found make birth control pills less effective: griseofulvin, an antifungal used to treat athlete's foot and ringworm, and rifampicin, which is typically used to treat tuberculosis.  The reason that happens is that these drugs speed up the liver's metabolism, which makes the liver metabolize the hormones in the birth control faster. As a result, hormones leave the blood stream faster and are unable to adequately affect the ovaries to prevent ovulation or the cervix to prevent thickening of the cervical mucus.  Lots of antibiotics, not just the two listed above, come with warnings that they'll make birth control ineffective and suggest using a backup method of contraception. While a backup method is never a bad idea, there's actually sparse evidence that these other drugs make birth control less effective. "Uncertainty persists with respect to the other broad-spectrum antibiotics," researchers in the journal Contraception  wrote in a review article about interactions between birth control and antibiotics. They argue that in light of that uncertainty, it is completely appropriate for women to use a backup method — but not to ditch their antibiotics out of concern over interactions.  6) Those "sugar pills" at the end of a birth control pack? They have active ingredients.  Lots of birth control packs have four weeks of pills: three weeks of pills that prevent pregnancy and one week of pills that are inactive.  Women can safely skip that last week of pills and still prevent pregnancy, Cullins said. But that doesn't mean the last week's pills are just sugar pills. As it turns out, some of them actually have active ingredients to make the pills work better or aid in women's health.  "Some of the pills might have low-dose estrogen for three to four days, to help prevent breakthrough bleeding [bleeding in the middle of a cycle]," she said. "Others sometimes contain iron or folic acid or other vitamins. And the hard part about skipping the pills is that you have to remember exactly when to start back up."  7) Even under Obamacare, not everyone with insurance gets free birth control  The number of women getting free birth control pills has quadrupled under Obamacare, recent research shows . Two-thirds of women in a recent Guttmacher Institute survey reported paying zero dollars for their contraceptive.            But that still leaves one-third of women paying something for birth control, even after Obamacare has mandated it be free.  The one-third of women still paying for their birth control are most likely in grandfathered health insurance plans. These are the plans that existed before Obamacare that do not have to comply with the contraceptives mandate (or most other Obamacare requirements, for that matter).  Grandfathered plans are, however, disappearing. When a company significantly changes its insurance (drops a benefit, for example, or changes what enrollees have to pay), then it loses its grandfathered status. Just over a quarter of health insurance plans are currently grandfathered, a number that has steadily dropped since Obamacare passed.  As that figure declines, the number of women accessing no-cost contraceptives will likely continue growing.

Just ask my mom, who was "pleasantly surprised" by the discovery of my conception because she was using them at the time. Was she using them correctly? I don't know. She thought she was; I do know that. This is why it's important to know what behaviors and situations decrease its efficacy so you don't get pregnant while on the pill . This isn't fear-mongering meant to make you distrust contraception, but rather, some information that you can use to keep your baby box on lockdown. It's good stuff to learn and to share with your friends, because if your birth control game isn't strong, the consequences are quite literally life changing. Even with perfect use, one out of 100 women will become pregnant while using the pill , according to Planned Parenthood. Actually, Planned Parenthood says that less than one woman will become pregnant, but because there are no fractional women, and because claiming 100 percent efficacy can be dangerous, they must only claim that it works to prevent pregnancy more than 99 percent of the time. As a Planned Parenthood clinic manager with a Responsible Sexuality Educator certificate, I know that the odds of you becoming pregnant with perfect use are so small that you can feel confident taking it — as long as you know what to do should one of the following situations occur. 1. You Threw Up If you throw up within two hours of taking your birth control pill , no matter what kind of pill you're on, you have to kiss that pill goodbye. The same goes for diarrhea that lasts more than 24 hours , according to Baby Center. If you didn't know that and didn't follow your pill's instructions for a single missed dose, you're probably fine, but if you missed two or more pills in a row, you could definitely become pregnant. 2. You Took Certain Medications Rifampin is the only antibiotic you have to worry about when you're on the pill, according to the Mayo Clinic, and it's kind of rarely prescribed nowadays. If you took other types of antibiotics, you're fine. There are other medications used for fungal infections, HIV, and seizures that can make your birth control less effective , so always ask your doctor about birth control combined with any medication you're taking. 3. You Left Your Pills In Your Car Or maybe your keep them in your purse or in the bathroom. This is not a great idea. Birth control pills need to be stored in temperatures less than 77 degrees or they start to degrade, according to BabyMed. If you're not sure, use a backup method, such as condoms, until you start a new, properly stored pack. 4. You Took St. John's Wort The National Institutes of Health warns against taking St. John's Wort if you take birth control that contains estrogen. St. John's Wort is a popular herbal depression remedy that interferes with the way your body breaks down estrogen. 5. You Can't Remember If You Took It Imperfect use, or not taking your birth control when and how your're supposed to, is the number one reason it fails , according to Planned Parenthood. You don't have to take it with scientific precision, but you do need to take it around the same time every day, especially if you're taking progestin-only pills, or you could become pregnant. When in doubt, Planned Parenthood recommends using condoms for seven days after a missed pill, just in case. 6. You Just Started Taking The Pill If you start taking the pill right after your period ends, you're good to go. If you start your pill on a random day in the middle of the month, you need to use a backup for the first seven days , according to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, or you could become pregnant .

Millions of women take it with confidenceand rightly so.  But to be fully effective, birth control pills need to be taken correctly. Missing even a few doses greatly increases your chances of pregnancy: while only 0.1 percent of women get pregnant when using the pill properly, pregnancy rates soar by 30-80 times when pills are missed.  This information can help you setand stick toa routine thats right for you.   Skipping Pills Greatly Increases the Chance of Pregnancy    Your life. Your routine.   Given how important it is to take your pills regularly, its essential that you establish a routine that works for you. Does it fit your schedule? Are you more likely to remember your pill in the morning or at night? How will you remind yourself? Its best if you take your pill at the same time every day. Try to make it part of something your do already, like taking vitamins in the morning or brushing your teeth before bed. If that doesnt suit you, how about right after dinner or with your first cup of coffee? Be it morning, noon or night, taking your pills at a consistent time is the quickest way to develop a new routine. Three more good ideas:  Pack your pills. Even if you take them at home or work, carry your pills with you at all times. That way, youll have them on hand if youre suddenly called away or realize that you forgot to take one. Mark your calendar. Try to pick up your pill packs on the same day every month, and then mark your calendar. Many women pick up their packs every two months, on the first day of the month. The 3-month rule. If youre new to the pill, be sure to call or visit your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider after three months for a quick checkup. Its a great chance to discuss your experience and any questions you might have. Find the routine thats right for you. And stick with it!   If you miss a pill...   Never skip a pill on purposeeven if you bleed between periods, miss a period, get headaches or feel queasy. All of these are normal side effects which some women experience and which usually disappear after three menstrual cycles. (If youre concerned, or the symptoms are severe, call your health care provider.) As for skipping a pill by accident... We all slip up now and then, and its likely that youll eventually forget to take a pill. If you miss just one, dont worrytake it as soon as you remember and take the next pill at your regular time.*  If you miss two or more pills, you must do two things:  Call your doctor. Different pills have different instructions for missed doses. Your health care provider can tell you what to do to get back on track. Use a back-up. Because of the missed pills, you have a much greater chance of getting pregnant. So even though youre back on schedule, you also need to use a back-up method of contraception  like a condom, or spermicide  for the rest of your cycle.  Also use a back up method when:      A note about STIs Keep in mind that the pill only help prevent pregnancy. It does not protect you from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papillomavirus (which causes genital warts), syphilis and genital herpesall of which can harm your health and hurt your chances of getting pregnant later on. If youre concerned about STIs, be sure sure you or your partner use a latex condom every time. Your cycle requires it. If your period begins on a day other than Sunday just before you begin taking a Sunday-start pill, you should use a back-up method for the next seven days. You are vomiting or have diarrhea. They can interfere with your bodys absorption of the pill, and raise your chance of pregnancy. Us a back-up for the rest your cycle. *Note: If youre on a 28-day pill program, and you forget to take one or two of your reminder pills (the last seven in the pack), dont worry. Throw away the ones you missed and keep taking one a day until the pack is empty.  REMEMBER: MISS ONE, MAKE IT UP. MISS TWO, BACK IT UP.

Privacy Statement | Terms & Conditions          Newsletter Is There a Chance of Getting Pregnant While Taking Birth Control? Medically reviewed by Nicole Galan, RN on  February 2, 2016 — Written by Kimberly Holland Pregnancy signs and symptoms Causes aside from pregnancy If you think you’re pregnant Pregnancy prevention Overview  Birth control is 99 percent effective when it’s used perfectly. “Perfect use” means that it’s taken at the same time every day without any exceptions. “Typical use” refers to how it’s most commonly used. This accounts for taking the pill at slightly different times or accidently missing a day. With typical use, birth control is about 91 percent effective.  Despite these high percentages, it’s still possible for you to get pregnant. Birth control failure is often the result of missing two or more pills in a row. Without the constant supply of hormones, you may begin ovulating . If you have unprotected sex during this time, your chances of becoming pregnant increase.  Keep reading to learn whether the symptoms you’re experiencing are signs of pregnancy or just side effects of your birth control.  Pregnancy signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms
of pregnancy  The earliest signs of pregnancy share many of the same characteristics as the side effects of the birth control pill. This may include:  A missed period  Birth control can make your period very light . This light bleeding can be confused with implantation bleeding , which occurs when a fertilized egg implants into the uterus . It can also cause you to have breakthrough bleeding, which is bleeding between periods . Birth control can even cause you to miss a period , which can be confused with a sign of pregnancy.  Nausea  Morning sickness , which can happen at any time of the day, can indicate that you’re pregnant. Birth control pills can also cause nausea . If taking your pill with food doesn’t help alleviate the nausea, you may want to take a pregnancy test.  Breast tenderness  As your pregnancy continues, your breasts may become tender to the touch. Hormonal birth control pills can also cause breast tenderness .  Fatigue and headaches  Fatigue is a common symptom of pregnancy. Altered hormonal levels from birth control pills can also cause excessive tiredness and headaches .  Causes aside from pregnancy What else can cause
these symptoms?  In addition to possible pregnancy and birth control side effects, there are a few other conditions that may explain some of the symptoms you’re experiencing. These can include:  Sexually transmitted infections  Although  birth control prevents pregnancy in most cases, it doesn’t protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Some STIs can cause cramping, bleeding, and nausea.  Cancer  Certain cancers , including cervical or endometrial cancer, can cause symptoms that could be confused with pregnancy or birth control side effects.  These symptoms include:  bleeding cramping nausea pain fatigue  Fibroids or cysts  Fibroids and cysts are unusual growths that can develop on a woman’s uterus or ovaries . Most people with either of the conditions experience unusual bleeding, which is often very heavy. Still, it’s possible some of the other symptoms, such as nausea, pain, and increased urination could be present before any bleeding begins.  Risks of taking birth control while pregnant  If you were taking birth control to prevent pregnancy but find out weeks later that you’re indeed pregnant, it’s natural to wonder what effect your birth control may have on a developing fetus . The good news is that birth control has been shown to be safe in early pregnancy.  Of course, no guarantee can be made that the medication hasn’t affected the baby’s development , so be sure to see your doctor as soon as you suspect or find out that you’re pregnant. If you test positive, you should stop taking your birth control pill.  Becoming pregnant while on birth control does increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy . An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized embryo attaches outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube . This is a very serious, life-threatening problem and should be cared for immediately.  If you think you’re pregnant What to do if you
think you’re pregnant  If you think you may be pregnant, find out as soon as you can so you can begin prenatal care . Over-the-counter pregnancy tests are extremely accurate. There are many options available on Amazon.com. Take more than one if you want. You can even ask your doctor’s office for an at-home test.  Alternatively, make an appointment to see your doctor to discuss the symptoms you’re experiencing. As part of the routine checkup , your doctor will likely conduct a pregnancy test. You can request one, too. By the end of the appointment, you’ll know if you’re expecting or not. Take this quiz to see whether you might have the symptoms of pregnancy.  Pregnancy prevention Preventing an
unplanned pregnancy  With typical use, birth control pills are still a highly effective form of pregnancy prevention. You can actually make it more effective by following a few simple strategies:  Get on a routine  Take the pill every day at the same time. Doing this maintains your hormone levels and decreases the risk of ovulation.  Don’t skip placebo pills  Even though placebo pills contain no active ingredients, you should still take them. Skipping those pills may interrupt your routine. You may not begin your next pack on time, and this can increase your chances of ovulation.  Limit alcohol intake  Alcohol can affect the way your liver metabolizes your medication. This can reduce its effectiveness.  Use backup protection  In certain circumstances, it will be important for you to use a barrier method or another form of birth control . Some medications may reduce your pill’s effectiveness. You should use another form of protection for a least one month after finishing any additional medicines.  Consider emergency birth control  If you have unprotected sex and then realize you skipped a pill or two, you can take emergency birth control, such as Plan B . You can take this for up to five days after you’ve had unprotected intercourse. The sooner you take it, the more effective it will be. Call your doctor if you have questions about this type of birth control.  Healthline and our partners may receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link above.

Sign up now        Do birth control pills cause birth defects if taken during early pregnancy? Answers from Yvonne Butler Tobah, M.D.    Taking birth control pills during early pregnancy doesn't appear to increase the risk of birth defects.  While some research has suggested a link between the use of birth control pills near conception and an increased risk of low birth weight, preterm birth or congenital urinary tract abnormalities, these concerns generally haven't been observed in clinical experience.  Birth control pills overall lower the risk of pregnancy and the risk of a fertilized egg implanting outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), which most often occurs in one of the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). However, if you do conceive while taking a progestin-only birth control (minipill), there's a slightly higher chance that the pregnancy will be ectopic.  As a precaution, if you suspect you're pregnant, take a home pregnancy test. If the home pregnancy test is positive, stop taking the pill. If taking a home pregnancy test isn't possible, stop taking the birth control pill until the pregnancy is confirmed or ruled out. In the meantime, use another method of birth control — such as condoms.  If you're concerned because you took birth control pills before you knew you were pregnant, talk to your health care provider, but be assured that there's little risk.

Medically reviewed by Michael Weber, MD on  October 18, 2016 — Written by Jessica Timmons Effectiveness Causes Prevention Pregnancy symptoms Pregnancy Next steps Intro  Yes. Although birth control pills have a high success rate, they can fail and you can get pregnant while on the pill. Certain factors increase your risk of getting pregnant, even if you’re on birth control. Keep these factors in mind if you’re sexually active and want to prevent an unplanned pregnancy.  Effectiveness Success and
failure rates of birth control pills  Birth control pills are 99 percent effective with “perfect use,” which means taking the pill at the same time every day without missing a dose. “Typical use” is how most women take the pill, and then it’s about 91 percent effective. Both combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only pills (also known as the mini pill) have a typical failure rate of 9 percent.  Many women accidentally miss a dose or forget to start a new pack of pills. When that happens, the chances for an accidental pregnancy go up.  The Pregnancy Quiz: Am I Pregnant? »  Causes What causes birth
control to fail  Certain conditions or behaviors can increase the likelihood that your birth control won’t be as effective at preventing pregnancy.  If you can’t remember to take your pill at the same time every day, you increase your risk of pregnancy. Birth control pills are designed to maintain a constant level of hormones in your body. If you skip or miss a dose, you hormone levels can drop quickly. Depending on where you are in your cycle, this may cause you to ovulate . Ovulation can increase your chances of becoming pregnant.  Reckless alcohol consumption can also cause birth control failure. While under the influence, some women may forget to take their pill at the correct time. If you vomit too soon after taking your pill, your body may not be able to absorb any of the hormones. This can result in a drop in your hormone levels, which could trigger ovulation.  Taking another medication or supplement at the same time as your birth control pill can also affect the pill’s effectiveness.  Prevention How to prevent birth
control failure  Keep these tips in mind if you’re on birth control and want to prevent pregnancy.  Time it right  Make sure you take your birth control pill at the same time every day. Set a reminder on your phone or watch if you need to. You may also consider taking the pill with a specific daily activity, such as during lunch or dinner.  If you take progestin-only pills, you should be especially careful about taking the pill at the same time every day. If you’re late with a dose or skip one altogether, your hormone levels can drop very quickly. This could cause you to ovulate and that greatly increases your chances for getting pregnant.  If you miss a dose, use a backup method or avoid sex for the next week. To be extra cautious, use a backup method, such as a condom , or avoid sex for the next month.  Take the placebo pills  Combination pill packs typically contain three weeks of active pills that contain hormones and one week of inactive, or placebo, pills. Although it isn’t medically necessary to take the placebo pills, doing so can help you stay in your routine.  If you choose to skip the placebo pills, there’s a chance that you may be late in starting your next pill pack. This can interrupt your body’s expected level of hormones and cause you to ovulate. Ovulation increases your chances of being pregnant.  Don’t mix medications  Some prescription and over-the-counter medications may interfere with your birth control’s effectiveness. Before you begin taking a new medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should use a backup method of protection while taking this new medication.  Although some antibiotics have been anecdotally connected to unplanned pregnancies, research has largely debunked this connection. A possible connection with reduced birth control effectiveness is only recognized with one type of uncommon antibiotic called rifampin .  Don’t use St. John’s wort  St. John’s wort is a popular over-the-counter herbal supplement that can affect liver metabolism. This supplement can interfere with birth control’s effectiveness. You could experience breakthrough bleeding and possibly an unplanned pregnancy if you take the two medicines together. Talk with your doctor about any additional measures you should take, including a backup protection method while you’re taking St. John’s wort.  Knowing what can make your birth control ineffective and how you can increase your chances for successfully avoiding pregnancy will help you make the best decisions for yourself.  Pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of pregnancy  The earliest symptoms of pregnancy can be easily overlooked, especially if you’re on birth control. If you experience any of these symptoms, take a pregnancy test to confirm your pregnancy status. If you want to double check the at-home pregnancy test, a simple blood test by your doctor can confirm your status.  The early signs of pregnancy include:  tender or swollen breasts (hormonal changes can affect the way your breasts feel) a sudden aversion to certain foods or scents unusual food cravings  Morning sickness  Nausea, vomiting, and fatigue are also signs of early pregnancy. Contrary to its name, morning sickness can occur at any time of the day. It can begin very early after conception. While your body adjusts to the new pregnancy, you may also find yourself growing tired more easily or more quickly.  Missed period  Many women begin suspecting they’re pregnant when they miss a period . Unfortunately, some women don’t have a period while on birth control, so a missed period may not necessarily be an easy indicator.  Implementation bleeding , which happens when a fertilized egg attaches to your uterus, can be mistaken for a period. This is especially true if your period is typically very light.  Pregnancy What to do if you're pregnant  If you discover that you’re pregnant , you should speak with your doctor as soon as possible. If you plan to keep the pregnancy, you’ll need to start caring for your growing baby. This means going off of the birth control pill and beginning to take a daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. You’ll also have to begin preparing for an upcoming delivery.  If you decide you’d like to terminate the pregnancy, you should begin this process as quickly as you can. Depending on where you live, legal restrictions could prevent you from having the procedure after you’ve reached a certain point in the pregnancy.  Can birth control harm your baby?  You may also worry that taking birth control pills could have harmed your developing baby. According to the Mayo Clinic , this doesn’t appear to the case. Some research showed a link between birth control during early pregnancy with issues low birth weight, abnormalities to the urinary tract, and preterm delivery, but little has been observed clinically. It’s important to stop taking the pill as soon as you suspect pregnancy, but your baby shouldn’t be at a greater risk of defects.  Next steps Next steps  If it’s taken correctly, birth control is a wonderful method for preventing pregnancy and helping with a number of other conditions, including acne and painful menstrual cramps. As with any medicine, taking it the way it’s designed to be taken is of utmost importance. If you don’t, you could end up becoming pregnant.  Knowing what can make your birth control ineffective and how you can increase your chances of successfully avoiding pregnancy will help you make the best decisions for you and your lifestyle.

Although birth control pills have a high success rate, they can fail and you can get pregnant while on the pill. Certain factors increase your risk of getting pregnant, even if you’re on birth control. Keep these factors in mind if you’re sexually active and want to prevent an unplanned pregnancy.  Effectiveness Success and
failure rates of birth control pills  Birth control pills are 99 percent effective with “perfect use,” which means taking the pill at the same time every day without missing a dose. “Typical use” is how most women take the pill, and then it’s about 91 percent effective.

control to fail  Certain conditions or behaviors can increase the likelihood that your birth control won’t be as effective at preventing pregnancy.  If you can’t remember to take your pill at the same time every day, you increase your risk of pregnancy. Birth control pills are designed to maintain a constant level of hormones in your body. If you skip or miss a dose, you hormone levels can drop quickly. Depending on where you are in your cycle, this may cause you to ovulate . Ovulation can increase your chances of becoming pregnant.  Reckless alcohol consumption can also cause birth control failure. While under the influence, some women may forget to take their pill at the correct time. If you vomit too soon after taking your pill, your body may not be able to absorb any of the hormones. This can result in a drop in your hormone levels, which could trigger ovulation.  Taking another medication or supplement at the same time as your birth control pill can also affect the pill’s effectiveness.  Prevention How to prevent birth
control failure  Keep these tips in mind if you’re on birth control and want to prevent pregnancy.  Time it right  Make sure you take your birth control pill at the same time every day. Set a reminder on your phone or watch if you need to. You may also consider taking the pill with a specific daily activity, such as during lunch or dinner.  If you take progestin-only pills, you should be especially careful about taking the pill at the same time every day. If you’re late with a dose or skip one altogether, your hormone levels can drop very quickly. This could cause you to ovulate and that greatly increases your chances for getting pregnant.  If you miss a dose, use a backup method or avoid sex for the next week. To be extra cautious, use a backup method, such as a condom , or avoid sex for the next month.  Take the placebo pills  Combination pill packs typically contain three weeks of active pills that contain hormones and one week of inactive, or placebo, pills.

If you choose to skip the placebo pills, there’s a chance that you may be late in starting your next pill pack. This can interrupt your body’s expected level of hormones and cause you to ovulate. Ovulation increases your chances of being pregnant.  Don’t mix medications  Some prescription and over-the-counter medications may interfere with your birth control’s effectiveness. Before you begin taking a new medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should use a backup method of protection while taking this new medication.  Although some antibiotics have been anecdotally connected to unplanned pregnancies, research has largely debunked this connection.

Are you more likely to remember your pill in the morning or at night? How will you remind yourself? Its best if you take your pill at the same time every day. Try to make it part of something your do already, like taking vitamins in the morning or brushing your teeth before bed. If that doesnt suit you, how about right after dinner or with your first cup of coffee? Be it morning, noon or night, taking your pills at a consistent time is the quickest way to develop a new routine. Three more good ideas:  Pack your pills. Even if you take them at home or work, carry your pills with you at all times. That way, youll have them on hand if youre suddenly called away or realize that you forgot to take one. Mark your calendar. Try to pick up your pill packs on the same day every month, and then mark your calendar. Many women pick up their packs every two months, on the first day of the month. The 3-month rule. If youre new to the pill, be sure to call or visit your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider after three months for a quick checkup. Its a great chance to discuss your experience and any questions you might have. Find the routine thats right for you. And stick with it!   If you miss a pill...   Never skip a pill on purposeeven if you bleed between periods, miss a period, get headaches or feel queasy. All of these are normal side effects which some women experience and which usually disappear after three menstrual cycles. (If youre concerned, or the symptoms are severe, call your health care provider.) As for skipping a pill by accident... We all slip up now and then, and its likely that youll eventually forget to take a pill. If you miss just one, dont worrytake it as soon as you remember and take the next pill at your regular time.*  If you miss two or more pills, you must do two things:  Call your doctor. Different pills have different instructions for missed doses. Your health care provider can tell you what to do to get back on track. Use a back-up. Because of the missed pills, you have a much greater chance of getting pregnant. So even though youre back on schedule, you also need to use a back-up method of contraception  like a condom, or spermicide  for the rest of your cycle.  Also use a back up method when:      A note about STIs Keep in mind that the pill only help prevent pregnancy. It does not protect you from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papillomavirus (which causes genital warts), syphilis and genital herpesall of which can harm your health and hurt your chances of getting pregnant later on. If youre concerned about STIs, be sure sure you or your partner use a latex condom every time. Your cycle requires it. If your period begins on a day other than Sunday just before you begin taking a Sunday-start pill, you should use a back-up method for the next seven days. You are vomiting or have diarrhea. They can interfere with your bodys absorption of the pill, and raise your chance of pregnancy. Us a back-up for the rest your cycle. *Note: If youre on a 28-day pill program, and you forget to take one or two of your reminder pills (the last seven in the pack), dont worry. Throw away the ones you missed and keep taking one a day until the pack is empty.  REMEMBER: MISS ONE, MAKE IT UP. MISS TWO, BACK IT UP.

		            June 16, 2008   Fox News       Facebook 0  Twitter 0  Email  Print      More than 12 million U.S. women use the combined oral contraceptive pill, more commonly referred to as the pill.  The pill is 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. Even so, between 2 and 8 percent of women become pregnant each year while using it.  And doctors say it’s not the pill that’s failing women, but women failing the pill.  Click here to discuss this story.  “The biggest thing that we know of, that affects the efficacy of the pill, is misuse by patients who do not follow the program as prescribed,” said Dr. Millicent Comrie, founder and director of the Long Island College Hospital Center for Women’s Health and vice chairman of the college’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Here are five things that may cause the pill to become less effective or even fail:  1.) Not taking the pill at the same time every day . Because of health concerns, the level of estrogen in birth control pills has been significantly decreased since it was first introduced in the U.S. in 1960. Modern pills, often referred to as “low-dose” pills, contain about 20 micrograms of estrogen, which is less than half the 50 micrograms pills once contained. Because of this, it’s more important than ever that woman take their pills everyday at the same time, said Comrie.  2.) Missing a dose . Worse than not taking the pill at the same time every day is missing a day, said Comrie.  “Once you miss one pill, you should double up,” Comrie said. “And if you have any kind of breakthrough bleeding, you should use a condom. With the lose-dose pills, you have to be very careful when you miss a dose.”  3.) Alcohol . That’s right, that glass of wine with dinner or that fruity alcoholic beverage you enjoy on a lazy summer day may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Why? Because alcohol is metabolized by the liver and any drug that affects the liver may also affect the way the pill is absorbed by the body.  “This is especially true for heavy drinkers,” Comrie said. “Once you take something that affects the liver, you weaken the effects of the pill.”  4.) Antibiotics/seizure medication . Neurological medication, especially seizure medication, like Dilantin and carbamazepine, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill, said Dr. Jacques Moritz, director of gynecology at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.  “Antibiotics are also a problem,” he said, “but more of a problem because the pill is now so low dose.”  But Comrie said antibiotics aren’t as big of a concern as they once were.  “There have been studies that show that although antibiotics affect the excretion of (the pill), the blood levels are not affected,” she said. “So this is almost becoming a myth.”  5.) Taking a generic form of the pill . Generic pills may save money, but "they do not contain the same amount of medicine as their name-brand counterparts," Moritz said.  “The FDA allows for a 15 percent variation in generic medications,” he said. “Again this is a concern because the pills are now so low dose. So women should be especially cautious and use a back-up, such as a condom, if they are put on any medication that may interfere with the pill.”          Advertisement           Advertisement                     Site Index    Sections   Home  Video  Politics  U.S.  Opinion  Entertainment  Tech  Science  Health  Travel  Lifestyle  World  Sports  Weather  On Air     Tools   Live Video  Trending  Newsletters  Alerts  Podcasts  Radio  Apps & Products     About   Careers  College Students  Fox Around the World  Advertise With Us  New Terms of Use  (What's New)  New Privacy Policy  Ad Choices  Help  Email Newsroom  Media Relations  Closed Captioning Policy     Follow   Facebook  Twitter  Google+  Instagram  RSS  Newsletters      Fox News  Back to Top   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

I think there is no reason to be worried... am I wrong? What can I say to her?  — Lover      Dear Lover,  You're on the right track, however your partner's concerns are normal. When the pill is used correctly, the chance of pregnancy is pretty slim. Still, any possibility of parenthood, however small, may be worrisome to your partner. Talking about her concerns and considering a back-up method like condoms may ease her fears and make sex more fun for both of you.  In the heat of the moment, it's easy to sweep any uncertainty about sex under the rug. To better understand where your partner is coming from (no pun intended!), you may want to talk with her about why ejaculation makes her uneasy. For example, is she mainly worried about getting pregnant or is something else troubling her, like concern about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or a reaction to semen (regarding the latter, check out Allergic to semen? in the Go Ask Alice! archives)? Once you're both on the same page, you can discuss ways to address her concern about your fireworks.  If pregnancy is the primary concern, the pill's low failure rate may provide reassurance. With "perfect use" of combined pills (the most common form pills that contain progestin and estrogen), one out of 1,000 women will become pregnant. The failure rate is slightly higher for the minipill (progestin only) with five out of 1,000 women getting pregnant. "Perfect use" means taking the pill at the same time every day, without skipping a dose. Setting an alarm on a watch or cell phone may help your partner remember to take her pill on schedule. For more information about the pill's effectiveness, visit Planned Parenthood .  A second birth control method would provide extra pregnancy protection — a good idea if your partner just started the pill or if she takes a medication that could make it less effective. As a back up, you might consider condoms, spermicidal foam, the sponge, or a diaphragm.  Condoms have the added benefit of guarding against STIs, including HIV. Some couples also like using condoms for visual proof that sperm stays in the bag, and out of the vagina. A back-up method may provide emotional reassurance so pregnancy is less of a worry.  If you haven't already, you and she may want to discuss your contraceptive options with a health care provider who can help you decide which method is right for both of you.  The pill is an effective form of birth control, but if your partner isn't totally comfortable, a back up method is a reasonable plan. Talking openly about safer sex precautions may ease her concerns and help both of you get off on the right foot!  Alice!

Some contain a hormone called progestin. Others contain two hormones, progestin and estrogen. All of them work by doing two things: They prevent women from ovulating, and they cause the cervical mucus to thicken, which makes it more difficult for a sperm to penetrate and make contact with an egg if the woman is ovulating.  In a way, birth control mimics the body's response to pregnancy. "There is some truth to the idea that birth control pills trick your body into thinking you're pregnant," said Dr. Vanessa Cullins, Planned Parenthood's vice president of external medical affairs. "When you're pregnant, you don't ovulate, and the cervical mucus is thickening to prevent anything from easily getting into your uterus."  2) Lots of women take birth control incorrectly  If women follow the exact instructions for taking birth control pills — every day, at the same time — they prevent pregnancy in 99 percent of all cases. But lots of people don't do that. In real life, birth control pills have a 9 percent failure rate. That means nine of every 100 women using birth control pills as their only means of contraception become pregnant in any given year.  "It's hard to actually [take the pill at the same time every day] when you're living a busy life," Cullins says. "If you take these pills every single day, the chances of getting pregnant is 1 percent. But typically the chance is much higher than that, because people miss pills. This isn't just true with birth control pills. It's true with any prescription medication."  Birth control pills have a higher failure rate than other contraceptives, like intra-uterine devices (IUDs) or birth control rings.            The main difference: Pills have to be taken every day, which leaves more room for human error.  3) There's a three-hour window for taking your birth control pill "on time"  I asked Cullins whether there is wiggle room in terms of when birth control is effective. For instance, i f a birth control user typically takes a pill at 9 am but one morning waits until 11 am, is she at greater risk for pregnancy?  The answer is no. Cullins said that for those taking progestin-only pills, "on time" means taking the pill within the same three-hour window daily. A three-hour difference is not enough to lower the pill's efficacy. "That's acceptable," she said.  For combination progestin-estrogen pills, the space is even wider. Women who miss one day of their pill can take two pills the next day without reducing their birth control's effectiveness. This chart with data from Planned Parenthood shows the organization's recommendations for how to handle a missed combination pill.            "Two or three missed pills is when you need to begin to get concerned, and once you get to three missed pills, you need to consider emergency contraception and using backup birth control until she has finished the first week of the pills of the new package that is begun after her bleed from emergency contraception," Cullins said.  4) Missing a period on the pill doesn't mean something's wrong  Missing a period while on the pill doesn't indicate anything abnormal, Cullins said, as long as you have been taking the pill consistently and correctly each day.  "It's not dangerous not to have your period while on the pill," she says. "What happens is, over time, the uterine lining can become very thin if you take the pill regularly. All that means is if you stop bleeding on the pill, the lining has become so thin that you don't have anything to bleed from."  This is not permanent: When a woman stops taking birth control pills, the ovaries start making more estrogen, the uterine lining gets thicker, and women start to bleed again.  Missed periods after taking your pills incorrectly, however, could indicate a pregnancy. In that situation, it's worth taking a pregnancy test.  5) We don't know whether most antibiotics make birth control less effective  There are two antibiotics that researchers have found make birth control pills less effective: griseofulvin, an antifungal used to treat athlete's foot and ringworm, and rifampicin, which is typically used to treat tuberculosis.  The reason that happens is that these drugs speed up the liver's metabolism, which makes the liver metabolize the hormones in the birth control faster. As a result, hormones leave the blood stream faster and are unable to adequately affect the ovaries to prevent ovulation or the cervix to prevent thickening of the cervical mucus.  Lots of antibiotics, not just the two listed above, come with warnings that they'll make birth control ineffective and suggest using a backup method of contraception. While a backup method is never a bad idea, there's actually sparse evidence that these other drugs make birth control less effective. "Uncertainty persists with respect to the other broad-spectrum antibiotics," researchers in the journal Contraception  wrote in a review article about interactions between birth control and antibiotics. They argue that in light of that uncertainty, it is completely appropriate for women to use a backup method — but not to ditch their antibiotics out of concern over interactions.  6) Those "sugar pills" at the end of a birth control pack? They have active ingredients.  Lots of birth control packs have four weeks of pills: three weeks of pills that prevent pregnancy and one week of pills that are inactive.  Women can safely skip that last week of pills and still prevent pregnancy, Cullins said. But that doesn't mean the last week's pills are just sugar pills. As it turns out, some of them actually have active ingredients to make the pills work better or aid in women's health.  "Some of the pills might have low-dose estrogen for three to four days, to help prevent breakthrough bleeding [bleeding in the middle of a cycle]," she said. "Others sometimes contain iron or folic acid or other vitamins. And the hard part about skipping the pills is that you have to remember exactly when to start back up."  7) Even under Obamacare, not everyone with insurance gets free birth control  The number of women getting free birth control pills has quadrupled under Obamacare, recent research shows . Two-thirds of women in a recent Guttmacher Institute survey reported paying zero dollars for their contraceptive.            But that still leaves one-third of women paying something for birth control, even after Obamacare has mandated it be free.  The one-third of women still paying for their birth control are most likely in grandfathered health insurance plans. These are the plans that existed before Obamacare that do not have to comply with the contraceptives mandate (or most other Obamacare requirements, for that matter).  Grandfathered plans are, however, disappearing. When a company significantly changes its insurance (drops a benefit, for example, or changes what enrollees have to pay), then it loses its grandfathered status. Just over a quarter of health insurance plans are currently grandfathered, a number that has steadily dropped since Obamacare passed.  As that figure declines, the number of women accessing no-cost contraceptives will likely continue growing.

Just ask my mom, who was "pleasantly surprised" by the discovery of my conception because she was using them at the time. Was she using them correctly? I don't know. She thought she was; I do know that. This is why it's important to know what behaviors and situations decrease its efficacy so you don't get pregnant while on the pill . This isn't fear-mongering meant to make you distrust contraception, but rather, some information that you can use to keep your baby box on lockdown. It's good stuff to learn and to share with your friends, because if your birth control game isn't strong, the consequences are quite literally life changing. Even with perfect use, one out of 100 women will become pregnant while using the pill , according to Planned Parenthood. Actually, Planned Parenthood says that less than one woman will become pregnant, but because there are no fractional women, and because claiming 100 percent efficacy can be dangerous, they must only claim that it works to prevent pregnancy more than 99 percent of the time. As a Planned Parenthood clinic manager with a Responsible Sexuality Educator certificate, I know that the odds of you becoming pregnant with perfect use are so small that you can feel confident taking it — as long as you know what to do should one of the following situations occur. 1. You Threw Up If you throw up within two hours of taking your birth control pill , no matter what kind of pill you're on, you have to kiss that pill goodbye. The same goes for diarrhea that lasts more than 24 hours , according to Baby Center. If you didn't know that and didn't follow your pill's instructions for a single missed dose, you're probably fine, but if you missed two or more pills in a row, you could definitely become pregnant. 2. You Took Certain Medications Rifampin is the only antibiotic you have to worry about when you're on the pill, according to the Mayo Clinic, and it's kind of rarely prescribed nowadays. If you took other types of antibiotics, you're fine. There are other medications used for fungal infections, HIV, and seizures that can make your birth control less effective , so always ask your doctor about birth control combined with any medication you're taking. 3. You Left Your Pills In Your Car Or maybe your keep them in your purse or in the bathroom. This is not a great idea. Birth control pills need to be stored in temperatures less than 77 degrees or they start to degrade, according to BabyMed. If you're not sure, use a backup method, such as condoms, until you start a new, properly stored pack. 4. You Took St. John's Wort The National Institutes of Health warns against taking St. John's Wort if you take birth control that contains estrogen. St. John's Wort is a popular herbal depression remedy that interferes with the way your body breaks down estrogen. 5. You Can't Remember If You Took It Imperfect use, or not taking your birth control when and how your're supposed to, is the number one reason it fails , according to Planned Parenthood. You don't have to take it with scientific precision, but you do need to take it around the same time every day, especially if you're taking progestin-only pills, or you could become pregnant. When in doubt, Planned Parenthood recommends using condoms for seven days after a missed pill, just in case. 6. You Just Started Taking The Pill If you start taking the pill right after your period ends, you're good to go. If you start your pill on a random day in the middle of the month, you need to use a backup for the first seven days , according to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, or you could become pregnant .

The risk of pregnancy is small when you make a mistake, but knowing when to use a backup method makes you safe rather than sorry.
