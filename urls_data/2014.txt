NB: For inclusion into this article, studies recording the rarity drops of card packs should have a reasonably large sample size and should have a citable reference from a reputable source.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.    Expansion  Cards  Card count  Percentage of total   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  61,795  44,146  14,083  2,823  743  71.44%  22.79%  4.57%  1.20%   Goblins vs Gnomes*  2,000  1,419  462  97  22  70.95%  23.10%  4.85%  1.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  54,271  17,276  3,232  766  71.84%  22.87%  4.28%  1.01%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  4,030  1,284  256  60  71.58%  22.81%  4.55%  1.07%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  4,805  1,556  299  70  71.40%  23.12%  4.44%  1.04%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  8,419  2,694  538  134  71.44%  22.86%  4.57%  1.14%   Knights of the Frozen Throne*  1,900  1,361  441  80  18  71.63%  23.21%  4.21%  0.95%   Total for all expansions   163,485  117,090  37,355  7,245  1,795  71.62%  22.85%  4.43%  1.10%  * Note that the sample size for Goblins vs Gnomes & Knights of the Frozen Throne are probably too small to be statistically relevant.  Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs. (For readability, the totals and the percentages are split over two separate tables):    Expansion  Cards  Number of regular  Number of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615  1,853  835  780  175  63   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  1,934  1,390  432  92  20  66  29  30  5  2   The Grand Tournament  75,545  73,266  53,151  16,319  3,086  710  2,279  1,120  957  146  56   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  5,443  3,939  1,209  241  54  187  91  75  15  6   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  6,502  4,694  1,464  282  62  228  111  92  17  8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  11,380  8,236  2,516  506  122  405  183  178  32  12   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  1,837  1,333  413  75  16  63  28  28  5  2   Total for all expansions   158,485  153,467  111,156  34,088  6,640  1,583  5,018  2,369  2,112  390  147    Expansion  Cards  Percentage of regular  Percentage of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  96.70%  69.50%  21.60%  4.60%  1.00%  3.30%  1.45%  1.50%  0.25%  0.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  96.98%  70.36%  21.60%  4.08%  0.94%  3.02%  1.48%  1.27%  0.19%  0.07%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  96.68%  69.96%  21.47%  4.28%  0.96%  3.32%  1.62%  1.33%  0.27%  0.11%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  96.61%  69.75%  21.75%  4.19%  0.92%  3.39%  1.65%  1.37%  0.25%  0.12%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  96.56%  69.89%  21.35%  4.29%  1.04%  3.44%  1.55%  1.51%  0.27%  0.10%   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  96.69%  70.16%  21.74%  3.95%  0.84%  3.31%  1.47%  1.47%  0.26%  0.11%   Total for all expansions   158,485  96.83%  70.14%  21.51%  4.19%  1.00%  3.17%  1.49%  1.33%  0.25%  0.09%  Disregarding the data from GvG (which is statistically irrelevant because of the small sample size), it appears that the chance of receiving a golden common card has been slightly increased as of the Old Gods expansion, while simultaneously lowering the chance of a regular common card. In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.    Expansion  Cards  Card count  Percentage of total   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  61,795  44,146  14,083  2,823  743  71.44%  22.79%  4.57%  1.20%   Goblins vs Gnomes*  2,000  1,419  462  97  22  70.95%  23.10%  4.85%  1.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  54,271  17,276  3,232  766  71.84%  22.87%  4.28%  1.01%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  4,030  1,284  256  60  71.58%  22.81%  4.55%  1.07%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  4,805  1,556  299  70  71.40%  23.12%  4.44%  1.04%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  8,419  2,694  538  134  71.44%  22.86%  4.57%  1.14%   Knights of the Frozen Throne*  1,900  1,361  441  80  18  71.63%  23.21%  4.21%  0.95%   Total for all expansions   163,485  117,090  37,355  7,245  1,795  71.62%  22.85%  4.43%  1.10%  * Note that the sample size for Goblins vs Gnomes & Knights of the Frozen Throne are probably too small to be statistically relevant.  Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs.

In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.    Expansion  Cards  Card count  Percentage of total   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  61,795  44,146  14,083  2,823  743  71.44%  22.79%  4.57%  1.20%   Goblins vs Gnomes*  2,000  1,419  462  97  22  70.95%  23.10%  4.85%  1.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  54,271  17,276  3,232  766  71.84%  22.87%  4.28%  1.01%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  4,030  1,284  256  60  71.58%  22.81%  4.55%  1.07%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  4,805  1,556  299  70  71.40%  23.12%  4.44%  1.04%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  8,419  2,694  538  134  71.44%  22.86%  4.57%  1.14%   Knights of the Frozen Throne*  1,900  1,361  441  80  18  71.63%  23.21%  4.21%  0.95%   Total for all expansions   163,485  117,090  37,355  7,245  1,795  71.62%  22.85%  4.43%  1.10%  * Note that the sample size for Goblins vs Gnomes & Knights of the Frozen Throne are probably too small to be statistically relevant.  Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs. (For readability, the totals and the percentages are split over two separate tables):    Expansion  Cards  Number of regular  Number of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615  1,853  835  780  175  63   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  1,934  1,390  432  92  20  66  29  30  5  2   The Grand Tournament  75,545  73,266  53,151  16,319  3,086  710  2,279  1,120  957  146  56   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  5,443  3,939  1,209  241  54  187  91  75  15  6   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  6,502  4,694  1,464  282  62  228  111  92  17  8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  11,380  8,236  2,516  506  122  405  183  178  32  12   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  1,837  1,333  413  75  16  63  28  28  5  2   Total for all expansions   158,485  153,467  111,156  34,088  6,640  1,583  5,018  2,369  2,112  390  147    Expansion  Cards  Percentage of regular  Percentage of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  96.70%  69.50%  21.60%  4.60%  1.00%  3.30%  1.45%  1.50%  0.25%  0.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  96.98%  70.36%  21.60%  4.08%  0.94%  3.02%  1.48%  1.27%  0.19%  0.07%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  96.68%  69.96%  21.47%  4.28%  0.96%  3.32%  1.62%  1.33%  0.27%  0.11%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  96.61%  69.75%  21.75%  4.19%  0.92%  3.39%  1.65%  1.37%  0.25%  0.12%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  96.56%  69.89%  21.35%  4.29%  1.04%  3.44%  1.55%  1.51%  0.27%  0.10%   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  96.69%  70.16%  21.74%  3.95%  0.84%  3.31%  1.47%  1.47%  0.26%  0.11%   Total for all expansions   158,485  96.83%  70.14%  21.51%  4.19%  1.00%  3.17%  1.49%  1.33%  0.25%  0.09%  Disregarding the data from GvG (which is statistically irrelevant because of the small sample size), it appears that the chance of receiving a golden common card has been slightly increased as of the Old Gods expansion, while simultaneously lowering the chance of a regular common card. In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.

According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes.

The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.

Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs.

In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.

Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs.

In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

[19 ]  It is unknown whether the YouTube video catches all of the pack openings, since the raw data here was collected from the original Twitch VOD, and there were a lot of segues in-between pack openings, so the creator of the YouTube video might not have caught them all.

If I craft a golden legendary, does that prevent me from getting the non golden version of it? Cuz I happened to get a normal Leeroy despite having a golden copy a while back. I have since dusted the normal card but I feel like it shouldn't have been intended. 2. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the more legendaries I amass, the less likely I am to hit another legendary upon opening packs. My speculation is that it might be possible that the code (or whatever it is that dictates the odds of me getting a legendary) does not roll a legendary card before rolling again to randomise which legendary card I get. What I am saying is that, you roll the chances of getting a specific card, that's it. When it should be the case that you should roll the chance of getting a certain combination of rarities and then proceed to roll from the pool of each rarity, the card within that rarity. If the system uses the former method of operating, does this mean that once I happen to roll to a duplicate legendary, it will be cancelled and re-rolled to another card, severely crippling the chances of me getting another legendary as a result of me coincidentally owning the originally rolled legendary?            rabb1t MVP - Hearthstone   21705 posts    rabb1t Ignored       Aug 15  -2    Copy URL     View Post   08/14/2017 09:12 PM Posted by SkyaSh 2.

My speculation is that it might be possible that the code (or whatever it is that dictates the odds of me getting a legendary) does not roll a legendary card before rolling again to randomise which legendary card I get. This happens in any loot system. You have none of x - you need 20 of 100. You get some... You have some and need 10 of 100. Your chance is now much less than half of the original chance. (Yes, the percentage of the whole is 50%, but that's not how drawing 1 out of x pool works.) So yes, your chances of getting one are dropping, because the chance that one appears you don't have is becoming lower and lower as you get more. Is the code doing this? No. The base math of fewer of X in Y total pool does this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient            Holy   265 posts    Holy Ignored       Aug 15     Copy URL     View Post   Well blizzard was forced to admit to the average drop chance of a legendary cards because of chinas laws.

There are diminishing returns, overall, based on how many cards from said collection you have. As example... You have 10 cards of a 250 card collection. You buy 10 boosters. Odds are good to high you'll see cards you don't yet have. (Of any rarity.) vs. You have 200 cards of a 250 card collection. You buy 10 boosters. Odds are extremely low (towards approaching zero for some rarities) that you'll see new cards. Way back in the beta wipe I kind of kept mental track. It was at about 50 boosters that your odds of seeing new cards extremely dropped off. I was seeing about 1 card or less that I didn't have in boosters beyond that point. At 100+ opened it's almost impossible to get new cards from the booster. It's the same thing with loot if you've ever played any loot based game. You try and collect x set. As you get more pieces, the chance of a piece dropping you don't have from any given run diminishes because you have many of the pieces already.

Guess I won't try again though. Edit: I feel like I should try again for the OP. Won't waste my time putting in all the evidence again though: 1) yes 2) no. Having legendaries does not decrease your chance for more legendaries. How you describe it in your third paragraph is already how it works.

Every expansion set has its how pity timer counter. So depending how how many packs you have opened from each expansion, there is a very high chance that none of the Expansion packs you have opened has reached the 40 Packs limit.            kashnopersky   2 posts    kashnopersky Ignored       Dec 27     Copy URL     View Post   guys i have a question that I could not find a proper answer anywhere. So lets say from the KnC set, the only legendaries I don't have are sonya, ixlid and katherina. If I were to craft sonya, would that decrease the odds of me getting a legendary (either ixlid or katherina in this case) from my next KnC pack compared to the odds beforehands me crafting Sonya?

Bug forums is not for asking questions. Next time ask in any of the discussion forums. As it stands, chance would not change at all. The only difference would be that Sonya would no longer be available as drop from the packs.                   Join the Conversation        Ignored    Have something to say?

What was implemented was a guarantee of a legendary at specific points. You will get a Legendary in your first 10 packs ever for an expansion. This means that your 10th pack will give you a Legendary for sure, if you didn't get any in your first 9. This does NOT mean you have a better chance of getting on in the first 9 than you did before, only that you will absolutely get one in the 10th. After that, you get one every 40 packs at worst. This means that if you have bad luck, your legendary cards can come at: Pack 10 Pack 50 Pack 90 Pack 130 etc. The only difference between now and before is that before you could go all 130 packs without getting a single legendary.

I work a lot and I don't really have the luxury to play the game every day. On this account, I had only 10 packs to open and got 2 legendaries just now ... I guess they fixed it already and I lost my packs. I guess next time I will never buy & open packs in the first days of an expansion.

If a card is rolled on, the put in your pack, then has to pass a check to see if it's golden, the odds are the same no matter what, as long as there's a legendary in there.

They get to keep their regular version and craft another unowned legendary with the dust from the golden copy, whereas the collector gets to craft an epic from their dusted version. For me it works well, I usually know most of the cards I want in gold before the expansion launches, so it gives me the freedom to craft them before opening any packs and have a guarantee of no dupes, but there are certainly positives and negatives with this change. 06/22/2017 05:41 PM Posted by Mercutio Is that actually true?

Yes: Starting with the release of Hearthstone’s next expansion (but applying to ALL Hearthstone card packs), every time you open a Legendary in a card pack, it will be a Legendary card from the same set that you don’t already own. Once you own either the golden or non-golden version of a Legendary card, you won’t get a duplicate of it until you own all the Legendary cards from that set. Soon, you’ll be able to craft a Legendary without the worry of opening it in your next few packs!

A legendary in my two favorite decks, Elemental Shaman and Miracle Rogue, I opened as Golden. With that said this is still a positive change for the community as a whole. Will it cost me more to make a few Golden Legendary cards for my favorite classes? Yes; however, I prefer changes that are healthy for the community and this change is a POSITIVE one.            foxtrotter   92 posts    foxtrotter Ignored       Jun 23  (Edited)  -2    Copy URL     View Post   06/22/2017 06:10 PM Posted by Lykotic however, I prefer changes that are healthy for the community and this change is a POSITIVE one. I feel you there. Another positive change, that I would personally like to see, is Class Specific card packs. Also, a Marketplace to send all my Shaman, Priest, Warlock cards to, so others who like to play those cards, can send me their Warrior, Rogue, Hunter cards they don't play with, and we can finally have Trading in this card game. With the new system of Legendaries being opened in packs, I'll have to keep the Legendaries I don't use, as a placeholder in all those classes I don't play, losing the opportunity cost of the dust I could have, just so I don't get them AGAIN, until the point comes a year from now, when I have collected all the Legendaries. Only then can I dust the ones I don't use.            Tao   1082 posts    Tao Ignored       Jun 23  (Edited)  4    Copy URL     View Post   Let's look at the math here. Assuming that there are 21 legendaries in the expac, and you have a 1/13 chance at getting a golden on your next legendary. How many packs do you need to open to get what you want? Well, it depends on what you want. If you want to open one of each legendary, it'll currently take ~1540 packs.  (That's 20 packs per legendary,  and 77 legendaries to get one of each https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem) In those 1540 packs, to go with your 56 duplicates you will likely have found 6 golden Legendaries. Under the new setup, it'll take 420 packs to get a complete collection, and you will probably have found 2 goldens. If you are wanting a specific golden legendary, you are looking at odds of 1/273 (1/21 x 1/13) or 0.3663% each time your pity timer is up. Currently that number is consistent. Under the new plan it would be 0.3663% of getting it on your first legendary of the expac (first 10 packs) and, each time you open a legendary that isn't the one that you want, your odds improve for the next roll to 0.3846% (1/20 x 1/13, for legendary number two) increasing each time you open a different legendary up to 7.69% (1/13)if its your last one, or until you get it non golden whereupon yes, your odds drop to 0 for the next 21-N legendaries, when it bounces back to 0.3663% So perhaps a better title for this thread would be "Odds fluctuate +7.3% -0.3% for finding unique golden legendary."

As much as I'd like to see this, I think this would be an exploitable system. Because anyone could set up as many accounts as they'd like and do as many quests as they can to buy a lot of packs with gold and trade the cards to their main account. One way around this, would be changing the system of buying cards and card packs. They could make a market place in which you can buy cards with gold only and packs can only be bought with real money (which would anger a lot of players and rightly so). Also they could restrict trading to "a card for a card" but then you'd have to ensure that the value of the cards is at least roughly equal. I mean even if you say that rarity is the deciding factor (meaning you can only trade commons for commons, rares for rares and so on) there still are cards that in their bracket that are worth more than others. Or would anyone care to trade Ysera for Milhouse Manastorm? So all in all, I don't think we'll se a trading system in Hearthstone, because it's either prone for misuse or the necessary changes would alienate players.

Someone knows what is it? I checked but numbers are old and not the same depending on the site. In my last 47 packs (15 Whispers, 15 Classics, 15 Grand Tournament bought, and 2 bought with gold), I got 6 ledendary, 2 of them golden (Malygos and King Krush), It struck me as almost unbelievable. I play since a year and had not yet to see a Golden Legendary and now 2 in a row? Something's happening? Am I the only one?

Wherever I looked it said it is around 1% per card or 5% per pack (and from my longtime experience it is not that far off). A reason you might experience these cluster is you buying different sorts of packs. If your pity timer was already up with those you might have had a bigger chance for one legendary in each of them and then just got lucky to draw the other 3. Even if it was not the pity timer 47 packs is no sample size at all in matter of statistics and it's "only" 255% of the expected amount of packs.

Like if it is a while since I draw a legendary, I'm due, and I was probably was due for all sorts of packs? And also, the odds are not for all packs, but for different sorts of pack?

In short you start a a chance of slightly below 5% with the first pack of a kind opened and it increases slightly at first and steeper at later stages to 100% at (suspected) 40th pack to be at around 5% for the average pack. This counter of packs without legendary is stored for every kind of pack (classic, tgt, wog) separate.

If there actually is a pity timer, I haven't seen any indication of it so far when buying packs with gold. I consider myself lucky though to ever have drawn any legendaries with gold packs.

However, I've seen no difference between real money or gold. Of my 47 packs, 45 were money bought, and 2 gold bought. I got golden Malygos in a gold bought one. And on the first pack you get when you join, I got Malygos non golden, I got Tirion in a Tavern Brawl pack, Yogg in a 0-3 Arena pack, etc. Guess I'm just lucky, but I mean I don't see any difference between the 2 ways to purchase.

Miro   5 posts    Miro Ignored       Dec 9, 2016  (Edited)  -1    Copy URL     View Post   I had 56 packs of MSOG, 50 bought as pre-purchase and another 6 from ingame quests and I got only 1 legendary card (0.35% drop rate). Three of my friends got 10 packs each (6 from quests and 4 bought by ingame gold) and all of them got 2 legendaries. So I don't know if there was some Blizzard's problem when I was opening my packs or what happened, but 0.35% drop rate is really ridiculous for me and I don't think I will ever buy packs for real money. Plus the problem with tri-class drop rate is not helping me to believe Blizzard has everything under control.

If you were compensated by Blizzard during the Tri-class bug, you should have gotten 19 more packs, which puts you at 75; possibly still no Legendary.

Well, I don't think this is within realms of expectation, when normally there is about 1 - 2% drop rate. This is at least 3 times less then the lower rate is and about 5 times less then the average. And I wasn't compensated, because I didn't open any pack before the hotfix.

Blizzard did mention the chance of receiving Legendary is 1 in 20, or about 5%, as you stated. Data collected over time says that due to randomness, there's a hidden "pity timer" that keeps track the last time you've received a Legendary for a specific set. The data compiled shown that the highest number of packs you can go without a single Legendary is 39, with the 40th guaranteeing you one; thus, bringing the percentage up to 2.5% at worst. What does this mean? It means that if you hope to get Legendaries from a specific set, buying batches in multiples of 40 will do it. In 56 packs, it is possible to receive only one Legendary. It is also conjectured that the same happens to Epics in multiples of 10. In 56 packs, you should have received at least 5 Epics as well, in theory.

To be truth I hoped to get about 3 - 5 legendaries of the 280 cards I got, but only 1 was really disappointment.

Someone knows what is it? I checked but numbers are old and not the same depending on the site. In my last 47 packs (15 Whispers, 15 Classics, 15 Grand Tournament bought, and 2 bought with gold), I got 6 ledendary, 2 of them golden (Malygos and King Krush), It struck me as almost unbelievable. I play since a year and had not yet to see a Golden Legendary and now 2 in a row? Something's happening? Am I the only one? You got lucky... I have opened 50 packs and received only 3 legandary cards. I dont even have a single golden legendary... and I play since Naxx.

I don't have the data published to the site yet, but in those 12k arena drafts the chance of getting a legendary on a given pick is just under 1% (~.86%). And ~22% of arenas have at least one legendary. The numbers for epics are about a 3.5% chance per pick with about 63% of arenas having at least one. Obviously this data is all manually entered, so it's not scientific fact and should be taken with a grain of salt. But nonetheless it is probably a pretty solid data point about the frequency of legendaries.            firerider   466 posts    firerider Ignored       Mar 14, 2014  (Edited)     Copy URL     View Post   03/14/2014 01:39 PM Posted by elias I built Arena Mastery, which has about ~12,000 decks tracked (when I checked these numbers last week).

Chances of 2 legends are roughly 22.8%^2 = 5.19% (This calculation is for simplicity. If someone would develop an accurate formula here that would be great). Chance of 3 legends are 22.8%^3 = 1.18%. Chances of 4 are 22.8%^4 = 0.27%. Think we can stop here. EV(legend) = 1*0.228 + 2*0.0519 + 3*0.0118 + 4* 0.0027= 0.378 legend/arena Will do the Epics later. Do we have values for rares?

Around 4% odds to get 1 or less legendary pick in 20 arenas. Around 1/27000 odds to not get offered an epic in 10 arenas. That's not too bad I guess, feels pretty bad playing like rogue and seeing an epic pick - you know you either get a dead card or a really situational card at best. Unless you get lucky and get offered that only neutral epic card that's actually very good. It is druid where you like seeing epic picks and fine in pally/shaman/warrior, everything else has only 1 good/fine class epic and pretty rare to get it over all the bad epics.            justinckoh   1 posts    justinckoh Ignored       May 10, 2015  1    Copy URL     View Post   Not to make you feel bad, but I just got 3 legendaries for my arena deck.

I've completed about 40 wins at this level now, and I've never seen more than a golden rare... I don't understand, am I doing something wrong? You're not doing anything wrong. The probability of getting at least one legendary out of 40 card rewards is only slightly higher than 35%, pretty close in probability compared to opening 40 cards from 8 packs. That's is for categorical: common, rare, epic, legendary distribution. The expected number of legendaries in 40 cards is only around 0.43 However, rolling categorical: golden or not golden... that's completely different from pack distributions. Empirically, the 8+ reward card being golden instead of normal is close to 62.5%, much much higher compared to packs.

Anyway, by chinese and south Korean new laws, the comapny had to open this info to the public, confirming both drop rates we had so far + the pitty timer. All games: Hearthstone: Each card pack will have at least one Rare or higher card Approximately one in five packs will have an Epic card Approximately one in 20 packs will have a Legendary card Overwatch: Each loot box will contain at least one Rare item An Epic item will appear once every 5.5 loot boxes, on average A Legendary item will appear once every 13.5 loot boxes, on average Heroes of the Storm: Every loot chest will contain, on average, 2.9 regular items and one rare item Epic items will appear once per 4.5 loot boxes, on average Legendary items will appear once every 17.5 loot boxes, on average The so-called "pity timer" also appears to be in effect for Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, . It will guarantee a Legendary drop if you haven't  opened one in 39 packs from the same set (e.g. Clasic, UnGoro, etc). The pity timer goes to 0 whenever a legendary is oppened Edited: The part about the pity timer and crafting as it is only speculated about.            kyross   219 posts    kyross Ignored       19 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   19/07/2017 12:06 Posted by Azra The pity timer goes to 0 whenever a legendary is crafted Really ?

That would pretty drastically change my usual pack opening / card crafting strategy, so it would be great to know if that happens to be true Actually it is unclear, as it's hard to predict when you will open a legend exactly. Both WoW and D3 have pitty timer on legendaries and ancient ones (D3). In WoW the pitty timer on drops is unnafected by crafting. In D3, you have a 1 in 10 pitty timer on all legend/set items (seems to be in 1 game sesion so far) so if you transmute into legendaries 10 items, 1 (usually the 10th, lol) is with ancient quality. And it resets the pitty timer both on drops and crafted items. Here is the info source http://hs.blizzard.cn/articles/20/9546 It doesnt state the word "pitty" and "timer", but what else could it be. Anyway, crafting after getting a legendary from a pack is wise, as you guarantee it will not be a dupe (which will not be a concern after the exp hits) and you have the chance to save some dust as you can open exatcly what you want. Btw, there seems to be decraese in golden cards drop rates, since the chest reward update was introduced.

If so, can you get 3 legendaries in 4 packs? (someone complained about getting 3 Sylvanas in 4 packs a while ago so I do not know what to believe) or is no more than 1 in 20 and 1 in 5 there is a pity timer for legendaries you said, but is there a pity timer for epics? I happened to open 8 packs in the last 3 days and the first 7 were 4 common 1 rare while the last one was 3 common 1 rare 1 epic, I haven't got a legendary in a while and the last epic was about I'd estimate 6 packs before that 8 packs (it takes me some time to get packs as I tend to play arena for packs so I may recycle the gold) and also there is there only one pity timer for all sets or 1 for each card set that doesn't reset whit the opening of a new legendary? If you could give me a link or something, please excuse my lack of understanding but I tend to make lists and keep track of events and that turns me more or less in a perfectionist            Vlad   3449 posts    Vlad Ignored       19 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   1 in 5 and 1 in 20 are averages.

This is from months ago. Even though not officially confirmed the pity timers are 40 for legendaries, 10 for epics, are set specific and have nothing to do with crafting. For KFT it's almost certain they won't change any of the drop rates, but if they do you'll know within hours of it launching, just like the tri-class card debacle with MSG. Too many people collecting stats for them to pull a fast one.            Azra   2081 posts    Azra Ignored       20 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   20/07/2017 00:06 Posted by Ixnay ..just?

Google translate: In addition, it should be noted that: with the number of cards to increase the number of packages, players actually get high-quality card card probability will also increase. So I repeat no official confirmation of the pity timer. I do seem to recall someone accidentally saying that the 50 pack pre-order guarentees at least 2 legendaries (ie 10 pity time > 40 pity timer) so everyone knows it but it wouldn't surprise me if the legal team / complaints team don't want it officaialised just due to the number of false "I went 41 packs without a legend" messages they'd have to deal with.

Also I'm pretty sure I had reforges that ran more than 10, even in my very limited sample size. The legendary drop pity timer in diablo has been time-based before (and I doubt it ever changed), where as time passes without getting any legedaries, drop chances from monsters increases. Unless the timer has been changed (it was in the range of hour(s)), it is never triggering nowadays, when you get legendaries left and right. Yet this diablo pity timer is actually the one that gave the concept its name (it certainly doesn't make much sense to call it 'timer' in hearthstone and would be more accurate as 'counter'). I was recording the results of all my pack openings for last 2 expansions now and so far the community implied pity timers for epic, legendary, golden common and golden rare seem to be correct (never went over and had multiple close calls). I haven't gotten close to the timer on golden epic and haven't gotten a single golden legendary at all in those packs (noone ever opened enough packs of a single expansion to provide any data towards the pity timer on golden legendary).

Point is, 10% on avg doesnt guarantte an ancient in 10 drops. you could get 3 at drops 18/23/29 from 30 -thats why the pitty timer :) Or you can get 3 ancients in 3 drops and then have none to 30. To avoid such situation u have the pitty timer. Same as in HS. You have less then 2% chance to get a legendary that increases to ~30% at 20 packs oppened and then goes up to 100% at your 40th pack, So - pitty timer that matches the chance ;). Agre on the rest, gave diablo only as example, the legend drops there are much different then those in HS, you have much more (less chance to lend the right one for your build) and each stat is rolled from a pool of stats - what it will be and what is it range, so you need much more drops, but at the end it feels the sam (6 weeks without finding ancient Focus/Restrain combo with sockets and proper stats FEELS BAD MAN!!)

That's what I'm saying, I'm pretty sure there is no pity timer for ancients in diablo, or at least it certainly is not 10 - you could as easily get a dry run of 20. An average of 10% and pity timer at 10 would only be possible if you ALWAYS got it on 10th, as every drop before 10 would push the average above 10%; and I'm pretty sure I've seen at least one blizzard official post stating that ancient rate is 10%, not to mention unofficial statistics confirming that. (For example: 10, 10, 10, 10, 5 makes it 11.11% average and you can't bring it down ever, since you cant add anything over 10 - I hope you see here why a 10% average with 10th guaranteed drop is simply impossible (unless its 10, 10, 10 ad infinitum, which is not the case). So summing it up, the pity timer (or guaranteed drop) has to always be higher than the average timer. In hearthstone its double the average, most likely making the median drop time of somewhere in the 3rd quartile (depending on the actual probability distribution).

Feels weird that something as likely as that ruins a game for you, maybe you should avoid situations that involve gambling?            yousef   26 posts    yousef Ignored       08 Feb  -4    Copy URL     View Post   i got around 8 nozdormu form classic i gave up on classic i even don't have ice block or any good epic from classic i crafted some cards but i gave up on buying them for the hope of getting something good and form all expansion 90% of legendary i open unfortunately considered trash the luck system can be brutal even mario party hate me :(            Dobermann   41 posts    Dobermann Ignored       08 Feb  2    Copy URL     View Post   I only bought the welcome bundle so far (and I got a pretty OP legendary from it), but there was a streak where I did not get any legendary card at all then after 40 pack openings I got this: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Nat_Pagle Which is pretty much useless and all about luck.

Proper probability numbers are three non-stacking chances to get legendary with 1/4 (25%) probability. Well, if you want to get the probabilities straight, let's use the Grand Tournament Card Pack Opening and its 15'432 packs as a reference, since it's the basic reference when it comes to pity timer and legendary card opening statistics anyway. Considering he opened no legendary within 10 packs in each set, let's say his pity timers were anywhere between 0 and 29, and use the average legendary opening chance for each pack (the use of the average is relatively relevant due to said chance only significantly increasing beyond 30 packs). The average probability of opening a legendary in a pack with a 0 to 30 pity timer is 0.054155969. Considering 10 packs without a legendary, repeated thrice (one for each Mammuth set), the resulting probability is ((1-0.054155969)^10)^3 = 18.82% So, while not the most likely thing, opening a Mammuth Bundle and not receiving a legendary definitely isn't something impossible - especially considering the fact that the lower pity timer before the opening, the likelier it is to not get a single legendary Source: https://amp.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3zaeou/pity_timer_on_packs_opening_analysiskinda_proofed/            Xavathos   1086 posts    Xavathos Ignored       08 Feb  2    Copy URL     View Post   Because legendaries are the reason to buy packs, right?

Yet they make the decks powerful, moreso than any legendary ever would. Legendaries are the perfect cherry on top, but let's not forget the actual cake, shall we?

If i was to start HS now with the info i know now i would buy it maybe because i would get 3 legendaries guaranteed out of them. 1 out of forst 10 packs opened. So what are the odds after newbie legendary drop in first 10 packs for a legendary? What is a pity timer? Did you get no good usable cards out of it? In the info i read some epic cards are even better then legendary drops. I donot have the money for the mammoth bundle but for me as new player it sounds a good option to build collection. Wish my birthday was coming up as it would make a nice gift. Lol. Last question. As i read posts it sounds like if you get a legendary you can make a deck around it. Does that mean every legendary has a good deck possibility to build around? Or are there also support legendary? I mean i dusted milhouse and the steward guy as i couldnot see potential of these cards.

I've bought over 40 packets within the last 2 weeks and no legendaries at all, some golden cards but there usually just uncommon so not really worth that much disenchanting for dust. So yeah a small percentage in legendary drop chance would be appreciated or at least fix it so you're guaranteed a legendary after a certain amount of packs say like 30 since if you disenchanted all the cards from 30 packs assuming there all 1 rare and 4 commons you could make a legendary. Before anybody else says it, i don't think it should apply to packs bought with real money just ones you've bought with coins or earned playing the game.

You have a small chance of legendary in 1 pack, your chance increases as you open more of that type of pack. For example (not accurate numbers) 1% chance ->2nd pack of same type -> 2% chance. Etc until you get one and it resets. At 40 packs if you have not gotten a legendary you are GURENTEED one. So anyone complaining about only 1 legendary you just got unlucky. 1 legendary per 20 is the average. I also believe epics follow the same rule but for every 10. Could be wrong though.

That's 9 legendaries in 196 packs. This is almost exactly the droprate from pre-MSoG packs. It looks like Blizzard did not change anything. I would also like to point out that I bought every single pack with ingame currency and apart from one early promotion card (golden Gelbin Mekkatorque) my account is 100% f2p. The packs I bought and dust I saved allow me to craft 2 legendaries of my choice in each region. I have two copies of most common and many rare cards, meaning I'll get my 40 dust from every pack now. Together with the reward at the end of the month that's almost one more legendary card that I can craft every month, just by doing my daily quests. And still, when I read the forum, I get the impression people are starving to death, plundered mercilessly by that greedy Blizzard capitalists.

I've been playing for more than 3 months now, opened god knows how much packs and haven't got a single legendary card, not once. I didn't count exactly, but I think I'm opening at least 4-5 packs a week in average and still nothing. Is that normal or just bad luck on my side?

Worth noting is that the pity timer tracks packs opened for each type individually, so in order to be guaranteed a Classic legendary you'll need to open 40 Classic packs, 20 Classic and 20 WotOG won't do it, however it'll grant you 50 % progress towards the guaranteed legendary for each of those 2 pack types.            davor992   2 posts    davor992 Ignored       08 May 2016     Copy URL     View Post   Looks like I'll keep waiting for the pity timer -.- Thanks :)            Zorth   1940 posts    Zorth Ignored       08 May 2016     Copy URL     View Post   08/05/2016 16:22 Posted by Marceronni You're guaranteed at least 1 legendary per 40 packs because of a 'pity timer'.

What I remember, getting legendaries from adventures was very helpful at start. Especially Emperor Thaurissan is invaluable and at the beginning, I was simply putting him into every deck I made. Now, half year later, I have all legendaries from available adventures and just very few from packs. If you want to have useful legendaries, either get them from adventures or craft them. That is what I do.            Vlad   3449 posts    Vlad Ignored       29 Mar 2017  1    Copy URL     View Post   Or play decks that don't evolve around legendaries. Pirate Warrior (urgh!) and Dragon Priest come to mind. Still quite a bit of adventures and crafting for the Dragon Priest deck though. And maybe it is a unpopular opinion but Ranked play is very competitive. Players with more resources will out value players will less resources down in the lower ranks so early on F2P players will likely be overrun by paying players. Rank 15 and up almost everyone has meta decks and it's skill from that point onwards. However it is possible. I have F2P colleagues that play for quite sometime and they build powerful tier 1 decks by opening packs, dusting and creating cards. It's a grind for them I admit, they told me that early on they had to put a lot of games up to get as many packs as possible but they became and are competitive and have fun. The difference between paying and not paying is how fast can we build meta decks and get over that Rank 15 threshold. From that moment on, money or not is, in my limited experience, less relevant.

But those numbers aren't actually useful for figuring out your chances of getting a legendary or golden card next time. If you aren't familiar with Hearthstone , it's a collectible card game similar to Magic: The Gathering . To get more cards, you buy 'expert packs' with your in-game winnings, or with real money. You get random cards, with four levels of rarity  — Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary. Advertisement The Wrong Numbers So what's the problem with everyone's numbers? Each expert pack gives you five cards, one of which is guaranteed to be Rare or better. Let's take my own post as an example: Common 142 71.0% Rare 49 24.5% Epic 8 4.0% Legendary 1 0.5% Advertisement So these numbers are accurate in that they reflect what percentage of each rarity we got in the 200 cards we drew, but they're useless if I was trying to guess what future packs might hold and decide if it's worth spending real money on expert packs. Every time you open a pack in Hearthstone , you're getting five cards, so you need to find the probability that any of those five will be what you're looking for, and account for the guaranteed rare card. Data Sources To find the data, I obviously couldn't buy 1,000 packs, even on Kotaku 's budget. But luckily, most people who plunk down $50 ( or more ) on cards also tend to post their results for people to watch. So I manually entered data from a variety of videos into a spreadsheet. There was speculation that Blizzard changed the card drop rates since the game officially launched in March, so I only used videos that were posted within the past two months (91% from the past month). Advertisement Results Okay, so now that we have more data, let's see what useful information we can get out of it. We're looking for something that can give us an idea of what will be in the next pack we open, and what that pack will be worth. So, from 1,000 packs:  Count Percent of Total Probability Per Pack Common 3565 71.30% 99.81% Rare 1155 23.10% 73.11% Epic 215 4.30% 19.73% Legendary 65 1.30% 6.33% Advertisement So every pack you open has a 99.81% chance of containing at least one common card. Now we're on the right track! If you go down from there, you'll see that the chances of getting at least one legendary card in a pack are actually considerably better than the .5% that we got from our 40 pack experiment . Now, while we did expand the sample size, we didn't observe all the possible combinations of cards. In 1,000 packs, we saw 16 of 55 possible combinations. The most common pack after a '4100' (4 common, 1 rare; 61% of packs) was a '3200' (3 common, 2 rare; 12.20%). Fun Facts The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion There's a 0.4% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80% There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust The best pack in our sample was 1 common, 2 rares, 1 epic, and 1 legendary UPDATE : Since Blizzard has released new DLC, we don't know if these numbers are still accurate. Thanks to everyone who sent in packs! Advertisement This is a pretty good sample size, but our data could be even more accurate with more information. So here are some ways to contribute: If you have 15 packs or more, put the data in a spreadsheet and send it to steve@kotaku.com, along with a video of opening the packs (for verification) and we'll update the data. Here's the spreadsheet layout: If you can't do that, post a screenshot of your best or worst pack in the comments! Advertisement Special thanks to @indiemaiden for crunching all the numbers, and Kotaku's Chris Person for the image. If you're interested in the videos where the data came from: 40 packs , 40 , 15 , 80 , 40 , 15 , 40 , 600 , 90 . To contact me, write to steve@kotaku.com or follow me on Twitter @Appleguysnake .

They secretly lowered the chances of getting legend plus the pity timer has been upped to at least 50 or more.  I should know, I opened fewer legs nowadays.

In 20 packs,  35.9% for exactly 0 legendary  37.7% for exactly 1 legendary  18.9% for exactly 2 legendary  7.5% for 3 or more legendary    In 40 packs,  0% for exactly 0 legendary (yay pity timer)  39.9% for exactly 1 legendary  27.8% for exactly 2 legendary  18.5% for exactly 3 legendary  13.8% for 4 or more legendary    In 52 packs,  25.9% for exactly 1 legendary  Etc      So while unlucky,  roughly 1 in 4 is hardly a statistical anomaly.

You can find an equal no. of ppl claiming otherwise, theres really no reason why blizzard would change the drop rate. They've already given us a free legendary this expansion  Increasing legendary drop rates so ppl buy less packs and those even buying decide to go f2p cuz blizzard just decides to give 4 legs in 15 packs? Doesn't seem like a good business strategy to me.

Even after opening 1000 packs there is a huge chance you won't open 50 legendaries(which how it is should be). Opening packs has huge variance, people please don't open threads like this every 5hours!

Only got 2 legendaries, no bullshit.  My friend pre-purchased the 50 packs and got 9 legendaries (one gold). He also had 5100 gold to buy 51 packs and got only 2 legendaries in those.  Blizzard rigged p2w packs?    Same thing if you think back to ungoro. I bought 45 packs with gold, received no legendary at all. Another friend who pre-purchased the packs got 2 golden legendaries and like 5 normal legendaries.

Chinese link is here: http://hs.blizzard.cn/articles/20/9546  UTC 0930 Edit: They've edited some words for the statement regarding RARE cards, as bolded and in italics below   Translation  In adherence to new laws, Hearthstone is hereby declaring the odds of getting specific card rarities, with details as below.  Note: Each Hearthstone pack will contain cards of 4 different rarities  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack  EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs  LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs  In addition, please note that as players open more packs, the actual probabilities of getting cards of a higher quality increases.   Original Text   根据国家相关法规，《炉石传说》现将抽取卡牌的概率进行公布，具体如下：  备注：每包《炉石传说》卡牌包，均包含4张不同品质的卡牌。  稀有卡牌  每包炉石卡牌包至少可获得一张稀有 或更高 品质 的 卡牌。  史诗卡牌  平均5个炉石卡牌包，可获得一张史诗品质卡牌。  传说卡牌  平均20个炉石卡牌包，可获得一张传说品质卡牌。  此外，需要说明的是：随着卡牌包抽取数量的增多，玩家实际获得高品质卡牌的概率也将同步提高。   Source:  https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/69dexs/china_announces_hearthstone_card_pack_rarity_odds/    Personal Opinion:  Im pretty sad and upset about this, since it does not even provide some numbers. Its not totally clear and Golden Droprates arent mentioned either. I mean sure after 3 years of gathering data by the community itself, many things got figured out, but in all respect, this seems like they try to avoid as much information as possible and write it down in the most vague way possible. Really dissapointing.

The percentage here is you get an epic in 20% of the packs and that's the precise percentage you are asking for.  Sure the information they provided is vague and incomplete (there's no mention to golden probability and the pity timer is just named but not explained) but the little information in the post seems prety precise to me.

" In addition, please note that as players open more packs, the actual probabilities of getting cards of a higher quality increases."  As you can see, its actually not 1% for legendaries and its not 4% on epics since the chance of obtaining those increases, which means after my first pack i opened, the numbers change.The wording "Average" makes you believe that you simply can devide numbers and get an outcome just as you did. But if you take an "increasing chance" into consideration, "average", isnt what you think it is. Also, many believe that a pity timer means that if you didnt get a legendary on your 39th pack, you will get it at your 40th guaranteed. Well, kinda true, but how does this lead up to? It doesent mean that a number jumps from 0 to 100%. There are numbers and calculators before that. And this is what i wanted to know. The 1 out 20 legendary on average is an information that we already know since ages and if a state like china rules out a law that has the job to make loot boxes transperent, we dont need more vague responses, but precise responses.

But yeah, if we're going to force Blizzard into becoming more transparent, East Asia (where regulations on online entertainment is far stricter than NA) is the way to go. This isn't an amazing start, as Blizzard is clearly still playing word games here, but it's a start. China's a big market for Blizzard (maybe even bigger than NA), so hopefully pressure on their side will force Blizzard to open even more statistics up.

I mean, i understand that blizzard does not want to reveal those numbers, they want this as unclear as possible, but if a law rules out with the goal to make it transparent for users that gamble on loot boxes, one should not get away with this unclear information.    what it effectively means is that out of 100 cards (5 per pack, 20 packs) you end up with a 50% chance of getting a legendary.  So if I'm getting my math right, that would amount to a .5% chance of getting a legendary per card or a 2.5% per pack.    Note that this isn't REALLY the perfect number.  The issue is that it's NOT a set % per pack.  They have indirectly confirmed the Pity Timer and the timer gradually increases the chance of getting a particular rarity as you open more packs.  Thus if you JUST opened a legendary, your chance of the next pack getting a legendary is less than at the 20th pack.  So it's a sliding scale that we'd need one of the math pros to calculate.  Thus there is some merit to the way it's presented now.  If you get a set of 20 packs you have a coin flip that a pack will be in there.  If you get a set of 40 packs, you get a 100% chance of getting a legendary.  Similar story with 5 and 10 packs with epics.  For the record, if the % chance was locked it would make a 2% chance per card, and a 10% per pack).  As far as the 'information is just what we already know' well that's still useful since it's a confirmation.  Blizzard never HAS confirmed any of our numbers.  Also me and many others have been spouting the "Legendary is 1% per card" statement even though it makes no sense if the average is 20 packs.  As far as them not posting the per pack numbers I just wrote with the "the chance increases as you get packs" statement.. I guess China's law isn't as straitforward and strict as we thought :P.  Either that or China is going to raising a fuss at Blizzard soon.  (though I don't think hiding the gold card percentages is kosher.  I thin they are hoping China doesn't notice since THAT percentage is going to be VERY ugly)           Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack     One does not simply walk into Mordor,  unless they want to be the best they can be.               #15   May 5, 2017  (Un'Goro Launch)           Alexandru_91    Alexandru_91      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  Novice Engineer     1  7  29     Join Date: 5/4/2015   Posts: 45   BattleTag: DomnuLupu#2103   Member Details             I made some calculations and the results seem like this (for a legendary) :  1 pack..................20 packs............................40 packs  2.5%.....................50%....................................100%  With the rate increasing by 2.5% per pack to open a legendary (at least it follows the rule they have said)  Doable for epic drop rates as well , i suspect the pity timer is when you have 100% drop chance on the 40th pack because of the perpetual increase.

This doesn't explain anything. There's no telling if the chance grows in a linear or an exponential way.    Maybe it's just my lack of coffee, but while the rest of this post made sense... this part really didn't. So if we open more packs it scales? Or is this just acknowledging there is a pity timer?  Otherwise the rest seems okay I suppose; I spent a lot of years collecting baseball cards and physical card games, and it was common to see the average packs it would take to open something of X rarity or type. This is at least useful to confirm the Reddit math on it.

At least if I'm remembering what people have said about the pity timer right, you'd be guaranteed a Legendary in 40 packs of the same expansion but it wouldn't trigger if you bought 20 of one and 20 of another.

As far as we understand from gathered data is that it all comes and goes with the pity timer, which basically regulates everything. What this means i explain here a bit:  First of all, to answer your question, different sets have seperate counters, which means that if you opened lets say 39 classic packs without a legendary, you would under normal circumanstances get one at your 40 th pack, but only if thats a classic pack. It does not affect other sets, like Un Goro for instance.  Now to the pity timer:  Lets take the example of an average epic draw. Blizzard stated that you get 1 epic card out of 5 packs on average. Thats 1 card out of 25.  As we know your average legendary draw is 1 card out of 20 packs or in other words 1 out of 100.  So its easy to assume that your chance of getting a legendary is basically 1%, but thats not quite the reality, because blizzard just stated that your chances increase from pack to pack you didnt open one.  So far i understand average as the middle point and pity timer as the end point. Average is 20 packs for a legendary, and Pity timer is 40 packs for a legendary. Same should be true for epics. 1 out of 5 packs is the average, 10 packs should be the pity timer.  But its not clear from where the higher chances start. Do i have a higher chance for a legend after my first pack or is it the same until i hit the average number? Well, i hope you understand that by splitting your pack openings into multiple sets, you reduce your chance of finding something guaranteed. (Quality). In your example though you will open at least 1 epic card out of 10 packs (pity timer).

Between the two answers, I've gathered what I needed to know... and even something more ;)  About this:   So its easy to assume that your chance of getting a legendary is basically 1%, but thats not quite the reality, because blizzard just stated that your chances increase from pack to pack you didnt open one.

Unfortunately, my math is a bit rusty atm, so I'd like to think about it a little, before committing to say anything. No promises, but stay tuned!

I have the complete collection of non gold cards, which I have either packed or crafted by disenchanting duplicates. I have bought at least 500 packs overall and opened around 500+ from Arena rewards, all of the Tavern brawls plus free packs I have been given by Blizzard for Iphone/Preorder promotions.  I have never packed a Golden Legendary in 1000+ packs, my RNG with Epics and regular Legendarys seems ok and even above average at times but I even seem to get regular Legendarys twice as often as Golden Epics.  Is this normal? I often see the Golden Legendary text pop up when one of my friends get it. I even had a friend who got 3x Golden Legendarys in his first 50 packs of TGT.  I am not salty, I am fortunate enough to have a full collection but at this point is don't even bother looking at the Legendarys I pack because I know it will be a duplicate, I only get excited for Golden Cards and I find even Golden Commons rare to find.

Anyway, 1 in 13,7 legendarys you uncover is gonna be golden. So yeah, its rare.    It also says that a card has a 0.07% of being a golden legendary, or a 0.35% chance of finding one in a pack. In their data they had only 56 golden legendaries in 15,109 packs opened.  So yeah,  going you whole life without ever opening one is entirely possible.    That's rubbish. No way. I should have got 10 of them by now then. Instead of 0.

Regular legendary pity timer is about 1 in 40. Golden legendary is about 1 in 310. This 2 got their own separate pity timer  I had been keeping track since dec last year from my last (regular) legendary, than at pack 25 i gotten Golden Jaxx (i havent got 1 since i start playing since almost beta), 8 pack later which is 33 i gotten a tirion (this doesnt prove they got separate timer, however, what are the odds to pull 2 legendary in 8 pack, i am that unlucky type as well base on playing almost 2 year and only gotten 1 golden legendary recently.)

Blizzard      Hearthstone      Big, big news out of Hearthstone today, and I do not say that lightly. The game has been criticized for its increasingly high cost now that there are three expansions a year, combined with low legendary drop rates and decks that require the high-cost, extremely rare cards to function.  Blizzard’s solution? Drop a Diablo 3 Loot 2.0 generosity bomb on the whole situation.  Today, Hearthstone director Ben Brode announced a number of major changes when it comes to pack opening in Hearthstone, chief among them that players will no longer will receive duplicate Legendaries from packs, starting when the next expansion launches.  This has long been a requested fix from fans, especially in an era when new expansions can launch with 23 Legendaries (Un’goro), where you get one Legendary per 20 packs on average. Add in the chance to get many, many duplicates in that process and it’s a recipe for fan frustration.    In addition to this duplicate news, Brode also announced that all players would receive a Legendary within their first ten expansion packs. This will prevent players from testing the 40 pack  “mercy rule” when it comes to loading up an expansion for the first time and shelling out for dozens of packs. This has been another frequent buzz-killer the past few expansions.    Finally, packs will no longer contain more than two of the same common, epic or rare per pack, which is not really that common of an occurrence, but it can’t hurt.   The Legendary dupe issue is what’s the most significant, and it has to be the result of Blizzard taking a long, hard look at Hearthstone ’s problems. There’s a fine line between making sure your game is maximizing revenue but not turning off players because of its high cost. Lately, it’s felt like Hearthstone has become more expensive than ever, and Blizzard might be looking at some data showing players dropping out over time, feeling like they just can’t keep up.  Hearthstone will still cost a lot money, sure. Getting 20 Legendaries in a set will still take 400 packs on average, after all, but this change could have a lot of positive beneficial effects for the game. Players can now freely craft Legendaries without worrying they might get another copy. Players will have more dust to craft all the other cards they want when they’re getting more Legendaries in packs instead of having to spend 1600 dust on them. And with more Legendaries (and epics and rares) getting to more players, it might even help the overall health of the game, with players able to experiment more with new decks based on cards they might not have had otherwise (eh, who am I kidding? Everyone will still netdeck).  Blizzard must be really confident that this is the right move for Hearthstone going forward, because this isn’t the kind of thing you can announce and then take back later when you don’t like how much you’re giving away. But it’s hard to see any way this doesn’t help the health of the game overall, and I really applaud Blizzard for making this change. We will see how this ends up changing the course of Hearthstone in the coming months and years, and what problems may still remain going forward, even after this fix.  PS. What about goldens? Is a duplicate a duplicate if it's golden? Hmm.  Update : And I....totally missed the news that this same thing is happening to Overwatch loot boxes as well. Although there it's "fewer" duplicate Legendaries, not eliminating them completely.

Comments     Shares       Earlier today, we learned about the Overwatch loot box drop rates in China, revealed by Blizzard as required by new Chinese law. Now we've got the same information for Hearthstone , which appears to dole out its best stuff at a slightly slower rate. The Google translation of the Chinese original , as always, is rough, but it works out like this: Every Hearthstone pack will contain at least one card of "rare" quality of better; "epic" cards will appear at an average of one every five packs; and "legendary" cards will turn up at a rate of one every 20 packs.  The rates are pretty close to what players have already established independently: This thread from December 2016, for instance, references previous research determining that legendaries drop at a rate of one per 18-20 packs. What's interesting is the very last line, which Redditor Czhihong translated to, "actual odds of getting better quality cards will increase in tandem as players open more packs." That would seemingly confirm the existence of the so-called "pity timer," which basically increases the odds of scoring a legendary the longer you go without one. The existence of the pity timer isn't a secret by any stretch, but it's still nice to have it and the drop rates, officially confirmed—even if, as with Overwatch, we can't be absolutely certain that the same rates apply outside of China. Now if someone could only do something about pulling the Paladin Quest twice in a row.

NB: For inclusion into this article, studies recording the rarity drops of card packs should have a reasonably large sample size and should have a citable reference from a reputable source.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.    Expansion  Cards  Card count  Percentage of total   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  61,795  44,146  14,083  2,823  743  71.44%  22.79%  4.57%  1.20%   Goblins vs Gnomes*  2,000  1,419  462  97  22  70.95%  23.10%  4.85%  1.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  54,271  17,276  3,232  766  71.84%  22.87%  4.28%  1.01%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  4,030  1,284  256  60  71.58%  22.81%  4.55%  1.07%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  4,805  1,556  299  70  71.40%  23.12%  4.44%  1.04%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  8,419  2,694  538  134  71.44%  22.86%  4.57%  1.14%   Knights of the Frozen Throne*  1,900  1,361  441  80  18  71.63%  23.21%  4.21%  0.95%   Total for all expansions   163,485  117,090  37,355  7,245  1,795  71.62%  22.85%  4.43%  1.10%  * Note that the sample size for Goblins vs Gnomes & Knights of the Frozen Throne are probably too small to be statistically relevant.  Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs. (For readability, the totals and the percentages are split over two separate tables):    Expansion  Cards  Number of regular  Number of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615  1,853  835  780  175  63   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  1,934  1,390  432  92  20  66  29  30  5  2   The Grand Tournament  75,545  73,266  53,151  16,319  3,086  710  2,279  1,120  957  146  56   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  5,443  3,939  1,209  241  54  187  91  75  15  6   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  6,502  4,694  1,464  282  62  228  111  92  17  8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  11,380  8,236  2,516  506  122  405  183  178  32  12   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  1,837  1,333  413  75  16  63  28  28  5  2   Total for all expansions   158,485  153,467  111,156  34,088  6,640  1,583  5,018  2,369  2,112  390  147    Expansion  Cards  Percentage of regular  Percentage of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  96.70%  69.50%  21.60%  4.60%  1.00%  3.30%  1.45%  1.50%  0.25%  0.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  96.98%  70.36%  21.60%  4.08%  0.94%  3.02%  1.48%  1.27%  0.19%  0.07%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  96.68%  69.96%  21.47%  4.28%  0.96%  3.32%  1.62%  1.33%  0.27%  0.11%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  96.61%  69.75%  21.75%  4.19%  0.92%  3.39%  1.65%  1.37%  0.25%  0.12%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  96.56%  69.89%  21.35%  4.29%  1.04%  3.44%  1.55%  1.51%  0.27%  0.10%   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  96.69%  70.16%  21.74%  3.95%  0.84%  3.31%  1.47%  1.47%  0.26%  0.11%   Total for all expansions   158,485  96.83%  70.14%  21.51%  4.19%  1.00%  3.17%  1.49%  1.33%  0.25%  0.09%  Disregarding the data from GvG (which is statistically irrelevant because of the small sample size), it appears that the chance of receiving a golden common card has been slightly increased as of the Old Gods expansion, while simultaneously lowering the chance of a regular common card. In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.

According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes.

The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.

Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs.

In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.

Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs.

In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

[3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R.

September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.

Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs. (For readability, the totals and the percentages are split over two separate tables):    Expansion  Cards  Number of regular  Number of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615  1,853  835  780  175  63   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  1,934  1,390  432  92  20  66  29  30  5  2   The Grand Tournament  75,545  73,266  53,151  16,319  3,086  710  2,279  1,120  957  146  56   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  5,443  3,939  1,209  241  54  187  91  75  15  6   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  6,502  4,694  1,464  282  62  228  111  92  17  8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  11,380  8,236  2,516  506  122  405  183  178  32  12   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  1,837  1,333  413  75  16  63  28  28  5  2   Total for all expansions   158,485  153,467  111,156  34,088  6,640  1,583  5,018  2,369  2,112  390  147    Expansion  Cards  Percentage of regular  Percentage of golden   Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Total  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  96.70%  69.50%  21.60%  4.60%  1.00%  3.30%  1.45%  1.50%  0.25%  0.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  96.98%  70.36%  21.60%  4.08%  0.94%  3.02%  1.48%  1.27%  0.19%  0.07%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  96.68%  69.96%  21.47%  4.28%  0.96%  3.32%  1.62%  1.33%  0.27%  0.11%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  96.61%  69.75%  21.75%  4.19%  0.92%  3.39%  1.65%  1.37%  0.25%  0.12%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  96.56%  69.89%  21.35%  4.29%  1.04%  3.44%  1.55%  1.51%  0.27%  0.10%   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  96.69%  70.16%  21.74%  3.95%  0.84%  3.31%  1.47%  1.47%  0.26%  0.11%   Total for all expansions   158,485  96.83%  70.14%  21.51%  4.19%  1.00%  3.17%  1.49%  1.33%  0.25%  0.09%  Disregarding the data from GvG (which is statistically irrelevant because of the small sample size), it appears that the chance of receiving a golden common card has been slightly increased as of the Old Gods expansion, while simultaneously lowering the chance of a regular common card. In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

February 12, 2015: Amaz opens 400 GVG Packs [ edit | edit source ]  Sources: YouTube - Reddit   The average card's dust value is 21.22 dust. The average pack's dust value is 106.10.

The "tri-class bug" was a time when, during the opening day for Mean Streets of Gadgetzan , tri-class cards had a higher chance of being opened from packs than other cards. [19 ]  It is unknown whether the YouTube video catches all of the pack openings, since the raw data here was collected from the original Twitch VOD, and there were a lot of segues in-between pack openings, so the creator of the YouTube video might not have caught them all.

Millar opens 1256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs    6  References    Notes [ edit | edit source ]  All card packs guarantee a card of Rare or better rarity, among the 5 cards opened. [1 ] This means every card pack will guarantee having at least one card of Rare/Epic/Legendary rarity, or in other words, all 5 cards will never be all of Common rarity. [2 ]  All types of card pack have the same chances at rarities and golden cards . [3 ] [4 ] [5 ]  Opening 100 packs from an expansion set is roughly equivalent to obtaining 75% of the cards in that set. [6 ]  100 packs is approximately (98/98) Commons, (64/72) Rares, (20/54) Epics, and (4.5/20) Legendaries (taking Mean Streets of Gadgetzan as the example set ). [7 ]  According to the meta-study data in this article from 2015, the average number of packs to open before receiving another Legendary card is 18.  Cards are decided during the opening of packs, not during the moment of purchase. [8 ]  A case has been made for "predetermined rarities" when opening packs "again". [9 ] This probably means that Hearthstone uses some method of seeding that allows it to determine the rarities of a player's future cards well in advance, and snapshots of the seeding progress are cached periodically server-side as a back-up mechanism in case of a system or database failure, as is what happened in China.  A true Hearthstone pack opening simulator cannot be created unless the source code is revealed. (See Discussion ) However, using the data showing the probability percentages of opening cards belonging to each rarity type, a user-generated "pack opening" simulator can be created. Employing Monte Carlo repeated simulation of such pack openings can yield information as to the average number of "missing" and "extra" cards a player may receive from opening "n" packs. Information as to the amount of dust obtained from disenchanting all "extra" cards obtained from such packs can also be obtained.  Other simulators may base their simulation on guesses as to how individual cards are selected to be opened from the card pool. The raw data obtained from this article can be used to either debunk or verify such hypothetical user-generated pack opening simulators.  As seen with the Tri-class card opening bug on December 1, 2016, in which Tri-class cards had a higher than normal chance of appearing in packs, there appears to be a card-opening variable based on " Classes ".  China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone . [10 ]  Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums. [11 ] [12 ] The officially announced drop rates are:  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.   EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.   LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.  Changes to pack opening logic, starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne (2017-06-22).  On June 22nd, 2017, Blizzard announced in a blog post several changes in pack openings that would take effect when the next expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne , released on August 10th, 2017. The changes were described to affect packs of all future expansions: When opening a new Legendary , it will always be a Legendary you do not own yet, unless you already own all Legendaries from that set. This mechanism does not distinguish between normal and golden cards.   Example: You own a golden Ysera . You will not find any Ysera (golden or non-golden) in any future Classic pack, until you own at least one copy of all Legendaries from the Classic set. After that, you may find another Ysera, which may or may not be golden.  A card pack will never include more copies of a single card than what may be used in a deck. In other words, there will never be three or more copies of a single Common , Rare , or Epic card, though you might still find two copies of a card that you already own one or more copies of. Once you have all Legendaries from a set, this same guarantee should also ensure that you do not get more than one copy of the same Legendary in a single pack.  When opening packs from a new set, at least one Legendary is now guaranteed within the first 10 packs. This is most likely achieved by initializing the Pity Timer to 30 for each new set.  The first two changes should not include the overall distribution of cards in packs; the last change will result in a small increase of the number of Legendaries. The relative increase will be higher for players opening few packs, and lower as a player opens more packs from the same set. [13 ]  Pity Timer [ edit | edit source ]  There is strong evidence that a "Pity Timer" exists, which defines a maximum number of packs that a player opens before guaranteeing the next Rare/Epic/Legendary card. [14 ] [15 ] This Pity Timer counter is tracked individually for each store-bought expansion set, including Classic set .  An Epic card will be opened within 10 packs of the last opened Epic, for that set. [14 ]  A Legendary card will be opened within 40 packs of the last opened Legendary, for that set.  Pitytracker.com has also compiled their own card pack opening statistics for each expansion : pitytracker.com/insights .  Expected dust value [ edit | edit source ]  According to the below meta-study's data tabulated under the "Golden cards" section, the average card pack has a disenchanting value of 102.71 Arcane Dust . [16 ] Each card has an average disenchanting value of 20.54 Arcane Dust.  Meta-study [ edit | edit source ]  The following numbers combine data from several other studies on this page. Since it has at times been suggested that the distribution of cards has changed over time or is different for different expansions, the numbers are shown per expansion. Note that all data collection has been done for each expansion when it was the most recent expansion, so there is for example no data available for card distribution in Classic packs that were openend after the release of Goblins vs Gnomes. Currently included studies:  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz (1,000 Classic Packs)  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren (11,359 Classic Packs)  February 12, 2015: Amaz (400 GvG Packs)  August 29, 2015: HearthSim (15,109 TGT Packs)  April 28, 2016: Kripparian (713 Old Gods Packs)  April 28, 2016: Amaz (413 Old Gods Packs)  December 1, 2016: Kripparian (896 Gadgetzan Packs, Before Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  December 1-2, 2016: Kripparian (450 Gadgetzan Packs, After Tri-Class Bug Hotfix)  April 6, 2017: Kripparian (1,101 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  April 8, 2017: N. Millar (1,256 Journey to Un'Goro Packs)  This produces a total sample size of 32,697 card packs, describing 163,485 cards in total.  September 13, 2017: Joe Tweak (380 Knights of the Frozen Throne Packs)  Rarity distribution [ edit | edit source ]  This table shows the likelihood of any single card being of a given rarity. The differences in the percentages appear to be all within the boundaries of statistical variance. This suggests that, at least up to and including the Un'Goro expansion, there have been no changes in the distribution of cards per rarity.    Expansion  Cards  Card count  Percentage of total   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  61,795  44,146  14,083  2,823  743  71.44%  22.79%  4.57%  1.20%   Goblins vs Gnomes*  2,000  1,419  462  97  22  70.95%  23.10%  4.85%  1.10%   The Grand Tournament  75,545  54,271  17,276  3,232  766  71.84%  22.87%  4.28%  1.01%   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  4,030  1,284  256  60  71.58%  22.81%  4.55%  1.07%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  4,805  1,556  299  70  71.40%  23.12%  4.44%  1.04%   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  8,419  2,694  538  134  71.44%  22.86%  4.57%  1.14%   Knights of the Frozen Throne*  1,900  1,361  441  80  18  71.63%  23.21%  4.21%  0.95%   Total for all expansions   163,485  117,090  37,355  7,245  1,795  71.62%  22.85%  4.43%  1.10%  * Note that the sample size for Goblins vs Gnomes & Knights of the Frozen Throne are probably too small to be statistically relevant.  Due to how cards are generated (with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better in any pack, plus the existence of a "Pity timer" for Epic and Legendary cards), the chance of finding at least one card of any given rarity can not simply mathematically be computed from the numbers above. However, for all pack openings since the TGT expansion the card rarities in any individual pack have been recorded. With these data, it is possible to determine the chances for these events:    Expansion  Packs  Packs with at least one  Probability of at least one   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   The Grand Tournament  15,109  15,106  14,480  3,073  760  99.98%  95.84%  20.34%  5.03%   Whispers of the Old Gods  1,126  1,126  1,067  241  60  100.00%  94.76%  21.40%  5.33%   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  1,346  1,346  1,284  286  70  100.00%  95.39%  21.25%  5.20%   Journey to Un'Goro  2,357  2,355  2,241  500  132  99.92%  95.08%  21.21%  5.60%   Knights of the Frozen Throne   No data available yet    Total for all expansions   19,938  19,933  19,072  4,100  1,022  99.97%  95.66%  20.56%  5.13%  Golden cards [ edit | edit source ]  The data from Marinconz does not include details of regular vs. golden opened in the packs. However, all other studies did include this data. After excluding the 5,000 cards from Marinconz' study, this results in the following probabilities of finding regular or golden cards of any rarity when opening packs.

In other words, the chance of a common is unchanged, but any common card generated has an increased chance to be golden. A different way to look at the data is to compute, for any given rarity, the ratio of regular versus golden cards. This is shown in the next table:    Expansion  Cards  Percentage golden  Probability golden   Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Classic  56,795  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8   Goblins vs Gnomes  2,000  2.04%  6.49%  5.15%  9.09%  1 in 48.9  1 in 15.4  1 in 19.4  1 in 11.0   The Grand Tournament  75,545  2.06%  5.54%  4.52%  7.31%  1 in 48.5  1 in 18.1  1 in 22.1  1 in 13.7   Whispers of the Old Gods  5,630  2.26%  5.84%  5.86%  10.00%  1 in 44.3  1 in 17.1  1 in 17.1  1 in 10.0   Mean Streets of Gadgetzan  6,730  2.31%  5.91%  5.69%  11.43%  1 in 43.3  1 in 16.9  1 in 17.6  1 in 8.8   Journey to Un'Goro  11,785  2.17%  6.61%  5.95%  8.96%  1 in 46.0  1 in 15.1  1 in 16.8  1 in 11.2   Knights of the Frozen Throne  1,900  2.10%  6.78%  6.67%  12.50%  1 in 47.6  1 in 14.7  1 in 15.0  1 in 8   Total for all expansions   158,485  2.09%  5.83%  5.55%  8.50%  1 in 47.9  1 in 17.1  1 in 18.0  1 in 11.8  This data again shows the increased chance of a Common card being golden since the Old Gods expansion.
The seemingly erratic changes in the chance of a Legendary card being golden are probably a result of the relatively low amount of legendaries in the data, making the data statistically less trustworthy. However, it cannot be ruled out that the rules for generating a Legendary as golden or regular have been changed by Blizzard.  Class distribution [ edit | edit source ]  Only a single data set (the HearthSim data) tracked the class of the cards openend in addition to their rarity. Fortunately, this data set by itself is large enough for statistical relevant. However, this obviously means that there is no way to verify whether there have been changes in distribution across the classes over time, and whether the same pattern applies for expansions other than TGT. The table below shows, per rarity and by class, the average number of times each card was opened. (Example: A total of 3,227 Common Mage cards were openened; since the TGT expansion includes 3 Common Mage cards the average number per card is 1,075.67).    Class  Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Druid  1,106.00  486.33  123.50  28.00   Hunter  1,092.67  498.00  118.00  38.00   Mage  1,075.67  493.00  127.50  32.00   Paladin  1,082.67  486.67  113.50  51.00   Priest  1,118.33  475.67  117.50  28.00   Rogue  1,116.33  491.33  126.00  28.00   Shaman  1,134.00  469.00  125.50  30.00   Warlock  1,098.67  482.33  122.00  47.00   Warrior  1,114.67  472.33  116.50  34.00   Neutral  1,111.55  468.00  116.89  41.20  The variations in the numbers are all within the boundaries of expected statistical variance. This suggests that the pack opening algorithm does not favor any specific class, nor neutral cards over class-speecific cards. However, that does not mean that there is an equal chance of finding any class or neutral; it means that any card of a given rarity is equally likely to be found. Since TGT (like all other expansions) has more neutral cards than it has class-specific cards, the chance of getting a neutral card is still higher.  Data [ edit | edit source ]  June 5, 2014: Steve Marinconz [ edit | edit source ]  On June 5th 2014 Steve Marinconz published the following results in an article on Kotaku.com. [17 ] The data was collected by aggregating the results of numerous card pack opening videos found online, with a total of 1,000 packs. The study used only videos filmed in the last two months.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Count per 1,000 packs  3,565  1,155  215  65   Percentage of total  71.30%  23.10%  4.30%  1.30%   Probability of at least 1 per pack *    99.81% *    73.11% *    19.73% *    6.33% *   * NOTE: The data in this row is as published in the article, but appears to be incorrect. According to these numbers, the chance of finding at least one Rare or better card in a pack is (73.11 + 19.73 + 6.33) = 99.17%, which is inconsistent with the guarantee of at least one Rare or better card. Apparently Marinconz computed these figures from the "Percentage of total" chances, based on the assumption of a flat distribution; however the "at least 1 Rare or better" guarantee invalidates this assumption and hence these numbers.  Based upon this data, Marinconz provided some interesting 'fun facts'. While these are based on the results of this single, relatively small study, the closeness of the study's results to those of other and larger studies suggests that the below information should still be relatively accurate, at least for the lower rarities.  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million  The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion  There's a 0.04% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack  The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80%  There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card  Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were  The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust  The most common distribution was a '4100' - 4 commons and 1 rare - accounting for 61% of packs opened  The second most common distribution was a '3200' - 3 commons and 2 rares - accounting for 12.2% of packs opened  Unfortunately, Marinconz only posted aggregated data. Without data about individual packs, it is not possible to use this data for the "Probability of at least 1 per pack" table in the Meta-study. Also, since Steve didn't publish the exact number of golden cards, this study has also been excluded from any of the tables representing the chance of golden cards.  August 2014: E. R. Kjellgren [ edit | edit source ]  In August 2014 E. R. Kjellgren published an investigation into the rarities of cards found in card packs. [18 ] This was achieved by collecting user data from forums regarding the contents of 11,359 different card packs. The author notes that the investigation suffered from two main problems: the information collected was anonymous and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed; and the sample size, while adequate for the lower rarities, is still smaller than might be desired for the higher rarities. Kjellgren also divided rarities into golden and regular versions. Based on the data below, the average card's dust value is 21.51 dust. The average pack's dust value is 107.54.   Percentage of total      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  71.45%  22.76%  4.59%  1.19%   Regular  96.74%  69.98%  21.39%  4.28%  1.08%   Golden  3.26%  1.47%  1.37%  0.31%  0.11%   Count per 11,359 packs       Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary     All  40,581  12,928  2,608  678   Regular  54,942  39,746  12,148  2,433  615   Golden  1,853  835  780  175  63  The data showed golden cards to be on average around 30 times less common than regular cards. However, the proportion of golden and regular versions varied substantially by rarity. The author also notes that the sample sizes for the higher golden rarities are too small to be considered conclusive.      Common  Rare  Epic  Legendary   Percentage golden  2.06%  6.03%  6.71%  9.29%   Rough probability  1 in 48.6  1 in 16.6  1 in 14.9  1 in 10.8  Unfortunately, Kjellgren only posted aggregated data.

If I craft a golden legendary, does that prevent me from getting the non golden version of it? Cuz I happened to get a normal Leeroy despite having a golden copy a while back. I have since dusted the normal card but I feel like it shouldn't have been intended. 2. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the more legendaries I amass, the less likely I am to hit another legendary upon opening packs. My speculation is that it might be possible that the code (or whatever it is that dictates the odds of me getting a legendary) does not roll a legendary card before rolling again to randomise which legendary card I get. What I am saying is that, you roll the chances of getting a specific card, that's it. When it should be the case that you should roll the chance of getting a certain combination of rarities and then proceed to roll from the pool of each rarity, the card within that rarity. If the system uses the former method of operating, does this mean that once I happen to roll to a duplicate legendary, it will be cancelled and re-rolled to another card, severely crippling the chances of me getting another legendary as a result of me coincidentally owning the originally rolled legendary?            rabb1t MVP - Hearthstone   21705 posts    rabb1t Ignored       Aug 15  -2    Copy URL     View Post   08/14/2017 09:12 PM Posted by SkyaSh 2.

My speculation is that it might be possible that the code (or whatever it is that dictates the odds of me getting a legendary) does not roll a legendary card before rolling again to randomise which legendary card I get. This happens in any loot system. You have none of x - you need 20 of 100. You get some... You have some and need 10 of 100. Your chance is now much less than half of the original chance. (Yes, the percentage of the whole is 50%, but that's not how drawing 1 out of x pool works.) So yes, your chances of getting one are dropping, because the chance that one appears you don't have is becoming lower and lower as you get more. Is the code doing this? No. The base math of fewer of X in Y total pool does this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient            Holy   265 posts    Holy Ignored       Aug 15     Copy URL     View Post   Well blizzard was forced to admit to the average drop chance of a legendary cards because of chinas laws.

There are diminishing returns, overall, based on how many cards from said collection you have. As example... You have 10 cards of a 250 card collection. You buy 10 boosters. Odds are good to high you'll see cards you don't yet have. (Of any rarity.) vs. You have 200 cards of a 250 card collection. You buy 10 boosters. Odds are extremely low (towards approaching zero for some rarities) that you'll see new cards. Way back in the beta wipe I kind of kept mental track. It was at about 50 boosters that your odds of seeing new cards extremely dropped off. I was seeing about 1 card or less that I didn't have in boosters beyond that point. At 100+ opened it's almost impossible to get new cards from the booster. It's the same thing with loot if you've ever played any loot based game. You try and collect x set. As you get more pieces, the chance of a piece dropping you don't have from any given run diminishes because you have many of the pieces already.

Guess I won't try again though. Edit: I feel like I should try again for the OP. Won't waste my time putting in all the evidence again though: 1) yes 2) no. Having legendaries does not decrease your chance for more legendaries. How you describe it in your third paragraph is already how it works.

So lets say from the KnC set, the only legendaries I don't have are sonya, ixlid and katherina. If I were to craft sonya, would that decrease the odds of me getting a legendary (either ixlid or katherina in this case) from my next KnC pack compared to the odds beforehands me crafting Sonya?

Bug forums is not for asking questions. Next time ask in any of the discussion forums. As it stands, chance would not change at all. The only difference would be that Sonya would no longer be available as drop from the packs.                   Join the Conversation        Ignored    Have something to say?

What was implemented was a guarantee of a legendary at specific points. You will get a Legendary in your first 10 packs ever for an expansion. This means that your 10th pack will give you a Legendary for sure, if you didn't get any in your first 9. This does NOT mean you have a better chance of getting on in the first 9 than you did before, only that you will absolutely get one in the 10th. After that, you get one every 40 packs at worst. This means that if you have bad luck, your legendary cards can come at: Pack 10 Pack 50 Pack 90 Pack 130 etc. The only difference between now and before is that before you could go all 130 packs without getting a single legendary.

If a card is rolled on, the put in your pack, then has to pass a check to see if it's golden, the odds are the same no matter what, as long as there's a legendary in there.

They get to keep their regular version and craft another unowned legendary with the dust from the golden copy, whereas the collector gets to craft an epic from their dusted version. For me it works well, I usually know most of the cards I want in gold before the expansion launches, so it gives me the freedom to craft them before opening any packs and have a guarantee of no dupes, but there are certainly positives and negatives with this change. 06/22/2017 05:41 PM Posted by Mercutio Is that actually true?

Yes: Starting with the release of Hearthstone’s next expansion (but applying to ALL Hearthstone card packs), every time you open a Legendary in a card pack, it will be a Legendary card from the same set that you don’t already own. Once you own either the golden or non-golden version of a Legendary card, you won’t get a duplicate of it until you own all the Legendary cards from that set. Soon, you’ll be able to craft a Legendary without the worry of opening it in your next few packs!

A legendary in my two favorite decks, Elemental Shaman and Miracle Rogue, I opened as Golden. With that said this is still a positive change for the community as a whole. Will it cost me more to make a few Golden Legendary cards for my favorite classes? Yes; however, I prefer changes that are healthy for the community and this change is a POSITIVE one.            foxtrotter   92 posts    foxtrotter Ignored       Jun 23  (Edited)  -2    Copy URL     View Post   06/22/2017 06:10 PM Posted by Lykotic however, I prefer changes that are healthy for the community and this change is a POSITIVE one. I feel you there. Another positive change, that I would personally like to see, is Class Specific card packs. Also, a Marketplace to send all my Shaman, Priest, Warlock cards to, so others who like to play those cards, can send me their Warrior, Rogue, Hunter cards they don't play with, and we can finally have Trading in this card game. With the new system of Legendaries being opened in packs, I'll have to keep the Legendaries I don't use, as a placeholder in all those classes I don't play, losing the opportunity cost of the dust I could have, just so I don't get them AGAIN, until the point comes a year from now, when I have collected all the Legendaries. Only then can I dust the ones I don't use.            Tao   1082 posts    Tao Ignored       Jun 23  (Edited)  4    Copy URL     View Post   Let's look at the math here. Assuming that there are 21 legendaries in the expac, and you have a 1/13 chance at getting a golden on your next legendary. How many packs do you need to open to get what you want? Well, it depends on what you want. If you want to open one of each legendary, it'll currently take ~1540 packs.  (That's 20 packs per legendary,  and 77 legendaries to get one of each https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem) In those 1540 packs, to go with your 56 duplicates you will likely have found 6 golden Legendaries. Under the new setup, it'll take 420 packs to get a complete collection, and you will probably have found 2 goldens. If you are wanting a specific golden legendary, you are looking at odds of 1/273 (1/21 x 1/13) or 0.3663% each time your pity timer is up. Currently that number is consistent. Under the new plan it would be 0.3663% of getting it on your first legendary of the expac (first 10 packs) and, each time you open a legendary that isn't the one that you want, your odds improve for the next roll to 0.3846% (1/20 x 1/13, for legendary number two) increasing each time you open a different legendary up to 7.69% (1/13)if its your last one, or until you get it non golden whereupon yes, your odds drop to 0 for the next 21-N legendaries, when it bounces back to 0.3663% So perhaps a better title for this thread would be "Odds fluctuate +7.3% -0.3% for finding unique golden legendary."

As much as I'd like to see this, I think this would be an exploitable system. Because anyone could set up as many accounts as they'd like and do as many quests as they can to buy a lot of packs with gold and trade the cards to their main account. One way around this, would be changing the system of buying cards and card packs. They could make a market place in which you can buy cards with gold only and packs can only be bought with real money (which would anger a lot of players and rightly so). Also they could restrict trading to "a card for a card" but then you'd have to ensure that the value of the cards is at least roughly equal. I mean even if you say that rarity is the deciding factor (meaning you can only trade commons for commons, rares for rares and so on) there still are cards that in their bracket that are worth more than others. Or would anyone care to trade Ysera for Milhouse Manastorm? So all in all, I don't think we'll se a trading system in Hearthstone, because it's either prone for misuse or the necessary changes would alienate players.

Someone knows what is it? I checked but numbers are old and not the same depending on the site. In my last 47 packs (15 Whispers, 15 Classics, 15 Grand Tournament bought, and 2 bought with gold), I got 6 ledendary, 2 of them golden (Malygos and King Krush), It struck me as almost unbelievable. I play since a year and had not yet to see a Golden Legendary and now 2 in a row? Something's happening? Am I the only one?

Wherever I looked it said it is around 1% per card or 5% per pack (and from my longtime experience it is not that far off). A reason you might experience these cluster is you buying different sorts of packs. If your pity timer was already up with those you might have had a bigger chance for one legendary in each of them and then just got lucky to draw the other 3. Even if it was not the pity timer 47 packs is no sample size at all in matter of statistics and it's "only" 255% of the expected amount of packs.

Like if it is a while since I draw a legendary, I'm due, and I was probably was due for all sorts of packs? And also, the odds are not for all packs, but for different sorts of pack?

GFoldem   777 posts    GFoldem Ignored       Nov 14, 2016  1    Copy URL     View Post   The pity timer was never confirmed but is very likely. In short you start a a chance of slightly below 5% with the first pack of a kind opened and it increases slightly at first and steeper at later stages to 100% at (suspected) 40th pack to be at around 5% for the average pack. This counter of packs without legendary is stored for every kind of pack (classic, tgt, wog) separate.

If there actually is a pity timer, I haven't seen any indication of it so far when buying packs with gold. I consider myself lucky though to ever have drawn any legendaries with gold packs. If I was on the Blizzard staff, I wouldn't give these complaining, free players squat.

However, I've seen no difference between real money or gold. Of my 47 packs, 45 were money bought, and 2 gold bought. I got golden Malygos in a gold bought one. And on the first pack you get when you join, I got Malygos non golden, I got Tirion in a Tavern Brawl pack, Yogg in a 0-3 Arena pack, etc. Guess I'm just lucky, but I mean I don't see any difference between the 2 ways to purchase.

This was my 90 packs of gadgetzan (bought with gold, although i doubt it matters): 4 legendaries, first one at ~36 or 37 packs in (Sally), 2nd and 3rd at roughly 20 and 18 packs to go (Aya and Warlock legendary), last one at 6 packs to go (Don). As you can see, i almost ran into the pity timer with 2 of my streaks. In short: I think you just got extremely lucky within your 47 pack spree.            Miro   5 posts    Miro Ignored       Dec 9, 2016  (Edited)  -1    Copy URL     View Post   I had 56 packs of MSOG, 50 bought as pre-purchase and another 6 from ingame quests and I got only 1 legendary card (0.35% drop rate). Three of my friends got 10 packs each (6 from quests and 4 bought by ingame gold) and all of them got 2 legendaries. So I don't know if there was some Blizzard's problem when I was opening my packs or what happened, but 0.35% drop rate is really ridiculous for me and I don't think I will ever buy packs for real money. Plus the problem with tri-class drop rate is not helping me to believe Blizzard has everything under control.

Well, I don't think this is within realms of expectation, when normally there is about 1 - 2% drop rate. This is at least 3 times less then the lower rate is and about 5 times less then the average. And I wasn't compensated, because I didn't open any pack before the hotfix.

Blizzard did mention the chance of receiving Legendary is 1 in 20, or about 5%, as you stated. Data collected over time says that due to randomness, there's a hidden "pity timer" that keeps track the last time you've received a Legendary for a specific set. The data compiled shown that the highest number of packs you can go without a single Legendary is 39, with the 40th guaranteeing you one; thus, bringing the percentage up to 2.5% at worst. What does this mean? It means that if you hope to get Legendaries from a specific set, buying batches in multiples of 40 will do it. In 56 packs, it is possible to receive only one Legendary. It is also conjectured that the same happens to Epics in multiples of 10. In 56 packs, you should have received at least 5 Epics as well, in theory.

I play since a year and had not yet to see a Golden Legendary and now 2 in a row? Something's happening? Am I the only one? You got lucky...

I don't have the data published to the site yet, but in those 12k arena drafts the chance of getting a legendary on a given pick is just under 1% (~.86%). And ~22% of arenas have at least one legendary. The numbers for epics are about a 3.5% chance per pick with about 63% of arenas having at least one. Obviously this data is all manually entered, so it's not scientific fact and should be taken with a grain of salt. But nonetheless it is probably a pretty solid data point about the frequency of legendaries.            firerider   466 posts    firerider Ignored       Mar 14, 2014  (Edited)     Copy URL     View Post   03/14/2014 01:39 PM Posted by elias I built Arena Mastery, which has about ~12,000 decks tracked (when I checked these numbers last week).

Chances of 2 legends are roughly 22.8%^2 = 5.19% (This calculation is for simplicity. If someone would develop an accurate formula here that would be great). Chance of 3 legends are 22.8%^3 = 1.18%. Chances of 4 are 22.8%^4 = 0.27%. Think we can stop here. EV(legend) = 1*0.228 + 2*0.0519 + 3*0.0118 + 4* 0.0027= 0.378 legend/arena Will do the Epics later. Do we have values for rares?

Around 4% odds to get 1 or less legendary pick in 20 arenas. Around 1/27000 odds to not get offered an epic in 10 arenas. That's not too bad I guess, feels pretty bad playing like rogue and seeing an epic pick - you know you either get a dead card or a really situational card at best. Unless you get lucky and get offered that only neutral epic card that's actually very good. It is druid where you like seeing epic picks and fine in pally/shaman/warrior, everything else has only 1 good/fine class epic and pretty rare to get it over all the bad epics.            justinckoh   1 posts    justinckoh Ignored       May 10, 2015  1    Copy URL     View Post   Not to make you feel bad, but I just got 3 legendaries for my arena deck.

I've completed about 40 wins at this level now, and I've never seen more than a golden rare... I don't understand, am I doing something wrong? You're not doing anything wrong. The probability of getting at least one legendary out of 40 card rewards is only slightly higher than 35%, pretty close in probability compared to opening 40 cards from 8 packs. That's is for categorical: common, rare, epic, legendary distribution. The expected number of legendaries in 40 cards is only around 0.43 However, rolling categorical: golden or not golden... that's completely different from pack distributions. Empirically, the 8+ reward card being golden instead of normal is close to 62.5%, much much higher compared to packs.

Anyway, by chinese and south Korean new laws, the comapny had to open this info to the public, confirming both drop rates we had so far + the pitty timer. All games: Hearthstone: Each card pack will have at least one Rare or higher card Approximately one in five packs will have an Epic card Approximately one in 20 packs will have a Legendary card Overwatch: Each loot box will contain at least one Rare item An Epic item will appear once every 5.5 loot boxes, on average A Legendary item will appear once every 13.5 loot boxes, on average Heroes of the Storm: Every loot chest will contain, on average, 2.9 regular items and one rare item Epic items will appear once per 4.5 loot boxes, on average Legendary items will appear once every 17.5 loot boxes, on average The so-called "pity timer" also appears to be in effect for Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, . It will guarantee a Legendary drop if you haven't  opened one in 39 packs from the same set (e.g. Clasic, UnGoro, etc). The pity timer goes to 0 whenever a legendary is oppened Edited: The part about the pity timer and crafting as it is only speculated about.            kyross   219 posts    kyross Ignored       19 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   19/07/2017 12:06 Posted by Azra The pity timer goes to 0 whenever a legendary is crafted Really ?

That would pretty drastically change my usual pack opening / card crafting strategy, so it would be great to know if that happens to be true Actually it is unclear, as it's hard to predict when you will open a legend exactly. Both WoW and D3 have pitty timer on legendaries and ancient ones (D3). In WoW the pitty timer on drops is unnafected by crafting. In D3, you have a 1 in 10 pitty timer on all legend/set items (seems to be in 1 game sesion so far) so if you transmute into legendaries 10 items, 1 (usually the 10th, lol) is with ancient quality. And it resets the pitty timer both on drops and crafted items. Here is the info source http://hs.blizzard.cn/articles/20/9546 It doesnt state the word "pitty" and "timer", but what else could it be. Anyway, crafting after getting a legendary from a pack is wise, as you guarantee it will not be a dupe (which will not be a concern after the exp hits) and you have the chance to save some dust as you can open exatcly what you want. Btw, there seems to be decraese in golden cards drop rates, since the chest reward update was introduced.

If so, can you get 3 legendaries in 4 packs? (someone complained about getting 3 Sylvanas in 4 packs a while ago so I do not know what to believe) or is no more than 1 in 20 and 1 in 5 there is a pity timer for legendaries you said, but is there a pity timer for epics? I happened to open 8 packs in the last 3 days and the first 7 were 4 common 1 rare while the last one was 3 common 1 rare 1 epic, I haven't got a legendary in a while and the last epic was about I'd estimate 6 packs before that 8 packs (it takes me some time to get packs as I tend to play arena for packs so I may recycle the gold) and also there is there only one pity timer for all sets or 1 for each card set that doesn't reset whit the opening of a new legendary? If you could give me a link or something, please excuse my lack of understanding but I tend to make lists and keep track of events and that turns me more or less in a perfectionist            Vlad   3449 posts    Vlad Ignored       19 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   1 in 5 and 1 in 20 are averages.

This is from months ago. Even though not officially confirmed the pity timers are 40 for legendaries, 10 for epics, are set specific and have nothing to do with crafting. For KFT it's almost certain they won't change any of the drop rates, but if they do you'll know within hours of it launching, just like the tri-class card debacle with MSG. Too many people collecting stats for them to pull a fast one.            Azra   2081 posts    Azra Ignored       20 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   20/07/2017 00:06 Posted by Ixnay ..just?

Yes,  - the law just passed in SK, and the numbers are the same as those in china => so this confirms the numbers :) 20/07/2017 00:06 Posted by Ixnay Even though not officially confirmed run this trough google translate 此外，需要说明的是：随着卡牌包抽取数量的增多，玩家实际获得高品质卡牌的概率也将同步提高。            Ixnay   1594 posts    Ixnay Ignored       20 Jul     Copy URL     View Post   Ah, your sentence made it sound like the Chinese laws were new instead of 3 months old when Blizzard originally post the exact same figures. Google translate: In addition, it should be noted that: with the number of cards to increase the number of packages, players actually get high-quality card card probability will also increase. So I repeat no official confirmation of the pity timer. I do seem to recall someone accidentally saying that the 50 pack pre-order guarentees at least 2 legendaries (ie 10 pity time > 40 pity timer) so everyone knows it but it wouldn't surprise me if the legal team / complaints team don't want it officaialised just due to the number of false "I went 41 packs without a legend" messages they'd have to deal with.

And it resets the pitty timer both on drops and crafted items. I'm 99% sure its not true. The AVERAGE chance for ancient is 10%, so having a pity timer equal the average would make 0 sense. Also I'm pretty sure I had reforges that ran more than 10, even in my very limited sample size. The legendary drop pity timer in diablo has been time-based before (and I doubt it ever changed), where as time passes without getting any legedaries, drop chances from monsters increases. Unless the timer has been changed (it was in the range of hour(s)), it is never triggering nowadays, when you get legendaries left and right. Yet this diablo pity timer is actually the one that gave the concept its name (it certainly doesn't make much sense to call it 'timer' in hearthstone and would be more accurate as 'counter'). I was recording the results of all my pack openings for last 2 expansions now and so far the community implied pity timers for epic, legendary, golden common and golden rare seem to be correct (never went over and had multiple close calls). I haven't gotten close to the timer on golden epic and haven't gotten a single golden legendary at all in those packs (noone ever opened enough packs of a single expansion to provide any data towards the pity timer on golden legendary).

Point is, 10% on avg doesnt guarantte an ancient in 10 drops. you could get 3 at drops 18/23/29 from 30 -thats why the pitty timer :) Or you can get 3 ancients in 3 drops and then have none to 30. To avoid such situation u have the pitty timer. Same as in HS. You have less then 2% chance to get a legendary that increases to ~30% at 20 packs oppened and then goes up to 100% at your 40th pack, So - pitty timer that matches the chance ;). Agre on the rest, gave diablo only as example, the legend drops there are much different then those in HS, you have much more (less chance to lend the right one for your build) and each stat is rolled from a pool of stats - what it will be and what is it range, so you need much more drops, but at the end it feels the sam (6 weeks without finding ancient Focus/Restrain combo with sockets and proper stats FEELS BAD MAN!!)

That's what I'm saying, I'm pretty sure there is no pity timer for ancients in diablo, or at least it certainly is not 10 - you could as easily get a dry run of 20. An average of 10% and pity timer at 10 would only be possible if you ALWAYS got it on 10th, as every drop before 10 would push the average above 10%; and I'm pretty sure I've seen at least one blizzard official post stating that ancient rate is 10%, not to mention unofficial statistics confirming that. (For example: 10, 10, 10, 10, 5 makes it 11.11% average and you can't bring it down ever, since you cant add anything over 10 - I hope you see here why a 10% average with 10th guaranteed drop is simply impossible (unless its 10, 10, 10 ad infinitum, which is not the case). So summing it up, the pity timer (or guaranteed drop) has to always be higher than the average timer. In hearthstone its double the average, most likely making the median drop time of somewhere in the 3rd quartile (depending on the actual probability distribution).

I'm the most fun tryhard I know (I was playing mafia with a few friends and I was really passive aggressive (they liked it) even as a narator insulting (incognito) the girl who was medic 4 times in a row and healed herself every turn, also the reason I was top kill for everyone and if I didn't die first two turns I was the mafia, still had a good player friend to balance things up for me, point is we had fun altho I was an !@#) with twig I want some spell damage decks or just a full refresh since I have all the druid cards ever just by chance for voss I wanted to make a deck too but I really didn't have many tools for rogue and I gave up not wanting to spend my dust and with temporus (recently gotten) I was sure dissapointed as it all happened in less than less than a second, realizing it was orange while flipping it and then bam! the 400 dust, but I said a legendary is a legendary, my fortune is not to be ignored and inner fire priest can and will be sweet, still thinking of cards to work it with as I'd love to have 50 cards in the deck not 30, as always with priest            Sheercold   1969 posts    Sheercold Ignored       07 Feb     Copy URL     View Post   07/02/2018 18:44 Posted by ArthuRLaG in 30 packs of different sets, 10 each, you got no legendary, which has a chance of 1/2 3 times not stacking, you weren't guaranteed to get at least a legendary I know i was not guaranteed but still i think HS should be a lot more rewarding when it comes to packs and ladder. After opening 30 packs without a legendary you really lose the urge to play more. I am just sharing my experience others might feel different. I empathize with you now, my advice would be to get some more packs and open them one at a time cause now you have a higher chance to get legendaries, all my legendaries were by the pity timer and now if I opened 40 packs of wispers for example I could as well have only 1 legendary            ksdg   1258 posts    ksdg Ignored       07 Feb  (Edited)     Copy URL     View Post   yeah me too, had to resort to buying more packs from these sets 1 by 1 to hit that pity timer for the last time for these sets because these are the last packs ever I'll buy for these sets... unless another promotion like this happens which is unlikely. I think I spent about 3.5k gold before hitting all 3 legendaries. So more packs than bundle contained :) But at least I got about 8k dust.

Proper probability numbers are three non-stacking chances to get legendary with 1/4 (25%) probability. Well, if you want to get the probabilities straight, let's use the Grand Tournament Card Pack Opening and its 15'432 packs as a reference, since it's the basic reference when it comes to pity timer and legendary card opening statistics anyway. Considering he opened no legendary within 10 packs in each set, let's say his pity timers were anywhere between 0 and 29, and use the average legendary opening chance for each pack (the use of the average is relatively relevant due to said chance only significantly increasing beyond 30 packs). The average probability of opening a legendary in a pack with a 0 to 30 pity timer is 0.054155969. Considering 10 packs without a legendary, repeated thrice (one for each Mammuth set), the resulting probability is ((1-0.054155969)^10)^3 = 18.82% So, while not the most likely thing, opening a Mammuth Bundle and not receiving a legendary definitely isn't something impossible - especially considering the fact that the lower pity timer before the opening, the likelier it is to not get a single legendary Source: https://amp.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3zaeou/pity_timer_on_packs_opening_analysiskinda_proofed/            Xavathos   1086 posts    Xavathos Ignored       08 Feb  2    Copy URL     View Post   Because legendaries are the reason to buy packs, right?

Valuable cards. Right. You know what's valuable? Ice Block, Sea/Mountain Giant, Savannah Highmane, Firelands Portal, Dragonfire Potion, the list goes on. Notice how none of those are legendaries? Yet they make the decks powerful, moreso than any legendary ever would. Legendaries are the perfect cherry on top, but let's not forget the actual cake, shall we?

If i was to start HS now with the info i know now i would buy it maybe because i would get 3 legendaries guaranteed out of them. 1 out of forst 10 packs opened. So what are the odds after newbie legendary drop in first 10 packs for a legendary? What is a pity timer? Did you get no good usable cards out of it? In the info i read some epic cards are even better then legendary drops. I donot have the money for the mammoth bundle but for me as new player it sounds a good option to build collection. Wish my birthday was coming up as it would make a nice gift. Lol. Last question. As i read posts it sounds like if you get a legendary you can make a deck around it. Does that mean every legendary has a good deck possibility to build around? Or are there also support legendary? I mean i dusted milhouse and the steward guy as i couldnot see potential of these cards.

I've bought over 40 packets within the last 2 weeks and no legendaries at all, some golden cards but there usually just uncommon so not really worth that much disenchanting for dust. So yeah a small percentage in legendary drop chance would be appreciated or at least fix it so you're guaranteed a legendary after a certain amount of packs say like 30 since if you disenchanted all the cards from 30 packs assuming there all 1 rare and 4 commons you could make a legendary. Before anybody else says it, i don't think it should apply to packs bought with real money just ones you've bought with coins or earned playing the game.

You have a small chance of legendary in 1 pack, your chance increases as you open more of that type of pack. For example (not accurate numbers) 1% chance ->2nd pack of same type -> 2% chance. Etc until you get one and it resets. At 40 packs if you have not gotten a legendary you are GURENTEED one. So anyone complaining about only 1 legendary you just got unlucky. 1 legendary per 20 is the average. I also believe epics follow the same rule but for every 10. Could be wrong though.

For example (not accurate numbers) 1% chance ->2nd pack of same type -> 2% chance. Etc until you get one and it resets.

That's 9 legendaries in 196 packs. This is almost exactly the droprate from pre-MSoG packs. It looks like Blizzard did not change anything. I would also like to point out that I bought every single pack with ingame currency and apart from one early promotion card (golden Gelbin Mekkatorque) my account is 100% f2p. The packs I bought and dust I saved allow me to craft 2 legendaries of my choice in each region. I have two copies of most common and many rare cards, meaning I'll get my 40 dust from every pack now. Together with the reward at the end of the month that's almost one more legendary card that I can craft every month, just by doing my daily quests. And still, when I read the forum, I get the impression people are starving to death, plundered mercilessly by that greedy Blizzard capitalists.

I've been playing for more than 3 months now, opened god knows how much packs and haven't got a single legendary card, not once. I didn't count exactly, but I think I'm opening at least 4-5 packs a week in average and still nothing. Is that normal or just bad luck on my side?

Worth noting is that the pity timer tracks packs opened for each type individually, so in order to be guaranteed a Classic legendary you'll need to open 40 Classic packs, 20 Classic and 20 WotOG won't do it, however it'll grant you 50 % progress towards the guaranteed legendary for each of those 2 pack types.            davor992   2 posts    davor992 Ignored       08 May 2016     Copy URL     View Post   Looks like I'll keep waiting for the pity timer -.- Thanks :)            Zorth   1940 posts    Zorth Ignored       08 May 2016     Copy URL     View Post   08/05/2016 16:22 Posted by Marceronni You're guaranteed at least 1 legendary per 40 packs because of a 'pity timer'.

What I remember, getting legendaries from adventures was very helpful at start. Especially Emperor Thaurissan is invaluable and at the beginning, I was simply putting him into every deck I made. Now, half year later, I have all legendaries from available adventures and just very few from packs. If you want to have useful legendaries, either get them from adventures or craft them. That is what I do.            Vlad   3449 posts    Vlad Ignored       29 Mar 2017  1    Copy URL     View Post   Or play decks that don't evolve around legendaries. Pirate Warrior (urgh!) and Dragon Priest come to mind. Still quite a bit of adventures and crafting for the Dragon Priest deck though. And maybe it is a unpopular opinion but Ranked play is very competitive. Players with more resources will out value players will less resources down in the lower ranks so early on F2P players will likely be overrun by paying players. Rank 15 and up almost everyone has meta decks and it's skill from that point onwards. However it is possible. I have F2P colleagues that play for quite sometime and they build powerful tier 1 decks by opening packs, dusting and creating cards. It's a grind for them I admit, they told me that early on they had to put a lot of games up to get as many packs as possible but they became and are competitive and have fun. The difference between paying and not paying is how fast can we build meta decks and get over that Rank 15 threshold. From that moment on, money or not is, in my limited experience, less relevant.

But those numbers aren't actually useful for figuring out your chances of getting a legendary or golden card next time. If you aren't familiar with Hearthstone , it's a collectible card game similar to Magic: The Gathering . To get more cards, you buy 'expert packs' with your in-game winnings, or with real money. You get random cards, with four levels of rarity  — Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary. Advertisement The Wrong Numbers So what's the problem with everyone's numbers? Each expert pack gives you five cards, one of which is guaranteed to be Rare or better. Let's take my own post as an example: Common 142 71.0% Rare 49 24.5% Epic 8 4.0% Legendary 1 0.5% Advertisement So these numbers are accurate in that they reflect what percentage of each rarity we got in the 200 cards we drew, but they're useless if I was trying to guess what future packs might hold and decide if it's worth spending real money on expert packs. Every time you open a pack in Hearthstone , you're getting five cards, so you need to find the probability that any of those five will be what you're looking for, and account for the guaranteed rare card. Data Sources To find the data, I obviously couldn't buy 1,000 packs, even on Kotaku 's budget. But luckily, most people who plunk down $50 ( or more ) on cards also tend to post their results for people to watch. So I manually entered data from a variety of videos into a spreadsheet. There was speculation that Blizzard changed the card drop rates since the game officially launched in March, so I only used videos that were posted within the past two months (91% from the past month). Advertisement Results Okay, so now that we have more data, let's see what useful information we can get out of it. We're looking for something that can give us an idea of what will be in the next pack we open, and what that pack will be worth. So, from 1,000 packs:  Count Percent of Total Probability Per Pack Common 3565 71.30% 99.81% Rare 1155 23.10% 73.11% Epic 215 4.30% 19.73% Legendary 65 1.30% 6.33% Advertisement So every pack you open has a 99.81% chance of containing at least one common card. Now we're on the right track! If you go down from there, you'll see that the chances of getting at least one legendary card in a pack are actually considerably better than the .5% that we got from our 40 pack experiment . Now, while we did expand the sample size, we didn't observe all the possible combinations of cards. In 1,000 packs, we saw 16 of 55 possible combinations. The most common pack after a '4100' (4 common, 1 rare; 61% of packs) was a '3200' (3 common, 2 rare; 12.20%). Fun Facts The chances of getting a pack with any 5 legendary cards is one in a million The chances of getting a pack with any 5 golden legendary cards is 1 in 3.2 billion There's a 0.4% probability of getting 2 legendaries in a single pack The probability of getting a pack with only one common card is about ~0.80% There's a 16.26% probability of getting a pack with any golden card Only 2.19% of common cards were golden, while 7.69% of legendaries were The average $50 purchase of 40 packs will be worth about 3,600 Arcane Dust The best pack in our sample was 1 common, 2 rares, 1 epic, and 1 legendary UPDATE : Since Blizzard has released new DLC, we don't know if these numbers are still accurate. Thanks to everyone who sent in packs! Advertisement This is a pretty good sample size, but our data could be even more accurate with more information. So here are some ways to contribute: If you have 15 packs or more, put the data in a spreadsheet and send it to steve@kotaku.com, along with a video of opening the packs (for verification) and we'll update the data. Here's the spreadsheet layout: If you can't do that, post a screenshot of your best or worst pack in the comments! Advertisement Special thanks to @indiemaiden for crunching all the numbers, and Kotaku's Chris Person for the image. If you're interested in the videos where the data came from: 40 packs , 40 , 15 , 80 , 40 , 15 , 40 , 600 , 90 . To contact me, write to steve@kotaku.com or follow me on Twitter @Appleguysnake .

In 20 packs,  35.9% for exactly 0 legendary  37.7% for exactly 1 legendary  18.9% for exactly 2 legendary  7.5% for 3 or more legendary    In 40 packs,  0% for exactly 0 legendary (yay pity timer)  39.9% for exactly 1 legendary  27.8% for exactly 2 legendary  18.5% for exactly 3 legendary  13.8% for 4 or more legendary    In 52 packs,  25.9% for exactly 1 legendary  Etc      So while unlucky,  roughly 1 in 4 is hardly a statistical anomaly.

You can find an equal no. of ppl claiming otherwise, theres really no reason why blizzard would change the drop rate. They've already given us a free legendary this expansion  Increasing legendary drop rates so ppl buy less packs and those even buying decide to go f2p cuz blizzard just decides to give 4 legs in 15 packs? Doesn't seem like a good business strategy to me.

Even after opening 1000 packs there is a huge chance you won't open 50 legendaries(which how it is should be). Opening packs has huge variance, people please don't open threads like this every 5hours!

Only got 2 legendaries, no bullshit.  My friend pre-purchased the 50 packs and got 9 legendaries (one gold). He also had 5100 gold to buy 51 packs and got only 2 legendaries in those.  Blizzard rigged p2w packs?    Same thing if you think back to ungoro. I bought 45 packs with gold, received no legendary at all. Another friend who pre-purchased the packs got 2 golden legendaries and like 5 normal legendaries.

Note: Each Hearthstone pack will contain cards of 4 different rarities  RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack  EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs  LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs  In addition, please note that as players open more packs, the actual probabilities of getting cards of a higher quality increases.   Original Text   根据国家相关法规，《炉石传说》现将抽取卡牌的概率进行公布，具体如下：  备注：每包《炉石传说》卡牌包，均包含4张不同品质的卡牌。  稀有卡牌  每包炉石卡牌包至少可获得一张稀有 或更高 品质 的 卡牌。  史诗卡牌  平均5个炉石卡牌包，可获得一张史诗品质卡牌。  传说卡牌  平均20个炉石卡牌包，可获得一张传说品质卡牌。  此外，需要说明的是：随着卡牌包抽取数量的增多，玩家实际获得高品质卡牌的概率也将同步提高。   Source:  https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/69dexs/china_announces_hearthstone_card_pack_rarity_odds/    Personal Opinion:  Im pretty sad and upset about this, since it does not even provide some numbers. Its not totally clear and Golden Droprates arent mentioned either. I mean sure after 3 years of gathering data by the community itself, many things got figured out, but in all respect, this seems like they try to avoid as much information as possible and write it down in the most vague way possible.

The percentage here is you get an epic in 20% of the packs and that's the precise percentage you are asking for.  Sure the information they provided is vague and incomplete (there's no mention to golden probability and the pity timer is just named but not explained) but the little information in the post seems prety precise to me.

" In addition, please note that as players open more packs, the actual probabilities of getting cards of a higher quality increases."  As you can see, its actually not 1% for legendaries and its not 4% on epics since the chance of obtaining those increases, which means after my first pack i opened, the numbers change.The wording "Average" makes you believe that you simply can devide numbers and get an outcome just as you did. But if you take an "increasing chance" into consideration, "average", isnt what you think it is. Also, many believe that a pity timer means that if you didnt get a legendary on your 39th pack, you will get it at your 40th guaranteed. Well, kinda true, but how does this lead up to? It doesent mean that a number jumps from 0 to 100%. There are numbers and calculators before that. And this is what i wanted to know. The 1 out 20 legendary on average is an information that we already know since ages and if a state like china rules out a law that has the job to make loot boxes transperent, we dont need more vague responses, but precise responses.

But yeah, if we're going to force Blizzard into becoming more transparent, East Asia (where regulations on online entertainment is far stricter than NA) is the way to go. This isn't an amazing start, as Blizzard is clearly still playing word games here, but it's a start. China's a big market for Blizzard (maybe even bigger than NA), so hopefully pressure on their side will force Blizzard to open even more statistics up.

I mean, i understand that blizzard does not want to reveal those numbers, they want this as unclear as possible, but if a law rules out with the goal to make it transparent for users that gamble on loot boxes, one should not get away with this unclear information.    what it effectively means is that out of 100 cards (5 per pack, 20 packs) you end up with a 50% chance of getting a legendary.  So if I'm getting my math right, that would amount to a .5% chance of getting a legendary per card or a 2.5% per pack.    Note that this isn't REALLY the perfect number.  The issue is that it's NOT a set % per pack.  They have indirectly confirmed the Pity Timer and the timer gradually increases the chance of getting a particular rarity as you open more packs.  Thus if you JUST opened a legendary, your chance of the next pack getting a legendary is less than at the 20th pack.  So it's a sliding scale that we'd need one of the math pros to calculate.  Thus there is some merit to the way it's presented now.  If you get a set of 20 packs you have a coin flip that a pack will be in there.  If you get a set of 40 packs, you get a 100% chance of getting a legendary.  Similar story with 5 and 10 packs with epics.  For the record, if the % chance was locked it would make a 2% chance per card, and a 10% per pack).  As far as the 'information is just what we already know' well that's still useful since it's a confirmation.  Blizzard never HAS confirmed any of our numbers.  Also me and many others have been spouting the "Legendary is 1% per card" statement even though it makes no sense if the average is 20 packs.  As far as them not posting the per pack numbers I just wrote with the "the chance increases as you get packs" statement.. I guess China's law isn't as straitforward and strict as we thought :P.  Either that or China is going to raising a fuss at Blizzard soon.  (though I don't think hiding the gold card percentages is kosher.  I thin they are hoping China doesn't notice since THAT percentage is going to be VERY ugly)           Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack     One does not simply walk into Mordor,  unless they want to be the best they can be.               #15   May 5, 2017  (Un'Goro Launch)           Alexandru_91    Alexandru_91      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  Novice Engineer     1  7  29     Join Date: 5/4/2015   Posts: 45   BattleTag: DomnuLupu#2103   Member Details             I made some calculations and the results seem like this (for a legendary) :  1 pack..................20 packs............................40 packs  2.5%.....................50%....................................100%  With the rate increasing by 2.5% per pack to open a legendary (at least it follows the rule they have said)  Doable for epic drop rates as well , i suspect the pity timer is when you have 100% drop chance on the 40th pack because of the perpetual increase.

This doesn't explain anything. There's no telling if the chance grows in a linear or an exponential way.    Maybe it's just my lack of coffee, but while the rest of this post made sense... this part really didn't. So if we open more packs it scales? Or is this just acknowledging there is a pity timer?  Otherwise the rest seems okay I suppose; I spent a lot of years collecting baseball cards and physical card games, and it was common to see the average packs it would take to open something of X rarity or type. This is at least useful to confirm the Reddit math on it.

At least if I'm remembering what people have said about the pity timer right, you'd be guaranteed a Legendary in 40 packs of the same expansion but it wouldn't trigger if you bought 20 of one and 20 of another.

As far as we understand from gathered data is that it all comes and goes with the pity timer, which basically regulates everything. What this means i explain here a bit:  First of all, to answer your question, different sets have seperate counters, which means that if you opened lets say 39 classic packs without a legendary, you would under normal circumanstances get one at your 40 th pack, but only if thats a classic pack. It does not affect other sets, like Un Goro for instance.  Now to the pity timer:  Lets take the example of an average epic draw. Blizzard stated that you get 1 epic card out of 5 packs on average. Thats 1 card out of 25.  As we know your average legendary draw is 1 card out of 20 packs or in other words 1 out of 100.  So its easy to assume that your chance of getting a legendary is basically 1%, but thats not quite the reality, because blizzard just stated that your chances increase from pack to pack you didnt open one.  So far i understand average as the middle point and pity timer as the end point. Average is 20 packs for a legendary, and Pity timer is 40 packs for a legendary. Same should be true for epics. 1 out of 5 packs is the average, 10 packs should be the pity timer.  But its not clear from where the higher chances start. Do i have a higher chance for a legend after my first pack or is it the same until i hit the average number? Well, i hope you understand that by splitting your pack openings into multiple sets, you reduce your chance of finding something guaranteed. (Quality). In your example though you will open at least 1 epic card out of 10 packs (pity timer).

Between the two answers, I've gathered what I needed to know... and even something more ;)  About this:   So its easy to assume that your chance of getting a legendary is basically 1%, but thats not quite the reality, because blizzard just stated that your chances increase from pack to pack you didnt open one.

Unfortunately, my math is a bit rusty atm, so I'd like to think about it a little, before committing to say anything. No promises, but stay tuned!

I have the complete collection of non gold cards, which I have either packed or crafted by disenchanting duplicates. I have bought at least 500 packs overall and opened around 500+ from Arena rewards, all of the Tavern brawls plus free packs I have been given by Blizzard for Iphone/Preorder promotions.  I have never packed a Golden Legendary in 1000+ packs, my RNG with Epics and regular Legendarys seems ok and even above average at times but I even seem to get regular Legendarys twice as often as Golden Epics.  Is this normal? I often see the Golden Legendary text pop up when one of my friends get it. I even had a friend who got 3x Golden Legendarys in his first 50 packs of TGT.  I am not salty, I am fortunate enough to have a full collection but at this point is don't even bother looking at the Legendarys I pack because I know it will be a duplicate, I only get excited for Golden Cards and I find even Golden Commons rare to find.

Anyway, 1 in 13,7 legendarys you uncover is gonna be golden. So yeah, its rare.    It also says that a card has a 0.07% of being a golden legendary, or a 0.35% chance of finding one in a pack. In their data they had only 56 golden legendaries in 15,109 packs opened.  So yeah,  going you whole life without ever opening one is entirely possible.    That's rubbish. No way. I should have got 10 of them by now then. Instead of 0.

Regular legendary pity timer is about 1 in 40. Golden legendary is about 1 in 310. This 2 got their own separate pity timer  I had been keeping track since dec last year from my last (regular) legendary, than at pack 25 i gotten Golden Jaxx (i havent got 1 since i start playing since almost beta), 8 pack later which is 33 i gotten a tirion (this doesnt prove they got separate timer, however, what are the odds to pull 2 legendary in 8 pack, i am that unlucky type as well base on playing almost 2 year and only gotten 1 golden legendary recently.)

Blizzard      Hearthstone      Big, big news out of Hearthstone today, and I do not say that lightly. The game has been criticized for its increasingly high cost now that there are three expansions a year, combined with low legendary drop rates and decks that require the high-cost, extremely rare cards to function.  Blizzard’s solution? Drop a Diablo 3 Loot 2.0 generosity bomb on the whole situation.  Today, Hearthstone director Ben Brode announced a number of major changes when it comes to pack opening in Hearthstone, chief among them that players will no longer will receive duplicate Legendaries from packs, starting when the next expansion launches.  This has long been a requested fix from fans, especially in an era when new expansions can launch with 23 Legendaries (Un’goro), where you get one Legendary per 20 packs on average. Add in the chance to get many, many duplicates in that process and it’s a recipe for fan frustration.    In addition to this duplicate news, Brode also announced that all players would receive a Legendary within their first ten expansion packs. This will prevent players from testing the 40 pack  “mercy rule” when it comes to loading up an expansion for the first time and shelling out for dozens of packs. This has been another frequent buzz-killer the past few expansions.    Finally, packs will no longer contain more than two of the same common, epic or rare per pack, which is not really that common of an occurrence, but it can’t hurt.   The Legendary dupe issue is what’s the most significant, and it has to be the result of Blizzard taking a long, hard look at Hearthstone ’s problems. There’s a fine line between making sure your game is maximizing revenue but not turning off players because of its high cost. Lately, it’s felt like Hearthstone has become more expensive than ever, and Blizzard might be looking at some data showing players dropping out over time, feeling like they just can’t keep up.  Hearthstone will still cost a lot money, sure. Getting 20 Legendaries in a set will still take 400 packs on average, after all, but this change could have a lot of positive beneficial effects for the game. Players can now freely craft Legendaries without worrying they might get another copy. Players will have more dust to craft all the other cards they want when they’re getting more Legendaries in packs instead of having to spend 1600 dust on them. And with more Legendaries (and epics and rares) getting to more players, it might even help the overall health of the game, with players able to experiment more with new decks based on cards they might not have had otherwise (eh, who am I kidding? Everyone will still netdeck).  Blizzard must be really confident that this is the right move for Hearthstone going forward, because this isn’t the kind of thing you can announce and then take back later when you don’t like how much you’re giving away. But it’s hard to see any way this doesn’t help the health of the game overall, and I really applaud Blizzard for making this change. We will see how this ends up changing the course of Hearthstone in the coming months and years, and what problems may still remain going forward, even after this fix.  PS. What about goldens? Is a duplicate a duplicate if it's golden? Hmm.  Update : And I....totally missed the news that this same thing is happening to Overwatch loot boxes as well. Although there it's "fewer" duplicate Legendaries, not eliminating them completely.

Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet. Become a Redditor and subscribe to one of thousands of communities. × 1591 1592 1593 News China announces Hearthstone card pack rarity odds  ( self.hearthstone ) submitted 11 months ago  * by czhihong Blizzard China's (Chinese) link is here: http://hs.blizzard.cn/articles/20/9546  The link is dated 2 April , but it's not clear whether it was backdated or that they actually posted it then but everyone missed it.  UTC 0930 Edit : They've edited the statement regarding RARE cards, as bolded and in italics below.   Translation  In adherence to new laws, Hearthstone is hereby declaring the probabilities of getting specific card rarities from packs, with details as below.  Note: Each Hearthstone pack contains cards of 4 different rarities.   RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack  EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs  LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs   In addition, please note that as players open more packs, the actual probability of opening cards of a higher quality increases in tandem. [ my note: for those asking for clarification, this is very likely referring to the pity timer ]   Original Text   根据国家相关法规，《炉石传说》现将抽取卡牌的概率进行公布，具体如下：  备注：每包《炉石传说》卡牌包，均包含4张不同品质的卡牌。  稀有卡牌  每包炉石卡牌包至少可获得一张稀有 或更高 品质 的 卡牌。  史诗卡牌  平均5个炉石卡牌包，可获得一张史诗品质卡牌。  传说卡牌  平均20个炉石卡牌包，可获得一张传说品质卡牌。  此外，需要说明的是：随着卡牌包抽取数量的增多，玩家实际获得高品质卡牌的概率也将同步提高。     In my opinion, the last line is acknowledgement of the pity timer, but it's not 100% definitive. The literal meaning is closer to  " actual odds of getting better quality cards will increase in tandem as players open more packs ", but it's basically the same as what I wrote above.  The existence of a pity timer has been (essentially) acknowledged by the team.  The reason I think the link was either backdated or not released until now is that everyone just noticed it even though it's dated 2 April , and all comments are from today (starting from about an hour ago). It is also extremely unlikely that an article such as this one would be missed by everyone visiting the site since that date until now, considering it was just before Un'Goro's release. In any case, some of you seem to think it's a big deal but I don't think there's anything sinister or inappropriate about this particular backdating.  On a personal note, I'm not sure what everyone was expecting. They're not required to declare anything more than this I believe, and even if they did announce probabilities for golden cards, it would be the same as what we already know as well.   Edit : I've been touching up some of the translation, and may continue to do so.   807 comments share save hide report top 200 comments show 500 sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

The functionality of golden cards does not differ from their bland counterparts, their percentages do not need to be shared  Edit: Lots of debate about functionality in regards to worth/value. I agree that a golden card is certainly worth more, but it terms of functionality in game, there is no difference. Valid arguments can be made for either side of this debate around whether their probabilities should have been disclosed as well. My guess is that golden cards fall into some sort of 'loophole' in this law as they share the same name and rarity as their bland counterpart.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] DrQuint  276 points 277 points 278 points  11 months ago  (13 children) That doesn't really make sense. The law wasn't about tradable items, it was just about informing the player of the odds they were gambling with. And yes, the word "Gambling" is very intentional.  And unfortunately, I also do think this is enough. I would have liked to have the odds displayed in-game with every box, like what happens with mobile games, but hey, baby steps.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Michelanvalo  3 points 4 points 5 points  11 months ago  (9 children) Do mobile games in china show you the drop rates?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Scereye  70 points 71 points 72 points  11 months ago  (7 children) They have to. From now on.  I'm not sure if they have to have the Odds in the Game/App itself or if its enough to just put them on a homepage or something.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] gommerthus  8 points 9 points 10 points  11 months ago  (2 children) Indeed.  Just remember that while they must disclose odds, this does not mean that there are workaround already in place, especially on gacha games.  For example a weapon(or collectible character) may be designated as a legendary - thereby the odds of obtaining that character are defined and revealed as per China's rules.  BUT that does not mean that the stat roll on that character or weapon is where you want it to be, especially in RPG games where stat growth is key.  For example let's say you score Sylvanas and her best stat is 5/5.  But you opened the loot box and obtained her at only 3/4.  This situation falls within China's rules.  But you will end up opening more boxes in an effort to score the stats that you actually wanted.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (2 replies) load more comments (4 replies) load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (3 replies) [–] drwsgreatest  30 points 31 points 32 points  11 months ago  (2 children) I would think that the fact that golden cards have a higher dust value would be enough reason to have to list their drop rates separately, since the excess dust is something of value that you are still gambling on whether or not you get it.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] yoshi_mon  4 points 5 points 6 points  11 months ago  (1 child) I'm pretty surprised that Blizzard thinks that not including that information would be acceptable.  Hearthstone is just a small indy game of course but I'm sure most of the Chinese know that the dust mechanic is pretty integral to the way it works.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Timepants02  9 points 10 points 11 points  11 months ago  (0 children) I don't think any of us are experts on Chinese law, and I'm guessing that a company with yearly revenue in the multi-billion dollar range like Netease has a fleet of corporate lawyers who are.  So I'm gonna take their word over Reddit's that this is in compliance with the law until the Chinese government says otherwise.  Sucks, but that's business. Its in Blizz and Netease's best interest to be as vague as possible about the drop rates while still complying, so that's what they're going to do.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Kljunas1  32 points 33 points 34 points  11 months ago  (0 children) But they do differ pretty significantly in that they give more dust.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Aalnius  2 points 3 points 4 points  11 months ago  (0 children) meh tbh they will likely have to disclose it if the law is enforced strictly, laws like this are meant to try to curb gambling a little by giving people more information if a person will gamble for it then it needs its rates shown so they can make the best decision possible.  There will be people who will gamble excessively to get golden cards.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] zer1223  2 points 3 points 4 points  11 months ago  (0 children)  The functionality of golden cards does not differ from their bland counterparts   Do they have to reveal skin dropreates or don't they? Its not about functionality.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (3 replies) [–] thejusner  2 points 3 points 4 points  11 months ago  (22 children) Is there any consistency to golden cards in packs?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Dragonheart91  14 points 15 points 16 points  11 months ago  (20 children) Yes, guaranteed golden legendary after I believe 400 packs. It's hard to get enough data to confirm that though. Golden epic and golden rare have pity timers too although I don't remember them.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] thejusner  1 point 2 points 3 points  11 months ago  (2 children) Had no idea, I figured golden cards were purely just random.

Your chances of opening a legendary in 20 packs is still only 64.2%. Sounds correct to me.  Considering that the pack opening data collected by third parties shows a legendary opened in 5% of packs (i.e. 1/20), my guess is the published odds include the pity timer.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] anrwlias  221 points 222 points 223 points  11 months ago  (27 children) People simply don't have an intuitive sense of how probabilities work.

If you open a legendary, then open a few more packs, you'll be much less than 1/20 on those packs, but as you continue opening more packs, the chances increase far above 1/20, eventually to 1/1. They average out to 1/20 but that isn't representative of your odds on a smaller sample size, so Blizz is still kinda gaming the system by adjusting the frequency of cards over more pack openings. Them saying 1/20, while not disingenuous, doesn't really represent the reality, which is that you can only get that 1/20 by buying lots of packs.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (2 replies) load more comments (26 replies) [–] Joe_Baker_bakealot  2 points 3 points 4 points  11 months ago  (0 children) Humans are garbage at guessing probabilities. I read once on this Reddit that you're supposed to get an epic every five packs and the average dust value of a value is around 100 dust. I couldn't believe it.

It's just hard to believe.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (20 replies) [–] Hutzlipuz  27 points 28 points 29 points  11 months ago  (6 children) But then the statement "actual odds of getting better quality cards will increase in tandem as players open more packs"  would be wrong. It sounds like the base likelihood was 1 in 20 and it was further increased by the pitty timer.  Also "opening more packs" sounds like a very skewed representation of the pity timer. 
In any way I feel their answer is more than half-assed and arguably even factually wrong.

Average simply means the overall chances of opening a legendary in any given pack, which seems to be 1 in 20 including the pity timer from the data people have gathered. It doesn't refer to the exact odds of getting a legendary in the first pack after you got the last one, which would be the base chance.  The wording on the pity timer part is really disappointing, though.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (2 replies) [–] vhdblood  5 points 6 points 7 points  11 months ago  (9 children) I seriously doubt that, as then these stats would mean nothing if you open only a few packs, and therefore would be dishonest. I think it much more likely that the pity timer applies and increases those odds each time, until you get to 1 legendary every pack when you open the 40th pack if you have not gotten one on the previous 39 packs.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  20 points 21 points 22 points  11 months ago  (8 children) We can strongly suspect that the pity timer is factored in because our data indicated a legendary every 20 packs and we were just collecting info on pack openings in general.   permalink embed save parent load more comments (8 replies) [–] brianbezn  17 points 18 points 19 points  11 months ago  (51 children) That is kind of misleading, cause then 1 in 20 is not the odds people get when purchasing lower amounts of packs.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (51 replies) load more comments (27 replies) [–] Sunwoken  4 points 5 points 6 points  11 months ago  (2 children) Pity timers barely affect the average, they just catch the outliers.

In Dota2, a lot of their RNG abilities are pseudo-random :   Slardar's Bash of the Deep has a 25% chance to stun the target. On the first attack, however, it only has an ~8.5% probability to bash. Each subsequent attack without a bash increases the probability by ~8.5%. So on the second attack, the chance is ~17%, on the third it is ~25.5%, etc. After a bash occurs, the probability resets to ~8.5% for the next attack. These probabilities average out so that, over a moderate period of time, Bash of the Deep procs nearly 25% of the time.   I think that stuff is very cool; keep games from being turned because someone got extraordinarily lucky or unlucky.  Blizz might do something similar with their drop rates, such that the chance is 5% but the odds of getting legs twice in a row are very low, while the odds of getting one over time eventually increase to 100%.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (3 replies) [–] bdzz  55 points 56 points 57 points  11 months ago *  (4 children) Basically confirmed by the pack openings data @ https://pitytracker.com   http://imgur.com/D4BScrt  1% on legendaries (from 100 cards so on average every 20th pack contains a legendary)  4% on epics (from 100 cards so on average every 5th pack contains an epic)   permalink embed save give gold [–] LightChaos  6 points 7 points 8 points  11 months ago  (1 child) Pitytracker also keeps track of the fact that simply by opening packs of a certain type and not opening a legendary or epic, even when you haven't hit the pity timer yet, increases the chances of opening those rarities; this is actually confirmed by this statement:   actual odds of getting better quality cards will increase in tandem as players open more packs    permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (2 replies) [–] CruelMetatron  65 points 66 points 67 points  11 months ago  (15 children) I thought a epic/legendary can replace a rare (?), so it's not at least one rare per pack.   permalink embed save give gold [–] czhihong [ S ]  64 points 65 points 66 points  11 months ago  (6 children) They've actually edited the article to add " or better " after rare.

If china is to recognize the gamble as a gamble there is no place for the veil around the algorithm.  People can do funny business with the algorithm all the time. For example "This slot machine has average 60% winrate" is a true statement even if it is rigged so only the employees can win. This is why those people get arrested all the time.

Because studies have been made on hundreds of thousands of packs, so the statistics of the packs have been pretty well known for years : see this . That's basically every info you would need as a player as they describe what you should be expecting from your packs in the long run.  I understand that some people out of curiosity want to know the exact algorithm, but again this would bring nothing new as this does not change the observed statistics. Sure the statement is "vague" and does not mention golden cards, but there is no reason to get upset as we already know those numbers.

I wish they'd word this better (or maybe as a non-native speaker, it's less clear). Does this mean that as you open more packs and don't receive that kind of card (epic, legendary, golden whatever) that the odds increase until you open said rarity?  I can only assume that's what it means because then that implies that if you open more packs, you'll increasingly get a better rarity of cards with no end.

So it's not a countdown till your next legendary, but your RNG get's better with each pack. I can't see there needing to be much more code behind it than that.  What more were we expecting?

I think it is sickening how games like FIFA which  are clearly marketed at a younger generation get away with getting all those kids to gamble away their money without any form of neutral party control. people complain that these card odds are already figured out a long time ago and therefore this deceleration is useless. I don't know exactly how strict it is in China, but this should also mean that now that they released the odds they aren't allowed to chance them without notice. in theory Blizzard could release a new set of packs in NA and EU and just change the odds so you are extremely unlikely to pull Legendaries even after 100s of packs and most players would probably not realize until it is too late. sure, Blizzard would probably not do something like this, but why even leave that as a possiblity when you can also regulate it and keep everyone in the clear?   permalink embed save give gold [–] OriginalName123123  1 point 2 points 3 points  11 months ago  (1 child) 1) That's actually very little info.  2) We already knew this so whatever :/   permalink embed save give gold [–] anrwlias  2 points 3 points 4 points  11 months ago  (0 children) 1) It was precisely the info that was required.  2) It was pointing out, for days, that this wasn't going to reveal any new information.

I'm pretty sure opening 100 packs doesn't guarantee a player 5 legendaries. Do they need to open 1000 packs to get 50 legendaries? More?  Also the pity timer is definitely factored in here. There's no way 1 in 20 is the number without the pity timer. But of course, they couldn't even be bothered to say that.  Change percentages into words in a lame attempt to confuse people.

The Google translation of the Chinese original , as always, is rough, but it works out like this: Every Hearthstone pack will contain at least one card of "rare" quality of better; "epic" cards will appear at an average of one every five packs; and "legendary" cards will turn up at a rate of one every 20 packs.  The rates are pretty close to what players have already established independently: This thread from December 2016, for instance, references previous research determining that legendaries drop at a rate of one per 18-20 packs. What's interesting is the very last line, which Redditor Czhihong translated to, "actual odds of getting better quality cards will increase in tandem as players open more packs." That would seemingly confirm the existence of the so-called "pity timer," which basically increases the odds of scoring a legendary the longer you go without one. The existence of the pity timer isn't a secret by any stretch, but it's still nice to have it and the drop rates, officially confirmed—even if, as with Overwatch, we can't be absolutely certain that the same rates apply outside of China. Now if someone could only do something about pulling the Paladin Quest twice in a row.
