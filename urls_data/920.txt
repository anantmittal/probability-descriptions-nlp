Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Maddie Meyer/Getty Images      The 2018 NFL Playoffs continue on Sunday with the New England Patriots hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game. This has all the potential in the world to be a great battle, pitting a dynasty against an upstart team. The offensive powerhouse Patriots are led by a future Hall of Famer under center and have been the league's most successful organization for the better part of two decades, while the Jaguars unexpected success is a product of a world-class defense and running game.  It’s New England’s seventh consecutive foray into the AFC Championship—and no one is surprised the team is back this year—while Jacksonville is competing in its third conference title game in franchise history and the first since 1999. Not many expected the Jags to make it anywhere close to as far as they have this year, as their preseason expectations for total wins was set at 6.5 and their odds to make the postseason were longer than 3-to-1.  The Jags have been a great story, but oddsmakers aren’t giving them much of a chance to continue it in Super Bowl LII. They opened as an eight-point underdog after shocking the Pittsburgh Steelers, 45-42, last week and haven’t strayed from that number thanks to major public support for the Pats. New England is tough to bet against, especially after a thorough beating like the 35-14 one it put on the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round.    Will the Pats continue steamrolling their way to a third Super Bowl appearance in four years, or will a feisty Jaguars team that has toppled a number of elite foes in 2017 finally stop them? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has been analyzing this matchup all week long and has a lean on the game that you won’t want to miss.

Jacksonville Jaguars    One of the biggest stories leading up to this game is an injury to New England quarterback Tom Brady. The 40-year-old reportedly jammed his throwing hand during practice on Wednesday according to Karen Guregian :   Tom Brady jammed his throwing hand at practice after accidentally being run into, according to a source. X-rays showed no structural damage.  — Karen Guregian (@kguregian) January 17, 2018   [Update: Brady is active and will start in the 2018 AFC Championship Game]  Brady has never missed a single start during his 15 postseason trips and it’s near impossible that this will keep him from playing against the Jags. The future Hall of Famer spent time with the organization’s medical staff instead of meeting with reporters earlier in the week, but this doesn’t seem to be anyway concerning for the club. Ian Rapoport found two sources close to the situation that claimed Brady would be good to go on Sunday:   #Patriots QB Tom Brady’s right hand “should be OK,” per someone close to him. Another source said simply, “He will play” after his hand was on the injury report.  — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 18, 2018         Page 1 / 4  Continue           Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                       Home English Menu Sports Odds Picks Betting Language English Español Português NFL Odds Futures Picks Consensus Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Team Reports Database Super Bowl NCAAF Odds Futures Picks Consensus Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Team Reports Database NCAA Football Bowl Central NBA Odds Futures Picks Consensus Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Referee Stats Team Reports Database NBA Finals NCAAB Odds Futures Picks Consensus Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Team Reports Database March Madness MLB Odds Futures Picks Consensus Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Pitcher Logs Probable Pitchers Pitcher Run Support Pitcher Money Won/Lost Team Reports Database Umpire Stats World Series NHL Odds Futures Picks Consensus Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Team Reports Database Stanley Cup Final UFC Odds Pound For Pound Consensus Events Fighters Rankings Stats Golf Odds Boxing Odds Soccer English Premier League World Cup News CFL Odds Futures Picks Scores Standings Stats Game Logs Betting Trends Power Rankings Database Team Reports NASCAR Drivers Standings Schedule Tracks WNBA Odds Scores Standings Stats Database Team Reports ATP Tennis Odds Schedule Players World Rankings WTA Tennis Odds Schedule Players World Rankings Horse Racing Kentucky Derby Preakness Stakes Belmont Stakes Entertainment Other eSports Vegas Formula 1 Olympics NFL Headlines Will Johnny Manziel be signed by an NFL team before or during the NFL season?

The Patriots are 7.5-point favorites in the NFL playoffs , down one from the opener. The line had moved as high as 9.5 before concerns over QB Tom Brady's hand send it diving. Brady returned to practice Friday, but may wear a glove on his throwing hand against the Jaguars. The Over-Under, or total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 46, down from an open of 47. Before you lock in any picks for Jaguars-Patriots, you need to see what Galin Dragiev has to say. Last week, Dragiev told SportsLine readers to back New England -13.5 over Tennessee, saying that the game would "get ugly quickly." Sure enough, the Patriots built a 21-7 halftime lead en route to a 21-point demolition. Strikingly, that improved Dragiev to 16-4 in his past 20 NFL picks , a stunning 80 percent cash rate. Anyone who has followed his advice is up big.    Part of his success: Dragiev, a daily fantasy sports specialist, learned early on to predict the outcome of the game before determining how success trickles down to individual players, so he spent more time studying team outcomes than projecting individual players. When it comes to predictions, he trusts numbers above all else. Now, he has examined every angle, every matchup and every trend in Jaguars vs. Patriots and locked in his pick. You can only see it over at SportsLine. Dragiev knows Brady's injured hand has thrown a wrinkle into the Patriots-Jaguars betting line. It required multiple stitches and the 13-time Pro Bowler missed practiced on Thursday before returning on Friday. He's officially listed as questionable and could wear a glove on his throwing hand to protect the stitches, which he's not used to doing. On Saturday, Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald Tweeted that Brady's outlook was trending up: "After thorough treatment for a few days, Tom Brady's hand is expected to be just fine tomorrow against the Jaguars, according to those around him."    And CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora added, "Tom Brady is still Tom Brady. Believe that. He's good to go. We'll all see as much tomorrow." Dragiev also knows the Jaguars rely on defense and running the ball, both of which could help them stay within the spread. The Jags were tops in the league in rushing yards at 141.4 per game, seven more than the closest team. In the postseason, their 159.5 rushing average is over 25 more than anyone else. Jaguars RB Leonard Fournette , despite missing a portion of last week's game with an ankle injury, piled up 109 yards rushing and three touchdowns against the Steelers . He's topped 100 yards from scrimmage three of the last five weeks and scored five times during that span.    SportsLine's advanced projection model says that Fournette will once again top 100 yards rushing on Sunday against New England and find the end zone. Defensively, the Jaguars were second in scoring defense (16.8 points per game) and No. 1 against the pass (169.9 yards per game). But just because the Jaguars can run the ball and play tough defense doesn't mean they'll keep it close against Brady's Pats in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Even if the Patriots are stymied through the air due to Jacksonville's defense or Brady's ailment, they've been able to run effectively. Dion Lewis had 141 yards from scrimmage against the Titans , 133 against the Jets in Week 17, and 153 against the Bills in Week 16. He had 20 catches over that span.    The Patriots will also get running back Rex Burkhead (knee) back from injury. Burkhead has six touchdowns in his past four games and gives New England another versatile player out of the backfield in the AFC title game. He has been sidelined since Dec. 17 and practiced on a limited basis all week. It's no surprise that Dragiev is leaning Under, but he knows there's a critical x-factor that determines which side of Jaguars-Patriots you need to be all over. He's only sharing his strong pick over at SportsLine. So what side of Jaguars vs. Patriots do you need to jump on in the AFC Championship Game? Visit SportsLine now to see what critical x-factor determines which side of the Jaguars-Patriots spread prevails, all from an expert on a 16-4 run in NFL picks , and find out.

This game has the potential to be a truly epic one, pitting a battle-tested, veteran-laden New England squad against an upstart Jacksonville club that hadn’t made the postseason in a decade but is coming off back-to-back wins in the 2018 NFL Playoffs.  Oddsmakers are expecting the Patriots—competing in their record seventh-straight AFC Championship Game—to advance to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, opening betting with them as an 8.5-point favorite (update: the line is now NE -9). It’s not a surprise considering New England’s mastery over this opponent throughout history and its convincing victory over the Tennessee Titans on Saturday. Here’s a closer look at the upcoming contest, including the schedule, start time, opening odds, TV info and more:  2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide    Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  Jacksonville has overcome longer odds this season and had no problem taking care of business on Sunday when it upset the Pittsburgh Steelers as a seven-point underdog. The Jags had a unique advantage going into that matchup, having already beaten the Steelers at Heinz Field back in October. ESPN Stats & Info noted that Jacksonville is now 5-1 in Pittsburgh since 2004 :    The Jaguars are now 5-1 at Heinz Field since the Steelers drafted Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, including the postseason. pic.twitter.com/ify48t8aJx  — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 14, 2018   The Jaguars have not had nearly as much success against the Patriots, winning just one of 11 total games against them since coming into the league as an expansion franchise in 1995. Jacksonville’s only win against New England came all the way back in a 1999 AFC Wild Card, which was prior to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady’s arrival. Since those two began a dynasty in 2001, the Jags have lost all seven games against this opponent, a stretch that includes two postseason showdowns and an embarrassing 51-17 blowout in their last outing in 2015.    The Jaguars will again find it tough to eliminate a determined, well-coached New England team that features 41 players that participated in a combined 317 playoff games prior to this postseason, which is 30 more players and 275 more games than Jacksonville’s roster could claim. The Jaguars haven’t let that lack of playoff experience slow them down yet, however, and are now amongst the final four organizations left competing for a Super Bowl LII title.  Will the Patriots live up to expectation as chalk in the AFC Championship, or will the Jags pull off another upset on the way to an improbable Super Bowl appearance? Betting expert Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has an early take on the matter, but first check out some of the early Twitter reactions to this improbable matchup:        Page 1 / 3  Continue           Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                    NBA NFL World Football CBB NHL MLB CFB MMA WWE NASCAR Golf Tennis Boxing More Trending Mag Tickets Get The App WWE Sign Up Login NFL Playoffs Jacksonville Jaguars vs. New England Patriots: Odds, Analysis, NFL Betting Pick OddsShark.com @ @OddsShark Featured Columnist January 16, 2018  Comments Brett Carlsen/Getty Images The Jacksonville Jaguars hope to pull off a second straight road upset this postseason and get to their first-ever Super Bowl when they visit the New England Patriots in Sunday's AFC Championship Game  as big road underdogs at online betting sites . The Super Bowl champion Patriots are playing in their seventh consecutive conference title game and hosting their third in four years, going 3-3 in their previous six appearances dating back to the 2011 season.  NFL point spread: The Patriots opened as 9.5-point favorites; the total was 46 early in the week, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark. ( Line updates and matchup report ) NFL betting pick, via OddsShark computer: 29.9-16.2 Patriots ( NFL picks on every game ) Check out the OddsShark podcast on iTunes or at OddsShark.libsyn.com for more odds info, picks and a breakdown of this week's top sports betting news.  Why the Jaguars can cover the spread Jacksonville may not have the postseason experience or quarterback play of New England, but this team has just about everything else needed to get to the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have arguably more defensive talent than any of the four teams left in the playoff field, including the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC. They also have a strong running back in rookie Leonard Fournette, who rolled over the Pittsburgh Steelers with 290 rushing yards on 53 carries and five touchdowns in two wins this season, including last week's 45-42 victory in the divisional round.  Why the Patriots can cover the spread The Patriots have won each of the past seven meetings with Jacksonville straight up, going 5-2 against the spread in those games. They are also a remarkable 10-1 ATS on the NFL point spreads in their last 11 games overall and riding a seven-game home winning streak in the postseason. If those betting trends were not enough, they will have future Hall of Famer Tom Brady under center in one of the biggest positional mismatches in conference championship game history opposite Blake Bortles of the Jaguars. It is almost unthinkable to imagine Bortles possibly getting the best of Brady at Gillette Stadium with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.  Smart pick Jacksonville matched up extremely well with Pittsburgh, which is why the team won both meetings fairly easily. That will not be the case with a New England squad led by two of the all-time greats in Brady and head coach Bill Belichick . The Patriots are easily the best team remaining of the four playing for two spots in the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have been a fun story, but they will be overmatched in this spot, so look for Brady and the Patriots to flex their muscles en route to another double-digit playoff win.  NFL betting trends The Jaguars are 0-7 SU and 2-5 ATS in their last seven games against the Patriots. The total has gone under in three of the Jaguars' last four games against the Patriots. The Patriots are 10-1 ATS in their last 11 games.  All NFL odds and betting trends courtesy of Bleacher Report's official odds partner, OddsShark.

Elise Amendola/Associated Press The New England Patriots are expected to make a run at the Super Bowl nearly every year, but the Jacksonville Jaguars are virtual strangers to the AFC title game. The Jaguars have had the opportunity to play for the conference championship twice, in 1996 and 1999. They failed on both of those occasions, and they have made the playoffs just three times since, including this season. The Patriots have won two of the past three Super Bowls and are attempting to win their second title in a row and third in four years. Head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady are going for their sixth Super Bowl titles with the franchise. If that is going to happen, they are going to have to hold off the upstart Jaguars in Sunday's title game. Jacksonville won the AFC South this year, and the Jaguars edged the Buffalo Bills 10-3 in the Wild Card Game. They were expected to go down rather easily in the divisional round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Jags jumped out to a 28-7 lead and did enough in the latter portions of the game to hang on for a 45-42 victory at Heinz Field. Despite the score of that game, Jacksonville is largely dependent on its defense, a unit that ranked second in yards allowed this season. The Jaguars have an explosive pass rush, led by defensive ends Calais Campbell and Yannick Ngakoue. Those two combined for 26.5 sacks during the regular season, and if Jacksonville is going to find a way to beat the Patriots on the road, it is going to have to put significant pressure on Brady. The condition of Brady's hand could be an issue against Jacksonville. Bill Sikes/Associated Press Brady may not be 100 percent, as he suffered a bruise to his right hand in practice Wednesday and did not participate in Thursday's session. He wore a glove on his passing hand during Friday's media session, and New England listed him as questionable. The full extent of the injury is unclear, but oddsmakers have apparently been paying attention to it. The Patriots were nine-point favorites to start the gameweek, but the spread was down to 7.5 points around 48 hours before the game, according to OddsShark . The total for the game is listed at 45 points. In addition to making a wager on the game's outcome or the total, bettors can also make prop bets on the AFC Championship Game. Among the prop bets are markets on the first-half margin and the margin of victory. Bettors are offered odds if they can successfully wager on the point differential after 30 minutes. For example, a bettor who believes the Patriots will win the game by 14 points could risk $100 to bet the final margin will end up between 13 and 18 points. If that bettor is correct, they would receive a plus-400 payoff. That translates to $500, meaning the bettor gets their $100 stake back in addition to a $400 profit. A bettor who believes the Jaguars will win by 10 points can risk $100 for a plus-1200 payoff. Bettors can also wager on whether there will be a defensive or special teams touchdown. Those who bet that either one of those options take place would receive a plus-200 payoff if they are correct. Betting against either one of those happening would require a bettor to risk $260 to win $100. Bettors who believe that points will go on the board quickly could wager $100 that there will be a score in the first 5:30 of the game for a $145 payoff. Bettors would have to risk $175 to win $100 if they believe there will be no scoring in the first 5:30.

An eighth straight win over the Jaguars this Sunday would send the Patriots to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years and the eighth time in the last 17 years.  New England is a 9.5-point home favorite in Foxborough at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com. The Patriots have won by at least 11 points in each of their last five home games against the Jaguars.   Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots  When: Sunday, Jan . 21, 3:05 p.m. ET  Where: Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass .  Betting Line / Total: New England -9.5 / 46.5 Points  Jaguars at Patriots OddsShark Matchup Report   New England Patriots  Regardless of what the spread gets set at, the Patriots and their backers don’t seem to mind. New England’s 35-14 win over the Tennessee Titans last Saturday as 13.5-point favorites was the team’s third straight win and cover as a double-digit favorite and brought the Patriots’ record over their last 11 games to 10-1 SU and ATS. The Patriots have won the 10 games over that stretch by an average margin of 15.7 points per game.  The Patriots haven’t lost a playoff game at home since 2013. New England is 7-0 SU and 6-1 ATS over its last seven postseason games, per the OddsShark NFL Database .   Jacksonville Jaguars  One week after mustering up a measly 10 points at home against the Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville went into Pittsburgh on Sunday and scored 45 points en route to a stunning 45-42 win.  Leonard Fournette led the way for the Jaguars on offense with 109 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. While the offensive outburst was a nice surprise, allowing 469 passing yards and five passing touchdowns on defense doesn’t bode well ahead of a matchup against Tom Brady. Jacksonville is 2-5 SU and ATS in its last seven playoff road games.  Sunday’s total is set at 46.5 points at online sports betting sites. The UNDER is 6-1 in New England’s last seven AFC Championship game appearances.  On paper, this looks like a compelling matchup between the AFC’s best defensive team in the Jaguars and the conference’s best offensive team in the Patriots. But given New England’s history and reputation both in the postseason and against Jacksonville in recent years, it is hard to shake the feeling that the Patriots will be on their way to the big game again.

By  Louis Bien @louisbien    Jan 15, 2018,  6:51am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  The Jaguars beat the Steelers for the same reason they can beat the Patriots: They’re pissed      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports     The Jacksonville Jaguars are going to the AFC Championship to play the New England Patriots . Even after a season in which the Jags played objectively excellent football — a 10-6 record, plus-149 point differential, the eighth-best team by DVOA — that still feels weird to say.  The Jaguars have been a punchline for so long — still are a punchline , in fact — that it’s easy to assume this will all go wrong. There’s evidence that it should. NFL teams only move out of their stations with great effort. We tend to see the same teams in the playoffs every year . And especially when a good team has a mediocre quarterback, we assume that team is doomed. Hence, the Steelers were 7-point favorites.  The Jaguars beat them in a thriller Sunday. They won deservingly, in all the ways that make them a big problem for the Patriots next week. They were fast, tough, and opportunistic, embodying all of the potential that young teams have over veteran ones.  They looked Super Bowl capable, basically. Which is a long way from saying that’s where they’re going, and I say that because the Patriots have been another deviation better than everyone in the postseason this century. They should be comfortable favorites in Foxborough next week.  But the Jaguars showed Sunday why the AFC Championship should be fascinating at the very least.  The Jaguars defense has dominated the team’s story all season. For good reason — it was second in the NFL in yards allowed, points allowed, and sacks, and first in passing yards allowed. The Jags scored eight defensive touchdowns (including one against the Steelers), which is three more than any other team in the league . They have Jalen Ramsey, and Jalen Ramsey is fun and salty as hell .  Yet if the Jaguars had lost Sunday, it would have been, mostly, the defense’s fault. Not that there’s much you can do when Ben Roethlisberger is throwing passes like this ...           ... and this ...           ... on fourth downs. But, ostensibly, that should have been a disaster for a run-first Jacksonville offense poorly designed for a shootout.  Yet the Jaguars offense LIT IT UP against a good defense — ninth by DVOA. The total yardage wasn’t a lot — 378 yards to the Steelers’ 545 — but they committed zero turnovers for a second straight game and went 8 for 14 converting third downs. The Jags ran 61 plays, and only one went for a loss: Blake Bortles took a knee at the end of the first half for minus-1 yard.  Bortles himself was excellent. I know 14 of 26 doesn’t look like much, but he did it at 8.23 yards per attempt. Six of those passes were first-down throws on third down, and he picked up another with his legs. It wasn’t a mind-blowing performance, but if you had seen Bortles’ Tebow-ian game against the Bills you would have been shocked.    SB Nation’s home for all things Jacksonville Jaguars          Read more at Big Cat Country    The Steelers threw everything at the Jaguars that they can reasonably expect to see against the Patriots. Roethlisberger had 469 yards and five touchdown passes. Le’Veon Bell had 155 total yards (67 rushing and 88 receiving) and two touchdowns. Antonio Brown did damage deep — seven catches for 132 yards and two touchdowns — while tight end Vance McDonald torched the Jaguars underneath — 10 catches for 112 yards.  The Steelers — one of the best, most-balanced teams in the NFL — played near-impeccable offensive football, and lost.  And while we’re making the academic argument that the Jaguars can make the Super Bowl, it’s worth pointing out that this was the second time the Steelers lost a thriller in the last few weeks, the last being the so-called “Game Of The Year” on Dec. 17 when they fell to the Pats because of the fickle nature of the catch rule . By transitive property, the Jaguars can absolutely hang with the Patriots, and even beat them, despite what Las Vegas will have to say about it.   Full disclosure: I want the Jaguars to make it to the Super Bowl very badly. They are rough-cut and energetic. The defense plays with an abandon that actually makes it fun to watch.  They are havoc wreakers and shit talkers that dragged a relatively pedestrian, but periodically explosive offense to the playoffs, along with an equally rough-cut and energetic fan base that would be perfectly out of its element in Minnesota in February.  The Jaguars probably won’t beat the Patriots. I wouldn’t take that bet, and anyone of sound mind wouldn’t take that bet unless they literally knew nothing about NFL football beyond the last few weeks. And even then — the Patriots just tore apart a Titans team that was essentially the Jaguars lite. The Jaguars will be playing on the road against a team that has game planned for this specific moment better than any team in history.  That said, I’m not sure that these Jaguars know the odds. They do know when the other side is talking trash, though. They made that clear after their win against the Steelers .    This team is GASSED. UP. And there’s someone Malik Jackson would like to see...... #Jaguars  pic.twitter.com/BOVjUeoSDt — Alyssa Lang (@AlyssaLang) January 14, 2018     That’s defensive tackle Malik Jackson referring to Steelers safety Mike Mitchell , who guaranteed a victory this week. He wasn’t the only Steelers player to say something he probably now regrets before the game. So did the Titans’ Jurrell Casey , who coincidentally is also now back at home.  The Patriots would do well to keep quiet this week, and knowing Bill Belichick they will. The Pats may be the best-ever team at side-stepping off-field distractions, too, as evidenced by the fact that after an ESPN story about New England’s internal tensions the team — *gasp* — played one of its best games of the season.  The Jaguars, meanwhile, are ... umm ...    "We goin' to the Super Bowl. AND we gon' win that b---h" -- Jalen Ramsey to the crowd of Jaguars fans at EverBank Field pic.twitter.com/fE2jSx3Pj1 — Sports Illustrated (@SInow) January 15, 2018     Yes, you’d have to be pretty ignorant of NFL history to think the Patriots aren’t headed to their eighth Super Bowl this century. That’s beside the point.  What matters is that these Jaguars don’t know any better, and, in fact, are going to find some reason — any reason — to enter this game just as pissed off as ever before. They beat the Steelers because they are full of cuss. If they beat the Patriots, that’s exactly how they’ll do it, too.

Jacksonville Jaguars AFC Championship Game Picks  Jan 20, 2018, 08:00am              Alex Kay     Contributor                  Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin              Maddie Meyer/Getty Images      The 2018 NFL Playoffs continue on Sunday with the New England Patriots hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game. This has all the potential in the world to be a great battle, pitting a dynasty against an upstart team. The offensive powerhouse Patriots are led by a future Hall of Famer under center and have been the league's most successful organization for the better part of two decades, while the Jaguars unexpected success is a product of a world-class defense and running game.  It’s New England’s seventh consecutive foray into the AFC Championship—and no one is surprised the team is back this year—while Jacksonville is competing in its third conference title game in franchise history and the first since 1999. Not many expected the Jags to make it anywhere close to as far as they have this year, as their preseason expectations for total wins was set at 6.5 and their odds to make the postseason were longer than 3-to-1.  The Jags have been a great story, but oddsmakers aren’t giving them much of a chance to continue it in Super Bowl LII. They opened as an eight-point underdog after shocking the Pittsburgh Steelers, 45-42, last week and haven’t strayed from that number thanks to major public support for the Pats. New England is tough to bet against, especially after a thorough beating like the 35-14 one it put on the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round.    Will the Pats continue steamrolling their way to a third Super Bowl appearance in four years, or will a feisty Jaguars team that has toppled a number of elite foes in 2017 finally stop them? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has been analyzing this matchup all week long and has a lean on the game that you won’t want to miss.

Jacksonville Jaguars    One of the biggest stories leading up to this game is an injury to New England quarterback Tom Brady. The 40-year-old reportedly jammed his throwing hand during practice on Wednesday according to Karen Guregian :   Tom Brady jammed his throwing hand at practice after accidentally being run into, according to a source. X-rays showed no structural damage.  — Karen Guregian (@kguregian) January 17, 2018   [Update: Brady is active and will start in the 2018 AFC Championship Game]  Brady has never missed a single start during his 15 postseason trips and it’s near impossible that this will keep him from playing against the Jags. The future Hall of Famer spent time with the organization’s medical staff instead of meeting with reporters earlier in the week, but this doesn’t seem to be anyway concerning for the club. Ian Rapoport found two sources close to the situation that claimed Brady would be good to go on Sunday:   #Patriots QB Tom Brady’s right hand “should be OK,” per someone close to him. Another source said simply, “He will play” after his hand was on the injury report.  — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 18, 2018     According to Pats' injury report, Brady is officially designated at questionable. He received stitches in his thumb and was cryptical when talking to the media after a limited practice session on Friday. The veteran signal-caller will be instrumental in New England’s potential success against a fearsome Jacksonville defense, as backup Brian Hoyer does not give the club much hope against that group. Brady was brilliant in a 35-14 victory over Tennessee last week, connecting on 35-of-53 passes for 337 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers. He’ll face a much tougher test in the AFC Championship Game, however, against a group that led the league in passing yards allowed (169.9 YPG) and ranked No. 2 in both total and scoring defense during the 2017 regular season. Despite those successes—and holding the Buffalo Bills to a mere three points in the Wild Card—the Jaguars did struggle to contain the explosive offense of the Steelers in the Divisional Round.  Jacksonville conceded 42 points last weekend, its second highest total of the year. Their highest allowed was 44 points, which came in a Week 16 matchup with the San Francisco 49ers, an important game where home field advantage in the playoffs and a bye were still on the line. Getting burned for 40-plus twice in a month isn’t exactly reassuring for the Jaguars, especially with New England’s top-ranked offense on tap in arguably the biggest game in franchise history.

He was burned for 12 catches and a touchdown and could have another long day against New England’s elite pass-catching backfield that loves to work in the second level. Dion Lewis and James White were targeted 17 times last week, combining to haul in 13 of those passes for 108 yards and a touchdown.    The Pats will also get Rex Burkhead back on the field in time for this upcoming game and he’s equally dangerous as a receiver. The fifth-year back played in 10 games during his first season in New England, catching 30 passes for 254 yards and three touchdowns. He’ll add another dimension to a backfield passing attack that has the potential to give the Jags fits with all the different combinations it can muster.  Ian Rapoport found that Burkhead was close to rejoining the lineup against Tennessee and will almost certainly be back in action on Sunday for the first time since Week 15:   #Patriots RB Rex Burkhead, who hasn’t played since Dec. 17 because of a knee sprain, is expected to return for the AFC title game, source said. He was close vs. the #Titans , should be good vs. the #Jaguars .  — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 15, 2018   The Jags will surely need to be better defensively than they were against Pittsburgh if they are going to make their first ever Super Bowl appearance. Jacksonville recorded two sacks, an interception and fumble recovery for a touchdown in the Divisional Round, which are strong numbers, but not incredible. The front that was responsible for 55 sacks and secondary that snagged 22 interceptions—both No. 2 in the NFL during the regular season—needs to cause even more disruption to best a prepared Patriots squad that isn’t overlooking this opponent.    Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who is expected to take a vacant head coaching job after the season, gave the scouting report on his opposition, as per the team’s official website :   They have really, really, really good players at all three levels of the defense. They're very well coached. We had an opportunity to practice against them in August, and that was apparent then and it's apparent now that they're very well-coached, rarely out of position, know what they're supposed to do in each one of their calls. They get lined up and play fast and aggressive and have got an incredibly disruptive front that's deep and talented. They've got really fast linebackers that are very disruptive that can do everything that you need linebackers to do - they run, they tackle, they cover, they turn the ball over, they blitz well - and then you've got a really, really good secondary that contests a lot of throws and makes it very difficult to have a lot of success in the passing game. So, there's nothing they don't do well. They're very talented, their scheme is difficult and they're well-coached, so this is going to be a huge challenge for us   The atmosphere at Gillette Stadium will give the Pats another advantage in the AFCCG. Rob Gronkowski, New England’s star tight end, said he was proud of how raucous the fans could get, as per NFL.com : "Our fans are always coming out. I remember last year I was watching [the AFC Championship Game, due to injury] in the stands and they were going bazooka. They were super loud. Super proud."    Doug Marrone, Jacksonville’s head coach, called Foxborough the toughest place to play in the league, as per Jaguars.com :   One time someone said, ‘What’s the toughest place to play?’ I said, ‘Gillette Stadium in New England, They go, ‘C’mon?’ I said, ‘What do you mean? Look at their record.’ It’s the most difficult place I’ve ever played.   Since 2000, the Patriots are 18-3 in the playoffs at home—a win rate of 86% that trails only the Seattle Seahawks (10-1, 91%) in that span—and 5-1 in the conference championship. New England’s last home postseason loss was five years ago in the 2013 AFC Championship against the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens, the only time New England did not win the conference as the top seed. Brady has been particularly spectacular in this position, throwing 43 touchdowns against 18 interceptions in 18 games.    NFL Research noted one trend going in favor of Jacksonville for this matchup:   Tom Brady: 286.1 pass YPG this season (1st in NFL) Jaguars Defense: 169.9 pass YPG allowed this season (1st in NFL)  This is the 4th meeting between the #1 passer and #1 pass defense in a playoff game since 1990  The #1 pass defense is 3-0 in those games  — NFL Research (@NFLResearch) January 17, 2018   The Jags haven’t had any luck since Belichick and Brady rose to prominence, losing all seven games since the turn of the millennium—including a 51-17 blowout the last time these teams met in 2015. You’d have to go all the way back to the 1999 Wild Card to find Jacksonville’s first and only victory against New England. Here’s a look at how contest since 2000 each shook out:  Patriots-Jaguars Head-to-Head (Since 2000)      Date  Result    Dec 14, 2003  NE 27 – JAX 13    Jan 7, 2006*  NE 28 – JAX 3    Dec 24, 2006  NE 24 – JAX 21    Jan 12, 2008*  NE 31 – JAX 20    Dec 27, 2009  NE 35 – JAX 7    Dec 23, 2012  NE 23 – JAX 16    Sep 27, 2015  NE 51 – JAX 17      *Playoff Game  Marrone’s lone win against the Patriots came at the tail end of the 2014 campaign, back when he was coaching the Bills, but New England was resting key players with the No. 1 seed in the AFC secure before Week 17. He’ll have a much more difficult time winning this matchup against a team that won’t hold anything back in its quest for a third title in four seasons. Expect the Jags coach to get plenty of advice from VP of football operations Tom Coughlin, who won two Super Bowl rings at New England’s expense as head coach of the New York Giants. Coughlin is 5-2 all-time against former colleague Belichick—both were on Bill Parcells’ Big Blue staff in the late 1980’s—and knows the best way to stop the modern Patriots is to keep Brady under siege, which the G-Men did in both the 2007 and 2011 Super Bowls, limiting him to an average passer rating of 60.5 and sacking him seven times in those matchups.    Marrone said he wouldn’t be relying on Coughlin anymore than he has been all season, but he admitted that has been quite a lot, as per ProFootballTalk.com :   I have leaned on Coach pretty good since day one. I don’t think I can lean on him anymore because I’m a big guy. If I lean on him, I hurt him a little. No but honestly, it’s not something that now all of a sudden that they have had success that Coach will get more involved. It’s been the same way from day one when we started working together. When you say have you leaned on him, I’ve leaned on him quite a bit. We’ve worked with each other quite a bit. We’ve worked with each other the same amount of time together and talk about the same things.   The Patriots aren’t a one-trick pony, however, and have quite an impressive defense of their own. They’ll provide quarterback Blake Bortles with plenty of looks he hasn’t seen and make life difficult for the up-and-down signal-caller. Bortles has found some success in his fourth year as the Jags starter thanks to offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett—who has designed lots of short passing plays with quick reads designed to exploit holes in coverage—but the pair will be tested like never before on Sunday. Bortles has been a fine quarterback (94.3 passer rating) when protected, but his passer rating drops significantly—down to 64.5—when the rush is bearing down. Pittsburgh was unable to capitalize on this, getting pressure on only a quarter of his drop backs in the Divisional Round. New England is coming off a franchise playoff record eight-sack performance against the Titans and had 10 sacks in the final two weeks of the regular season, indicating that this rush is firing on all cylinders at the right time.    Expect this group to give its all to get after Bortles and do its best to keep Jacksonville from getting much going through the air, but the Jags will continue to rely on star back Leonard Fournette as their first option. The star rookie out of LSU has been a game-breaker for the club, racking up 1,040 yards and nine touchdowns on 268 carries during the regular season and adding another 302 yards and a score on 36 receptions. He was instrumental in last week's win over the Steelers, shrugging off an injury to finish the day with 197 scrimmage yards and three scores on a massive 51 touches.    Will the Patriots be able to stop Fournette from running wild on them and keep Jacksonville out of the end zone with the AFC crown on the line, or will the Jags slay yet another giant as a massive underdog on Sunday? Here is Jon Price's take on the action:  Price’s Take: “The Jacksonville-New England AFC Championship could go any number of ways, but the books are predicting a relatively high score, especially for a Jaguars game. The total is set at 46.5 points, which is is the highest over/under that team has had all year. Their total last week against the Steelers nearly doubled that mark, however, and that was far from the only high scoring affair that the Jags have partaken in. They have been involved in seven games where the total eclipsed the 46.5-point mark, with four of those games occurring in the last six weeks.  These are two of the highest scoring teams in the league this year, with the Patriots ranking No. 2 by averaging 28.6 points per game and the Jags only a bit behind at No. 5 with 26.1 points per game. The Jags grind out yardage and points by running the ball, leading the NFL with 141.4 YPG on the ground during the regular season and stepping up in the playoffs with 159.5 YPG, which is by far the most of any team in this year’s postseason. Jacksonville scored 18 rushing touchdowns during the regular campaign (No. 2) and added another four on the ground in the playoffs (No. 1).    Tom Brady usually paces the New England offense through the air, but this club is also being relying on the rush in recent weeks. The Pats haven’t had fewer than 100 yards rushing since Week 15 against the Steelers and can use that to exploit a Jags defense that is most vulnerable on the ground. Jacksonville gave up a pedestrian 116.3 YPG to opposing rushers—No. 21 in the league—showing that they are beatable there.  It’s also worth noting that the Pats have gone over the total in eight of the last 11 games they have played in Foxboro. They’ve also gone over in their last four postseason outings, including last week against the Titans in which the participants narrowly eclipsed the set total of 48. For that reason I like the over as my second play of the 2018 AFC Championship Game. I think this game will have plenty of points and go back and forth for a bit until the Pats pull ahead by coming up with some key plays that only a team with as much veteran, playoff-tested talent as they possess can reliably make. The Jags just don’t have the experience or poise—especially under center—to succeed in these situations and will choke under the pressure of playing a road game in New England.  Pick: Over 46.5, Jaguars +8  Prediction: Patriots 28 – Jaguars 21       ABOUT THE AUTHOR        Alex Kay     Contributor   i                 Follow      I've been working in the realm of sports my entire career, starting as a breaking news writer right out of Arizona State University.

The Patriots are 7.5-point favorites in the NFL playoffs , down one from the opener. The line had moved as high as 9.5 before concerns over QB Tom Brady's hand send it diving. Brady returned to practice Friday, but may wear a glove on his throwing hand against the Jaguars. The Over-Under, or total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 46, down from an open of 47. Before you lock in any picks for Jaguars-Patriots, you need to see what Galin Dragiev has to say. Last week, Dragiev told SportsLine readers to back New England -13.5 over Tennessee, saying that the game would "get ugly quickly." Sure enough, the Patriots built a 21-7 halftime lead en route to a 21-point demolition. Strikingly, that improved Dragiev to 16-4 in his past 20 NFL picks , a stunning 80 percent cash rate. Anyone who has followed his advice is up big.    Part of his success: Dragiev, a daily fantasy sports specialist, learned early on to predict the outcome of the game before determining how success trickles down to individual players, so he spent more time studying team outcomes than projecting individual players. When it comes to predictions, he trusts numbers above all else. Now, he has examined every angle, every matchup and every trend in Jaguars vs. Patriots and locked in his pick. You can only see it over at SportsLine. Dragiev knows Brady's injured hand has thrown a wrinkle into the Patriots-Jaguars betting line. It required multiple stitches and the 13-time Pro Bowler missed practiced on Thursday before returning on Friday. He's officially listed as questionable and could wear a glove on his throwing hand to protect the stitches, which he's not used to doing. On Saturday, Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald Tweeted that Brady's outlook was trending up: "After thorough treatment for a few days, Tom Brady's hand is expected to be just fine tomorrow against the Jaguars, according to those around him."    And CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora added, "Tom Brady is still Tom Brady. Believe that. He's good to go. We'll all see as much tomorrow." Dragiev also knows the Jaguars rely on defense and running the ball, both of which could help them stay within the spread. The Jags were tops in the league in rushing yards at 141.4 per game, seven more than the closest team. In the postseason, their 159.5 rushing average is over 25 more than anyone else. Jaguars RB Leonard Fournette , despite missing a portion of last week's game with an ankle injury, piled up 109 yards rushing and three touchdowns against the Steelers . He's topped 100 yards from scrimmage three of the last five weeks and scored five times during that span.    SportsLine's advanced projection model says that Fournette will once again top 100 yards rushing on Sunday against New England and find the end zone. Defensively, the Jaguars were second in scoring defense (16.8 points per game) and No. 1 against the pass (169.9 yards per game). But just because the Jaguars can run the ball and play tough defense doesn't mean they'll keep it close against Brady's Pats in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Even if the Patriots are stymied through the air due to Jacksonville's defense or Brady's ailment, they've been able to run effectively. Dion Lewis had 141 yards from scrimmage against the Titans , 133 against the Jets in Week 17, and 153 against the Bills in Week 16. He had 20 catches over that span.    The Patriots will also get running back Rex Burkhead (knee) back from injury. Burkhead has six touchdowns in his past four games and gives New England another versatile player out of the backfield in the AFC title game. He has been sidelined since Dec. 17 and practiced on a limited basis all week. It's no surprise that Dragiev is leaning Under, but he knows there's a critical x-factor that determines which side of Jaguars-Patriots you need to be all over. He's only sharing his strong pick over at SportsLine. So what side of Jaguars vs. Patriots do you need to jump on in the AFC Championship Game? Visit SportsLine now to see what critical x-factor determines which side of the Jaguars-Patriots spread prevails, all from an expert on a 16-4 run in NFL picks , and find out.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Jim Rogash/Getty Images)      The 2018 AFC Championship Game matchup is finally set. The New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars will vie for a spot in the Super Bowl after successfully navigating through the Divisional Round this weekend. This game has the potential to be a truly epic one, pitting a battle-tested, veteran-laden New England squad against an upstart Jacksonville club that hadn’t made the postseason in a decade but is coming off back-to-back wins in the 2018 NFL Playoffs.  Oddsmakers are expecting the Patriots—competing in their record seventh-straight AFC Championship Game—to advance to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, opening betting with them as an 8.5-point favorite (update: the line is now NE -9). It’s not a surprise considering New England’s mastery over this opponent throughout history and its convincing victory over the Tennessee Titans on Saturday. Here’s a closer look at the upcoming contest, including the schedule, start time, opening odds, TV info and more:  2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide    Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  Jacksonville has overcome longer odds this season and had no problem taking care of business on Sunday when it upset the Pittsburgh Steelers as a seven-point underdog. The Jags had a unique advantage going into that matchup, having already beaten the Steelers at Heinz Field back in October. ESPN Stats & Info noted that Jacksonville is now 5-1 in Pittsburgh since 2004 :    The Jaguars are now 5-1 at Heinz Field since the Steelers drafted Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, including the postseason. pic.twitter.com/ify48t8aJx  — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 14, 2018   The Jaguars have not had nearly as much success against the Patriots, winning just one of 11 total games against them since coming into the league as an expansion franchise in 1995. Jacksonville’s only win against New England came all the way back in a 1999 AFC Wild Card, which was prior to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady’s arrival. Since those two began a dynasty in 2001, the Jags have lost all seven games against this opponent, a stretch that includes two postseason showdowns and an embarrassing 51-17 blowout in their last outing in 2015.    The Jaguars will again find it tough to eliminate a determined, well-coached New England team that features 41 players that participated in a combined 317 playoff games prior to this postseason, which is 30 more players and 275 more games than Jacksonville’s roster could claim. The Jaguars haven’t let that lack of playoff experience slow them down yet, however, and are now amongst the final four organizations left competing for a Super Bowl LII title.  Will the Patriots live up to expectation as chalk in the AFC Championship, or will the Jags pull off another upset on the way to an improbable Super Bowl appearance? Betting expert Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has an early take on the matter, but first check out some of the early Twitter reactions to this improbable matchup:        Page 1 / 3  Continue           Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                    NBA NFL World Football CBB NHL MLB CFB MMA WWE NASCAR Golf Tennis Boxing More Trending Mag Tickets Get The App WWE Sign Up Login NFL Playoffs Jacksonville Jaguars vs. New England Patriots: Odds, Analysis, NFL Betting Pick OddsShark.com @ @OddsShark Featured Columnist January 16, 2018  Comments Brett Carlsen/Getty Images The Jacksonville Jaguars hope to pull off a second straight road upset this postseason and get to their first-ever Super Bowl when they visit the New England Patriots in Sunday's AFC Championship Game  as big road underdogs at online betting sites . The Super Bowl champion Patriots are playing in their seventh consecutive conference title game and hosting their third in four years, going 3-3 in their previous six appearances dating back to the 2011 season.  NFL point spread: The Patriots opened as 9.5-point favorites; the total was 46 early in the week, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark. ( Line updates and matchup report ) NFL betting pick, via OddsShark computer: 29.9-16.2 Patriots ( NFL picks on every game ) Check out the OddsShark podcast on iTunes or at OddsShark.libsyn.com for more odds info, picks and a breakdown of this week's top sports betting news.  Why the Jaguars can cover the spread Jacksonville may not have the postseason experience or quarterback play of New England, but this team has just about everything else needed to get to the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have arguably more defensive talent than any of the four teams left in the playoff field, including the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC. They also have a strong running back in rookie Leonard Fournette, who rolled over the Pittsburgh Steelers with 290 rushing yards on 53 carries and five touchdowns in two wins this season, including last week's 45-42 victory in the divisional round.  Why the Patriots can cover the spread The Patriots have won each of the past seven meetings with Jacksonville straight up, going 5-2 against the spread in those games. They are also a remarkable 10-1 ATS on the NFL point spreads in their last 11 games overall and riding a seven-game home winning streak in the postseason. If those betting trends were not enough, they will have future Hall of Famer Tom Brady under center in one of the biggest positional mismatches in conference championship game history opposite Blake Bortles of the Jaguars. It is almost unthinkable to imagine Bortles possibly getting the best of Brady at Gillette Stadium with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.  Smart pick Jacksonville matched up extremely well with Pittsburgh, which is why the team won both meetings fairly easily. That will not be the case with a New England squad led by two of the all-time greats in Brady and head coach Bill Belichick . The Patriots are easily the best team remaining of the four playing for two spots in the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have been a fun story, but they will be overmatched in this spot, so look for Brady and the Patriots to flex their muscles en route to another double-digit playoff win.  NFL betting trends The Jaguars are 0-7 SU and 2-5 ATS in their last seven games against the Patriots. The total has gone under in three of the Jaguars' last four games against the Patriots. The Patriots are 10-1 ATS in their last 11 games.  All NFL odds and betting trends courtesy of Bleacher Report's official odds partner, OddsShark.

Elise Amendola/Associated Press The New England Patriots are expected to make a run at the Super Bowl nearly every year, but the Jacksonville Jaguars are virtual strangers to the AFC title game. The Jaguars have had the opportunity to play for the conference championship twice, in 1996 and 1999. They failed on both of those occasions, and they have made the playoffs just three times since, including this season. The Patriots have won two of the past three Super Bowls and are attempting to win their second title in a row and third in four years. Head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady are going for their sixth Super Bowl titles with the franchise. If that is going to happen, they are going to have to hold off the upstart Jaguars in Sunday's title game. Jacksonville won the AFC South this year, and the Jaguars edged the Buffalo Bills 10-3 in the Wild Card Game. They were expected to go down rather easily in the divisional round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Jags jumped out to a 28-7 lead and did enough in the latter portions of the game to hang on for a 45-42 victory at Heinz Field. Despite the score of that game, Jacksonville is largely dependent on its defense, a unit that ranked second in yards allowed this season. The Jaguars have an explosive pass rush, led by defensive ends Calais Campbell and Yannick Ngakoue. Those two combined for 26.5 sacks during the regular season, and if Jacksonville is going to find a way to beat the Patriots on the road, it is going to have to put significant pressure on Brady. The condition of Brady's hand could be an issue against Jacksonville. Bill Sikes/Associated Press Brady may not be 100 percent, as he suffered a bruise to his right hand in practice Wednesday and did not participate in Thursday's session. He wore a glove on his passing hand during Friday's media session, and New England listed him as questionable. The full extent of the injury is unclear, but oddsmakers have apparently been paying attention to it. The Patriots were nine-point favorites to start the gameweek, but the spread was down to 7.5 points around 48 hours before the game, according to OddsShark . The total for the game is listed at 45 points. In addition to making a wager on the game's outcome or the total, bettors can also make prop bets on the AFC Championship Game. Among the prop bets are markets on the first-half margin and the margin of victory. Bettors are offered odds if they can successfully wager on the point differential after 30 minutes. For example, a bettor who believes the Patriots will win the game by 14 points could risk $100 to bet the final margin will end up between 13 and 18 points. If that bettor is correct, they would receive a plus-400 payoff. That translates to $500, meaning the bettor gets their $100 stake back in addition to a $400 profit. A bettor who believes the Jaguars will win by 10 points can risk $100 for a plus-1200 payoff. Bettors can also wager on whether there will be a defensive or special teams touchdown. Those who bet that either one of those options take place would receive a plus-200 payoff if they are correct. Betting against either one of those happening would require a bettor to risk $260 to win $100. Bettors who believe that points will go on the board quickly could wager $100 that there will be a score in the first 5:30 of the game for a $145 payoff. Bettors would have to risk $175 to win $100 if they believe there will be no scoring in the first 5:30.

By  OddsShark    Jan 17, 2018,  8:00am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  AFC Championship 2018 odds: New England the big betting favorite against Jacksonville      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports     The New England Patriots are 7-0 straight up and 5-2 against the spread over their last seven games against the Jacksonville Jaguars . An eighth straight win over the Jaguars this Sunday would send the Patriots to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years and the eighth time in the last 17 years.  New England is a 9.5-point home favorite in Foxborough at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com. The Patriots have won by at least 11 points in each of their last five home games against the Jaguars.   Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots  When: Sunday, Jan . 21, 3:05 p.m. ET  Where: Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass .  Betting Line / Total: New England -9.5 / 46.5 Points  Jaguars at Patriots OddsShark Matchup Report   New England Patriots  Regardless of what the spread gets set at, the Patriots and their backers don’t seem to mind. New England’s 35-14 win over the Tennessee Titans last Saturday as 13.5-point favorites was the team’s third straight win and cover as a double-digit favorite and brought the Patriots’ record over their last 11 games to 10-1 SU and ATS. The Patriots have won the 10 games over that stretch by an average margin of 15.7 points per game.  The Patriots haven’t lost a playoff game at home since 2013. New England is 7-0 SU and 6-1 ATS over its last seven postseason games, per the OddsShark NFL Database .   Jacksonville Jaguars  One week after mustering up a measly 10 points at home against the Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville went into Pittsburgh on Sunday and scored 45 points en route to a stunning 45-42 win.  Leonard Fournette led the way for the Jaguars on offense with 109 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. While the offensive outburst was a nice surprise, allowing 469 passing yards and five passing touchdowns on defense doesn’t bode well ahead of a matchup against Tom Brady. Jacksonville is 2-5 SU and ATS in its last seven playoff road games.  Sunday’s total is set at 46.5 points at online sports betting sites. The UNDER is 6-1 in New England’s last seven AFC Championship game appearances.  On paper, this looks like a compelling matchup between the AFC’s best defensive team in the Jaguars and the conference’s best offensive team in the Patriots. But given New England’s history and reputation both in the postseason and against Jacksonville in recent years, it is hard to shake the feeling that the Patriots will be on their way to the big game again.

By  Louis Bien @louisbien    Jan 15, 2018,  6:51am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  The Jaguars beat the Steelers for the same reason they can beat the Patriots: They’re pissed      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports     The Jacksonville Jaguars are going to the AFC Championship to play the New England Patriots . Even after a season in which the Jags played objectively excellent football — a 10-6 record, plus-149 point differential, the eighth-best team by DVOA — that still feels weird to say.  The Jaguars have been a punchline for so long — still are a punchline , in fact — that it’s easy to assume this will all go wrong. There’s evidence that it should. NFL teams only move out of their stations with great effort. We tend to see the same teams in the playoffs every year . And especially when a good team has a mediocre quarterback, we assume that team is doomed. Hence, the Steelers were 7-point favorites.  The Jaguars beat them in a thriller Sunday. They won deservingly, in all the ways that make them a big problem for the Patriots next week. They were fast, tough, and opportunistic, embodying all of the potential that young teams have over veteran ones.  They looked Super Bowl capable, basically. Which is a long way from saying that’s where they’re going, and I say that because the Patriots have been another deviation better than everyone in the postseason this century. They should be comfortable favorites in Foxborough next week.  But the Jaguars showed Sunday why the AFC Championship should be fascinating at the very least.  The Jaguars defense has dominated the team’s story all season. For good reason — it was second in the NFL in yards allowed, points allowed, and sacks, and first in passing yards allowed. The Jags scored eight defensive touchdowns (including one against the Steelers), which is three more than any other team in the league . They have Jalen Ramsey, and Jalen Ramsey is fun and salty as hell .  Yet if the Jaguars had lost Sunday, it would have been, mostly, the defense’s fault. Not that there’s much you can do when Ben Roethlisberger is throwing passes like this ...           ... and this ...           ... on fourth downs. But, ostensibly, that should have been a disaster for a run-first Jacksonville offense poorly designed for a shootout.  Yet the Jaguars offense LIT IT UP against a good defense — ninth by DVOA. The total yardage wasn’t a lot — 378 yards to the Steelers’ 545 — but they committed zero turnovers for a second straight game and went 8 for 14 converting third downs. The Jags ran 61 plays, and only one went for a loss: Blake Bortles took a knee at the end of the first half for minus-1 yard.  Bortles himself was excellent. I know 14 of 26 doesn’t look like much, but he did it at 8.23 yards per attempt. Six of those passes were first-down throws on third down, and he picked up another with his legs. It wasn’t a mind-blowing performance, but if you had seen Bortles’ Tebow-ian game against the Bills you would have been shocked.    SB Nation’s home for all things Jacksonville Jaguars          Read more at Big Cat Country    The Steelers threw everything at the Jaguars that they can reasonably expect to see against the Patriots. Roethlisberger had 469 yards and five touchdown passes. Le’Veon Bell had 155 total yards (67 rushing and 88 receiving) and two touchdowns. Antonio Brown did damage deep — seven catches for 132 yards and two touchdowns — while tight end Vance McDonald torched the Jaguars underneath — 10 catches for 112 yards.  The Steelers — one of the best, most-balanced teams in the NFL — played near-impeccable offensive football, and lost.  And while we’re making the academic argument that the Jaguars can make the Super Bowl, it’s worth pointing out that this was the second time the Steelers lost a thriller in the last few weeks, the last being the so-called “Game Of The Year” on Dec. 17 when they fell to the Pats because of the fickle nature of the catch rule . By transitive property, the Jaguars can absolutely hang with the Patriots, and even beat them, despite what Las Vegas will have to say about it.   Full disclosure: I want the Jaguars to make it to the Super Bowl very badly. They are rough-cut and energetic. The defense plays with an abandon that actually makes it fun to watch.  They are havoc wreakers and shit talkers that dragged a relatively pedestrian, but periodically explosive offense to the playoffs, along with an equally rough-cut and energetic fan base that would be perfectly out of its element in Minnesota in February.  The Jaguars probably won’t beat the Patriots. I wouldn’t take that bet, and anyone of sound mind wouldn’t take that bet unless they literally knew nothing about NFL football beyond the last few weeks. And even then — the Patriots just tore apart a Titans team that was essentially the Jaguars lite. The Jaguars will be playing on the road against a team that has game planned for this specific moment better than any team in history.  That said, I’m not sure that these Jaguars know the odds. They do know when the other side is talking trash, though. They made that clear after their win against the Steelers .    This team is GASSED. UP. And there’s someone Malik Jackson would like to see...... #Jaguars  pic.twitter.com/BOVjUeoSDt — Alyssa Lang (@AlyssaLang) January 14, 2018     That’s defensive tackle Malik Jackson referring to Steelers safety Mike Mitchell , who guaranteed a victory this week. He wasn’t the only Steelers player to say something he probably now regrets before the game. So did the Titans’ Jurrell Casey , who coincidentally is also now back at home.  The Patriots would do well to keep quiet this week, and knowing Bill Belichick they will. The Pats may be the best-ever team at side-stepping off-field distractions, too, as evidenced by the fact that after an ESPN story about New England’s internal tensions the team — *gasp* — played one of its best games of the season.  The Jaguars, meanwhile, are ... umm ...    "We goin' to the Super Bowl. AND we gon' win that b---h" -- Jalen Ramsey to the crowd of Jaguars fans at EverBank Field pic.twitter.com/fE2jSx3Pj1 — Sports Illustrated (@SInow) January 15, 2018     Yes, you’d have to be pretty ignorant of NFL history to think the Patriots aren’t headed to their eighth Super Bowl this century. That’s beside the point.  What matters is that these Jaguars don’t know any better, and, in fact, are going to find some reason — any reason — to enter this game just as pissed off as ever before. They beat the Steelers because they are full of cuss. If they beat the Patriots, that’s exactly how they’ll do it, too.
