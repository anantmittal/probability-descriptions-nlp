Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer             Key Statistics for Lung Cancer       Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers.  How common is lung cancer?  Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer ). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.  The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:   About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)  About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)   Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon , breast, and prostate cancers combined.  Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Mostpeople diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while a very small number of people diagnosed younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.  Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer  Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower.  Black men are about 20% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 10% lower in black women than in white women. Both black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the last decade in women.  Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed. For survival statistics based on the stage of the cancer, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival Rates By Stage .  Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.  Treating occult cancer  For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.  Treating stage 0 NSCLC  Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.  If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).  In some cases, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery for stage 0 cancers. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.  Treating stage I NSCLC  If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung containing the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes within the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer cells.  Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.  For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.  After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.  If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.  Treating stage II NSCLC  People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.  Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.  In some cases, chemotherapy (often along with radiation ) may be recommend before surgery to try to shrink the tumor to make the operation easier.  After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation, sometimes along with chemo.  Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.  If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.  Treating stage IIIA NSCLC  Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.  For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy. Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.  For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.  Treating stage IIIB NSCLC  Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone.  These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.  Treating stage IV NSCLC  Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.  If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.  Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.  Cancer that has spread to only one other site  Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.  Cancer that has spread widely  For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:   For tumors that have the ALK gene change, crizotinib (Xalkori) or ceritinib (Zykadia), can often be the first treatment. Other ALK inhibitors, such as alectinib (Alecensa) or brigatinib (Alunbrig), can be used if crizotinib stops working or is not well tolerated.  For people whose cancers have certain changes in the EGFR gene, the anti-EGFR drugs erlotinib (Tarceva), gefitinib (Iressa), or afatinib (Gilotrif) may be used as the first treatment.  For people whose cancers have changes in the ROS1 gene, an ALK inhibitor such as crizotinib might be used.  For people whose cancers have a certain change in the BRAF gene, a combination of the targeted drugs dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) might be used.    Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein. Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs, so treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) might be an option as the first treatment.  For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:   The immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab might be used along with chemo in people who do not have the squamous cell type of NSCLC.  For people who are not at high risk for bleeding (that is, they do not have squamous cell NSCLC and have not coughed up blood), the targeted drug bevacizumab (Avastin) might be given with chemo. Some people with squamous cell cancer might still be given bevacizumab, as long as the tumor is not near large blood vessels in the center of the chest. If bevacizumab is used, it is often continued even after chemo is finished.  An option for people with squamous cell NSCLC is to get chemo along with the targeted drug necitumumab (Portrazza) .   If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .)  As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.  Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.  You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .  Cancer that progresses or recurs after treatment  If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms – as well as the likelihood of benefits and risks.  If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, the targeted therapy erlotinib (Tarceva), or chemo plus a targeted drug like ramucirumab (Cyramza). If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.  Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.  For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence  In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty. Managing Cancer as a Chronic Illness  talks more about this.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Before answering the question, though, it is important to talk a little about how the answer—the statistical answer—is derived. Variables That Affect Lung Cancer Survival Stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy can vary considerably among different people.         Some of these variables include: Your particular lung cancer type and location - Stage 4 lung cancer encompasses several lung cancer types and includes cancers that have spread to only one distant region or those that have spread extensively. Survival can also be affected by the genetic characteristics of the tumor , with cancers that have "targetable mutations," such as ALK-positive lung cancer , ROS1 mutations , and EGFR mutations , being more likely to respond to the newer targeted therapies for lung cancer. Your age - Younger people tend to live longer than older people with lung cancer. ( Lung cancer in young adults is different in many ways.) Your sex - The life expectancy for a woman with lung cancer is higher at each stage of lung cancer. Your general health at the time of diagnosis - Being healthy overall at the time of diagnosis is associated with a longer life expectancy, and a greater ability to withstand treatments that may extend survival.   How you respond to treatment - Side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy , surgery, targeted therapies , immunotherapy, and radiation therapy vary among different people and may limit your ability to tolerate treatment. Other health conditions you may have - Health conditions such as emphysema may lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy.         Complications of lung cancer - Complications such as blood clots can lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy. Where your lung cancer has spread - Lung cancer can spread to nearly any region of the body, but most commonly spreads to the brain, the bones, the liver, and the adrenal glands. As noted below, when only a few lung cancer brain metastases or liver metastases are present, treatment with the goal of long-term survival is sometimes possible. Statistics In addition to variations between different people, it is important to keep in mind that statistics are frequently based on people treated a few years back. For example, the most recent statistics we have for lung cancer from 2015 are based on people diagnosed with lung cancer between 2007 and 2011. Since that time, new treatments have been approved for people with advanced lung cancer, and even more treatments are being studied in clinical trials. That said, the median stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer life expectancy (the time at which 50 percent of patients are alive and 50 percent have passed away) is only around eight months. The five-year survival rate—that is, the percent of people who are expected to be alive five years after a diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer—is sadly only 4 percent.         While these numbers sound low, there are many people who are long-term survivors of stage 4 lung cancer. At the 2016 HOPE Summit in Washington, D.C. (a wonderful group of lung cancer survivors that anyone can become a part of), photos confirmed not only a group of over 300 lung cancer survivors who are thriving with lung cancer, but a double digit number group of people who have survived stage 4 disease for at least 10 years. Remember: You are not a statistic. There is hope, and it is not false hope. Managing Lung Cancer That Has Spread (Stage 4) One last thing is very important to keep in mind.  While stage 4 lung cancer is not usually curable, it is treatable. These treatments may not only improve survival but help with the symptoms of lung cancer as well. For some people, the approval of two immunotherapy drugs in 2015 (and other medications in this category being evaluated in clinical trials) suggests that for some people, long-term control of the disease for some people with advanced lung cancer may be possible. For people with targeted mutations, switching to newly developed drugs when tumors become resistant suggests that for some people, advanced lung cancer may be treated as a chronic disease, such as diabetes in the future. Another recent advance for lung cancer that has spread is the treatment of " oligometastases ." When a single—or only a few—metastases are present, for example, in the brain or the liver, techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT ) may be used to eliminate these metastases. This technique has even resulted in long-term survival for some people with brain metastases from lung cancer . What Can You Do to Improve Your Survival? After many years of little progress in the treatment of lung cancer, options for treating and personalizing lung cancer care have increased exponentially. What this means is that it is hard for anyone—even an oncologist who specializes in cancer—to be aware of every new advance and clinical trial being conducted around the globe. Studies suggest that people who learn as much about their cancer and become their own advocate in their cancer care may have better outcomes. An excellent way to not only receive support but to find out about the latest advances in treatment is to become involved in a lung cancer support group or support community . The hashtag for these groups is #LCSM, which stands for lung cancer social media. In addition, several of the lung cancer organizations have joined together to provide a free clinical trial matching service for those living with lung cancer. Take a moment to check out these tips on advocating for yourself as a cancer patient whether you are living with lung cancer yourself or facing lung cancer together with a loved one.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer             Key Statistics for Lung Cancer       Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers.  How common is lung cancer?  Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer ). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.  The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:   About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)  About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)   Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon , breast, and prostate cancers combined.  Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Mostpeople diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while a very small number of people diagnosed younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.  Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer  Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower.  Black men are about 20% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 10% lower in black women than in white women. Both black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the last decade in women.  Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed. For survival statistics based on the stage of the cancer, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival Rates By Stage .  Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

To understand how lung cancer starts, different types, how it affects your body and other lung cancer basics, visit our Learn About Lung Cancer section .    Mortality     Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. 1  An estimated 158,080 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. 2  The number of deaths caused by lung cancer peaked at 159,292 in 2005 and has since decreased by 2.3 percent to 155,610 in 2014. 1  The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer is higher for men (51.7 per 100,000 persons) than for women (34.7 per 100,000 persons). It is similar for blacks (45.7 per 100,000 persons) and whites (45.4 per 100,000 persons) overall. However, black men have a far higher age-adjusted lung cancer death rate than white men, while black and white women have similar rates. 1       Prevalence and Incidence     Approximately 415,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. 3  During 2016, an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed, representing about 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 2  The majority of living lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within the last five years. Lung cancer is mostly a disease of the elderly. In 2013, 83 percent of those living with lung cancer were 60 years of age or older. 3  In 2013, Kentucky had the highest age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates in both men (113.2 per 100,000) and women (78.3 per 100,000). Utah had the lowest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in both men and women (30.0 per 100,000 and 22.9 per 100,000, respectively). 4 These state-specific rates were parallel to smoking prevalence rates.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. 5  The National Institutes of Health estimate that cancer care cost the U.S. an overall $147.5 billion in 2015, $13.4 billion of which is due to lung cancer. Lost productivity due to early death from cancer lead to an additional $134.8 billion in 2005, $36.1 billion of which was caused by lung cancer. 6       Gender Differences     More men are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, but more women live with the disease. The rate of new cases in 2013 showed that men develop lung cancer more often than women (60.7 and 47.7 per 100,000, respectively). 3  The rate of new lung cancer cases (incidence) over the past 39 years has dropped 32 percent for men while it has risen 94 percent for women . In 1975, rates were low for women, but rising for both men and women. In 1984, the rate of new cases for men peaked (102.1 per 100,000) and then began declining. The rate of new cases for women increased further, did not peak until 1998 (52.9 per 100,000), and has now started to decline. 3       Racial/Ethnic Differences     Black men and women are more likely to develop and die from lung cancer than persons of any other racial or ethnic group. The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among black men is approximately 28 percent higher than for white men, even though their overall exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor for lung cancer, is lower. 3, 7  The lung cancer incidence rate for black women is roughly equal to that of white women, despite the fact that they smoke fewer cigarettes. 3, 7       Survival Rates     What Does Survival Rate Mean?  Doctors use lung cancer survival rates or survival statistics to tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type and stage of cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on population averages and is not a predictor of how long any one individual diagnosed with cancer will live. Learn more .    The lung cancer five-year survival rate (17.7 percent) is lower than many other leading cancer sites, such as the colon (64.4 percent), breast (89.7 percent) and prostate (98.9 percent). 3  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 55 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized (within the lungs). However, only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors (spread to other organs) the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent. 3  More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. 3        Screening and Early Detection     Screening for individuals at high risk has the potential to dramatically improve lung cancer survival rates by finding the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage.  A 2011 study found that screening high risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent compared to chest X-ray. 8  At least 8.6 million Americans qualify as high risk for lung cancer and are recommended to receive annual screening with low-dose CT scans. 9  If half of these high risk individuals were screened, over 13,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented. 8,9       Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer     Smoking , a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 10  Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year. 11  Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work. 12       Other Causes     It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 13  Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second-leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colorless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon. 14  Lung cancer can also be caused by occupational exposures, including asbestos , uranium and coke (an important fuel in the manufacture of iron in smelters, blast furnaces and foundries). The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. 15  Nonsmoking asbes­tos workers are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than non­smokers not ex­posed to asbestos; if they also smoke, the risk factor jumps to 50 or higher. 13 Environmental exposures also can increase the risk of lung cancer death. 16     For more information, please review the Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality Trend Report call the Lung HelpLine at1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872).

So, what percentage of smokers actually get lung cancer? How much does that risk decrease if you quit? Smoking and Lung Cancer Most statistics look at the overall risk of lung cancer , combining both people who smoke and those who have never smoked. Based on United States statistics, the lifetime risk that a person will develop lung cancer is 6.4 percent or a little greater than one out of every 15 people.         Clearly, this number would be higher for those who have smoked and lower for those who haven't. We have very few studies which have broken these numbers down between never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers, but an older 2006 European study did make these distinctions. In that study, the risk of developing lung cancer was: 0.2 percent for men who never smoked; 0.4 percent for women 5.5 percent of male former smokers; 2.6 percent in women 15.9 percent of current male smokers; 9.5 percent for women 24.4 percent for male “heavy smokers” defined as smoking more than five cigarettes per day; 18.5 percent for women An earlier Canadian study quoted the lifetime risk for male smokers at 17.2 percent and 11.6 percent in women versus only 1.3 percent in male non-smokers and 1.4 percent in female non-smokers . Leading Cause of Cancer-Related Deaths To properly address why this question is so important, it's important to point out that smoking is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the United States.   One out of four cancer deaths is due to lung cancer and lung cancer kills more people than breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer combined. Of these cancers, it's thought that at least 80 percent can be attributed to smoking. There are many chemicals in cigarettes that are known to cause cancer and more which are considered toxic to humans.         It's not only lung cancer, however. There are many cancers which are caused by smoking . And it's not just smoking that's a problem, it's thought that roughly 7300 people die from lung cancer each year caused by second-hand smoke. Lung Cancer Risk in People Who Smoke It appears that the earlier in life you begin smoking, the higher your risk of developing lung cancer. Your risk also depends on the number of “ pack-years ” you have smoked. A pack-year is a number that is calculated by multiplying the number of years smoked times the number of packs of cigarettes smoked daily. Quitting smoking lowers the risk of lung cancer, but it can take some time before your risk decreases. If you have smoked for more than a short period of time, your risk will never reach that of a never smoker. But, it is still very worth the effort to quit. Researchers looking at people in Asia and Australia found that people could reduce their risk of developing lung cancer by up to 70 percent by quitting smoking. In one estimate, a 68-year-old man who had smoked two packs per day for 50 years (100 pack-years) had a 15 percent risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years if he continued to smoke. This risk would drop to 10.8 percent if he quit smoking.         You may also be wondering how cutting down but not quitting impacts risk. In one study, it was found that people who smoked more than 15 cigarettes per day could significantly lower their risk if they cut the number of cigarettes they smoked daily in half. Another study was less positive about the cutting down approach and suggested that quitting altogether was necessary to bring about a significant difference in risk. Lung Cancer in Former Smokers As noted above, the risk of lung cancer rarely returns to normal when a person quits smoking. In fact, roughly 80 percent of people who develop lung cancer today are non-smokers; they either never smoked or more commonly quit smoking in the past (are former smokers.)  Predicting Risk While it is impossible to truly predict who will develop lung cancer, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has developed a Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool in which you can calculate your average risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years based on your age and how long you had or have smoked. The tool is designed for people between the ages of 50 and 75 who smoked between 10 and 60 cigarettes daily for a period of 25 and 55 years. It is preceded by a disclaimer that reminds individuals that the tool is only a prediction based on statistics and does not mean someone will or will not develop lung cancer. Screening Until recently, there had not been an effective screening test for lung cancer. People needed to rely on an awareness of the early symptoms of lung cancer in hope of finding the disease in the early and most treatable stages of the disease. Since nearly half of people are diagnosed when their lung cancer is already in the advanced stages, a knowledge of symptoms alone isn't enough. Thankfully—for some people at least— CT lung cancer screening has been approved and, when used according to guidelines, may decrease the mortality from lung cancer by 20 percent in the United States. People eligible for screening include those who: Are between the ages of 55 and 80 Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking Continue to smoke or quit smoking in the past 15 years Are in reasonable physical condition such that surgery could be done if a mass is found There are other people who may wish to be screened as well. For example, those who have been exposed to cancer-causing substances in the work place. If you feel you may be at risk, talk to your doctor. Even if you smoked, it's not too late to do other things to lower your risk of developing lung cancer . A Word From Verywell If you smoke or have smoked you might be feeling discouraged. It might help to look at these statistics from a different angle. Instead of fretting that your risk of lung cancer doesn't disappear, you might instead focus on the fact that 10 years after quitting your risk is only half of what it is today. It is never too late to quit. Even for those who have cancer, quitting can make a difference. You might be interested in checking out these reasons to quit smoking after a diagnosis of cancer . In addition to giving up the habit, there are other ways you can reduce your chances of dying from cancer. Eating healthy, having an active lifestyle, and getting screened if you qualify can all help.

Smoking  Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancers. Using other tobacco products such as cigars or pipes also increases the risk for lung cancer. Tobacco smoke is a toxic mix of more than 7,000 chemicals. Many are poisons. At least 70 are known to cause cancer in people or animals.  People who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day, the more risk goes up.  People who quit smoking have a lower risk of lung cancer than if they had continued to smoke, but their risk is higher than the risk for people who never smoked. Quitting smoking at any age can lower the risk of lung cancer.  Cigarette smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in the body. Cigarette smoking causes cancer of the mouth and throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, voicebox (larynx), trachea, bronchus, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and cervix, and causes acute myeloid leukemia.   Secondhand Smoke  Smoke from other people’s cigarettes, pipes, or cigars ( secondhand smoke ) also causes lung cancer. When a person breathes in secondhand smoke, it is like he or she is smoking. In the United States, two out of five adults who don’t smoke and half of children are exposed to secondhand smoke, and about 7,300 people who never smoked die from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke every year.   Radon  Radon is a naturally occurring gas that comes from rocks and dirt and can get trapped in houses and buildings. It cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon causes about 20,000 cases of lung cancer each year, making it the second leading cause of lung cancer. Nearly one out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is thought to have high radon levels. The EPA recommends testing homes for radon and using proven ways to lower high radon levels.  Other Substances  Examples of substances found at some workplaces that increase risk include asbestos,  arsenic,  diesel exhaust, and some forms of silica and chromium. For many of these substances, the risk of getting lung cancer is even higher for those who smoke.   Personal or Family History of Lung Cancer  If you are a lung cancer survivor, there is a risk that you may develop another lung cancer, especially if you smoke. Your risk of lung cancer may be higher if your parents, brothers or sisters, or children have had lung cancer. This could be true because they also smoke, or they live or work in the same place where they are exposed to radon and other substances that can cause lung cancer.   Radiation Therapy to the Chest  Cancer survivors who had radiation therapy to the chest are at higher risk of lung cancer.   Diet  Scientists are studying many different foods and dietary supplements to see whether they change the risk of getting lung cancer. There is much we still need to know. We do know that smokers who take beta-carotene supplements have increased risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit Lung Cancer Prevention.  Also, arsenic in drinking water (primarily from private wells) can increase the risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit the EPA’s Arsenic in Drinking Water.       What Is Lung Cancer?

Author information 1 Bureau of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, Ontario. Abstract Life table methodology was used to estimate the probability of developing lung cancer by smoking status. Lifetime risks of developing lung cancer were estimated for six hypothetical cohorts (males, females, male current smokers, male never smokers, female current smokers, and female never smokers). Estimates of smoking mortality and incidence rates were calculated based on Canadian rates observed over the period 1987 to 1989. It was found that 172/1,000 of male current smokers will eventually develop lung cancer; the similar probability among female current smokers was 116/1,000. For those who never smoked on a regular basis the lifetime risk was substantially reduced. Only 13/1,000 males and 14/1,000 females in this category will develop lung cancer. When smoking status is not adjusted for, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is approximately 96/1,000 and 43/1,000 for males and females respectively.

Our experts developed a screening decision tool to help you better understand your risk.  Learn more     Smoking, the number one cause of preventable death in the United States, causes 130,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Many smokers are now considering screening with low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scans in the hope of diagnosing the disease early. A new study that shows lung cancer risk varies widely among smokers may help individuals and their doctors decide if voluntary screening is appropriate for them.  Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center analyzed data from a large lung cancer prevention study and found that the risk of developing lung cancer can be accurately predicted based on a person’s age, sex, and smoking history. These factors accounted for an individual’s 10-year risk for developing lung cancer which ranged from a low of less than 1% to a high of 16%. The study, along with an interactive lung cancer risk prediction tool, is published in the March 19 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute .  “The risk assessment tool should help physicians and patients balance the possible risks and benefits of screening,” explained Peter Bach , M.D. of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the study’s first author. “For example, the subjects in our study who were at the low end of risk had less than a 1% chance of getting lung cancer in the next ten years. That needs to be contrasted with the 30 to 50 percent risk that a screening CT will show some lung scar or shadow that requires further evaluation or surgical biopsy, even though it will ultimately be deemed to be harmless.  “The researchers reviewed the information from a lung cancer prevention study called the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) conducted by investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. This randomized, multi-center trial looked at the effect of beta-carotene and Vitamin A supplements on lung cancer prevention in 18,314 people. The subjects included 14,254 men and women aged 50 to 69 who were considered heavy smokers - defined as having smoked at least one pack per day for 20 years and who were either current smokers or had stopped smoking within 6 years prior to enrolling in the study. The remaining 4060 participants were asbestos exposed men aged 45 to 69 who were either current smokers or former smokers who quit within 15 years of enrollment. The trial was terminated in 1996 after preliminary results indicated no benefit and possible harm from the supplements among individuals who continued to smoke cigarettes.  For the new study, the data from 18,172 subjects in the CARET trial who had a history of current or former smoking were used to create a mathematical model that predicts the likelihood that an individual will be diagnosed with lung cancer within the next ten years.For the risk prediction model, the duration of smoking, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of abstinence, and age turned out to be the main factors that determined the probability of an individual being diagnosed with lung cancer. Looking at examples from people undergoing lung cancer screening, a 51-year-old woman who smoked one pack per day for 29 years but stopped smoking 9 years earlier had a 0.8% (less than 1 in a 100) risk of getting lung cancer in the next ten years while a 68-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years and continued to smoke had a 15% (1 out of 7) chance of developing the disease in the same time period.  “Our findings suggest that accurate risk prediction may also be useful for researchers designing clinical trials of early lung cancer diagnosis,” said Colin Begg , Ph.D., chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and senior author of the study. “For example, focusing on the truly high-risk individuals may allow for more effective clinical trials of lung cancer screening and prevention.”  Mark G. Kris , M.D., chief of Thoracic Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering and one of the study’s co-authors, believes the new model will be a valuable tool in assessing risk. “Using the new model, we have a much better way to predict who is at high risk for developing lung cancer and, equally important, who is at a lower risk. With more than 90 million current and former smokers in the U.S., we need an accurate way to identify those individuals at exceptionally high risk who have the most to gain from screening.”  The study’s co-authors include Michael W. Kattan, Ph.D., Ramsey C. Tate and Lillian J. Hsieh of Memorial Sloan Kettering; Mark D. Thornquist, Ph.D. and Matt J. Barnett, M.S. of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The study was funded by the “Steps for Breath Fund” from The Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering and by a Public Health Service grant from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer             Key Statistics for Lung Cancer       Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers.  How common is lung cancer?  Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer ). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.  The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:   About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)  About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)   Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon , breast, and prostate cancers combined.  Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Mostpeople diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while a very small number of people diagnosed younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.  Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer  Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower.  Black men are about 20% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 10% lower in black women than in white women. Both black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the last decade in women.  Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed. For survival statistics based on the stage of the cancer, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival Rates By Stage .  Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.  Treating occult cancer  For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.  Treating stage 0 NSCLC  Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.  If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).  In some cases, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery for stage 0 cancers. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.  Treating stage I NSCLC  If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung containing the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes within the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer cells.  Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.  For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.  After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.  If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.  Treating stage II NSCLC  People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.  Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.  In some cases, chemotherapy (often along with radiation ) may be recommend before surgery to try to shrink the tumor to make the operation easier.  After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation, sometimes along with chemo.  Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.  If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.  Treating stage IIIA NSCLC  Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.  For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy. Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.  For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.  Treating stage IIIB NSCLC  Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone.  These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.  Treating stage IV NSCLC  Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.  If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.  Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.  Cancer that has spread to only one other site  Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.  Cancer that has spread widely  For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:   For tumors that have the ALK gene change, crizotinib (Xalkori) or ceritinib (Zykadia), can often be the first treatment. Other ALK inhibitors, such as alectinib (Alecensa) or brigatinib (Alunbrig), can be used if crizotinib stops working or is not well tolerated.  For people whose cancers have certain changes in the EGFR gene, the anti-EGFR drugs erlotinib (Tarceva), gefitinib (Iressa), or afatinib (Gilotrif) may be used as the first treatment.  For people whose cancers have changes in the ROS1 gene, an ALK inhibitor such as crizotinib might be used.  For people whose cancers have a certain change in the BRAF gene, a combination of the targeted drugs dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) might be used.    Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein. Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs, so treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) might be an option as the first treatment.  For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:   The immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab might be used along with chemo in people who do not have the squamous cell type of NSCLC.  For people who are not at high risk for bleeding (that is, they do not have squamous cell NSCLC and have not coughed up blood), the targeted drug bevacizumab (Avastin) might be given with chemo. Some people with squamous cell cancer might still be given bevacizumab, as long as the tumor is not near large blood vessels in the center of the chest. If bevacizumab is used, it is often continued even after chemo is finished.  An option for people with squamous cell NSCLC is to get chemo along with the targeted drug necitumumab (Portrazza) .   If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .)  As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.  Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.  You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .  Cancer that progresses or recurs after treatment  If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms – as well as the likelihood of benefits and risks.  If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, the targeted therapy erlotinib (Tarceva), or chemo plus a targeted drug like ramucirumab (Cyramza). If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.  Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.  For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence  In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty. Managing Cancer as a Chronic Illness  talks more about this.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Before answering the question, though, it is important to talk a little about how the answer—the statistical answer—is derived. Variables That Affect Lung Cancer Survival Stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy can vary considerably among different people.         Some of these variables include: Your particular lung cancer type and location - Stage 4 lung cancer encompasses several lung cancer types and includes cancers that have spread to only one distant region or those that have spread extensively. Survival can also be affected by the genetic characteristics of the tumor , with cancers that have "targetable mutations," such as ALK-positive lung cancer , ROS1 mutations , and EGFR mutations , being more likely to respond to the newer targeted therapies for lung cancer. Your age - Younger people tend to live longer than older people with lung cancer. ( Lung cancer in young adults is different in many ways.) Your sex - The life expectancy for a woman with lung cancer is higher at each stage of lung cancer. Your general health at the time of diagnosis - Being healthy overall at the time of diagnosis is associated with a longer life expectancy, and a greater ability to withstand treatments that may extend survival.   How you respond to treatment - Side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy , surgery, targeted therapies , immunotherapy, and radiation therapy vary among different people and may limit your ability to tolerate treatment. Other health conditions you may have - Health conditions such as emphysema may lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy.         Complications of lung cancer - Complications such as blood clots can lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy. Where your lung cancer has spread - Lung cancer can spread to nearly any region of the body, but most commonly spreads to the brain, the bones, the liver, and the adrenal glands. As noted below, when only a few lung cancer brain metastases or liver metastases are present, treatment with the goal of long-term survival is sometimes possible. Statistics In addition to variations between different people, it is important to keep in mind that statistics are frequently based on people treated a few years back. For example, the most recent statistics we have for lung cancer from 2015 are based on people diagnosed with lung cancer between 2007 and 2011. Since that time, new treatments have been approved for people with advanced lung cancer, and even more treatments are being studied in clinical trials. That said, the median stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer life expectancy (the time at which 50 percent of patients are alive and 50 percent have passed away) is only around eight months. The five-year survival rate—that is, the percent of people who are expected to be alive five years after a diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer—is sadly only 4 percent.         While these numbers sound low, there are many people who are long-term survivors of stage 4 lung cancer. At the 2016 HOPE Summit in Washington, D.C. (a wonderful group of lung cancer survivors that anyone can become a part of), photos confirmed not only a group of over 300 lung cancer survivors who are thriving with lung cancer, but a double digit number group of people who have survived stage 4 disease for at least 10 years. Remember: You are not a statistic. There is hope, and it is not false hope. Managing Lung Cancer That Has Spread (Stage 4) One last thing is very important to keep in mind.  While stage 4 lung cancer is not usually curable, it is treatable. These treatments may not only improve survival but help with the symptoms of lung cancer as well. For some people, the approval of two immunotherapy drugs in 2015 (and other medications in this category being evaluated in clinical trials) suggests that for some people, long-term control of the disease for some people with advanced lung cancer may be possible. For people with targeted mutations, switching to newly developed drugs when tumors become resistant suggests that for some people, advanced lung cancer may be treated as a chronic disease, such as diabetes in the future. Another recent advance for lung cancer that has spread is the treatment of " oligometastases ." When a single—or only a few—metastases are present, for example, in the brain or the liver, techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT ) may be used to eliminate these metastases. This technique has even resulted in long-term survival for some people with brain metastases from lung cancer . What Can You Do to Improve Your Survival? After many years of little progress in the treatment of lung cancer, options for treating and personalizing lung cancer care have increased exponentially. What this means is that it is hard for anyone—even an oncologist who specializes in cancer—to be aware of every new advance and clinical trial being conducted around the globe. Studies suggest that people who learn as much about their cancer and become their own advocate in their cancer care may have better outcomes. An excellent way to not only receive support but to find out about the latest advances in treatment is to become involved in a lung cancer support group or support community . The hashtag for these groups is #LCSM, which stands for lung cancer social media. In addition, several of the lung cancer organizations have joined together to provide a free clinical trial matching service for those living with lung cancer.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer             Key Statistics for Lung Cancer       Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers.  How common is lung cancer?  Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer ). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.  The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:   About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)  About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)   Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon , breast, and prostate cancers combined.  Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Mostpeople diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while a very small number of people diagnosed younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.  Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer  Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower.  Black men are about 20% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 10% lower in black women than in white women. Both black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the last decade in women.  Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed. For survival statistics based on the stage of the cancer, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival Rates By Stage .  Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

To understand how lung cancer starts, different types, how it affects your body and other lung cancer basics, visit our Learn About Lung Cancer section .    Mortality     Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. 1  An estimated 158,080 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. 2  The number of deaths caused by lung cancer peaked at 159,292 in 2005 and has since decreased by 2.3 percent to 155,610 in 2014. 1  The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer is higher for men (51.7 per 100,000 persons) than for women (34.7 per 100,000 persons). It is similar for blacks (45.7 per 100,000 persons) and whites (45.4 per 100,000 persons) overall. However, black men have a far higher age-adjusted lung cancer death rate than white men, while black and white women have similar rates. 1       Prevalence and Incidence     Approximately 415,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. 3  During 2016, an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed, representing about 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 2  The majority of living lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within the last five years. Lung cancer is mostly a disease of the elderly. In 2013, 83 percent of those living with lung cancer were 60 years of age or older. 3  In 2013, Kentucky had the highest age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates in both men (113.2 per 100,000) and women (78.3 per 100,000). Utah had the lowest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in both men and women (30.0 per 100,000 and 22.9 per 100,000, respectively). 4 These state-specific rates were parallel to smoking prevalence rates.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. 5  The National Institutes of Health estimate that cancer care cost the U.S. an overall $147.5 billion in 2015, $13.4 billion of which is due to lung cancer. Lost productivity due to early death from cancer lead to an additional $134.8 billion in 2005, $36.1 billion of which was caused by lung cancer. 6       Gender Differences     More men are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, but more women live with the disease. The rate of new cases in 2013 showed that men develop lung cancer more often than women (60.7 and 47.7 per 100,000, respectively). 3  The rate of new lung cancer cases (incidence) over the past 39 years has dropped 32 percent for men while it has risen 94 percent for women . In 1975, rates were low for women, but rising for both men and women. In 1984, the rate of new cases for men peaked (102.1 per 100,000) and then began declining. The rate of new cases for women increased further, did not peak until 1998 (52.9 per 100,000), and has now started to decline. 3       Racial/Ethnic Differences     Black men and women are more likely to develop and die from lung cancer than persons of any other racial or ethnic group. The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among black men is approximately 28 percent higher than for white men, even though their overall exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor for lung cancer, is lower. 3, 7  The lung cancer incidence rate for black women is roughly equal to that of white women, despite the fact that they smoke fewer cigarettes. 3, 7       Survival Rates     What Does Survival Rate Mean?  Doctors use lung cancer survival rates or survival statistics to tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type and stage of cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on population averages and is not a predictor of how long any one individual diagnosed with cancer will live. Learn more .    The lung cancer five-year survival rate (17.7 percent) is lower than many other leading cancer sites, such as the colon (64.4 percent), breast (89.7 percent) and prostate (98.9 percent). 3  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 55 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized (within the lungs). However, only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors (spread to other organs) the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent. 3  More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. 3        Screening and Early Detection     Screening for individuals at high risk has the potential to dramatically improve lung cancer survival rates by finding the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage.  A 2011 study found that screening high risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent compared to chest X-ray. 8  At least 8.6 million Americans qualify as high risk for lung cancer and are recommended to receive annual screening with low-dose CT scans. 9  If half of these high risk individuals were screened, over 13,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented. 8,9       Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer     Smoking , a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 10  Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year. 11  Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work. 12       Other Causes     It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 13  Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second-leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colorless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon. 14  Lung cancer can also be caused by occupational exposures, including asbestos , uranium and coke (an important fuel in the manufacture of iron in smelters, blast furnaces and foundries). The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. 15  Nonsmoking asbes­tos workers are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than non­smokers not ex­posed to asbestos; if they also smoke, the risk factor jumps to 50 or higher. 13 Environmental exposures also can increase the risk of lung cancer death. 16     For more information, please review the Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality Trend Report call the Lung HelpLine at1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872).

More in Lung Cancer        Causes & Risk Factors       Non-Small Cell     Small Cell     Symptoms     Diagnosis     Treatment     Living With     Support & Coping        We know that smoking causes lung cancer, but it’s also clear that some people smoke their whole lives and never develop lung cancer. So, what percentage of smokers actually get lung cancer? How much does that risk decrease if you quit? Smoking and Lung Cancer Most statistics look at the overall risk of lung cancer , combining both people who smoke and those who have never smoked. Based on United States statistics, the lifetime risk that a person will develop lung cancer is 6.4 percent or a little greater than one out of every 15 people.         Clearly, this number would be higher for those who have smoked and lower for those who haven't. We have very few studies which have broken these numbers down between never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers, but an older 2006 European study did make these distinctions. In that study, the risk of developing lung cancer was: 0.2 percent for men who never smoked; 0.4 percent for women 5.5 percent of male former smokers; 2.6 percent in women 15.9 percent of current male smokers; 9.5 percent for women 24.4 percent for male “heavy smokers” defined as smoking more than five cigarettes per day; 18.5 percent for women An earlier Canadian study quoted the lifetime risk for male smokers at 17.2 percent and 11.6 percent in women versus only 1.3 percent in male non-smokers and 1.4 percent in female non-smokers . Leading Cause of Cancer-Related Deaths To properly address why this question is so important, it's important to point out that smoking is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the United States.   One out of four cancer deaths is due to lung cancer and lung cancer kills more people than breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer combined. Of these cancers, it's thought that at least 80 percent can be attributed to smoking. There are many chemicals in cigarettes that are known to cause cancer and more which are considered toxic to humans.         It's not only lung cancer, however. There are many cancers which are caused by smoking . And it's not just smoking that's a problem, it's thought that roughly 7300 people die from lung cancer each year caused by second-hand smoke. Lung Cancer Risk in People Who Smoke It appears that the earlier in life you begin smoking, the higher your risk of developing lung cancer. Your risk also depends on the number of “ pack-years ” you have smoked. A pack-year is a number that is calculated by multiplying the number of years smoked times the number of packs of cigarettes smoked daily. Quitting smoking lowers the risk of lung cancer, but it can take some time before your risk decreases. If you have smoked for more than a short period of time, your risk will never reach that of a never smoker. But, it is still very worth the effort to quit. Researchers looking at people in Asia and Australia found that people could reduce their risk of developing lung cancer by up to 70 percent by quitting smoking. In one estimate, a 68-year-old man who had smoked two packs per day for 50 years (100 pack-years) had a 15 percent risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years if he continued to smoke. This risk would drop to 10.8 percent if he quit smoking.         You may also be wondering how cutting down but not quitting impacts risk. In one study, it was found that people who smoked more than 15 cigarettes per day could significantly lower their risk if they cut the number of cigarettes they smoked daily in half. Another study was less positive about the cutting down approach and suggested that quitting altogether was necessary to bring about a significant difference in risk. Lung Cancer in Former Smokers As noted above, the risk of lung cancer rarely returns to normal when a person quits smoking. In fact, roughly 80 percent of people who develop lung cancer today are non-smokers; they either never smoked or more commonly quit smoking in the past (are former smokers.)  Predicting Risk While it is impossible to truly predict who will develop lung cancer, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has developed a Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool in which you can calculate your average risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years based on your age and how long you had or have smoked. The tool is designed for people between the ages of 50 and 75 who smoked between 10 and 60 cigarettes daily for a period of 25 and 55 years. It is preceded by a disclaimer that reminds individuals that the tool is only a prediction based on statistics and does not mean someone will or will not develop lung cancer. Screening Until recently, there had not been an effective screening test for lung cancer. People needed to rely on an awareness of the early symptoms of lung cancer in hope of finding the disease in the early and most treatable stages of the disease. Since nearly half of people are diagnosed when their lung cancer is already in the advanced stages, a knowledge of symptoms alone isn't enough. Thankfully—for some people at least— CT lung cancer screening has been approved and, when used according to guidelines, may decrease the mortality from lung cancer by 20 percent in the United States. People eligible for screening include those who: Are between the ages of 55 and 80 Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking Continue to smoke or quit smoking in the past 15 years Are in reasonable physical condition such that surgery could be done if a mass is found There are other people who may wish to be screened as well. For example, those who have been exposed to cancer-causing substances in the work place. If you feel you may be at risk, talk to your doctor. Even if you smoked, it's not too late to do other things to lower your risk of developing lung cancer . A Word From Verywell If you smoke or have smoked you might be feeling discouraged. It might help to look at these statistics from a different angle. Instead of fretting that your risk of lung cancer doesn't disappear, you might instead focus on the fact that 10 years after quitting your risk is only half of what it is today. It is never too late to quit. Even for those who have cancer, quitting can make a difference. You might be interested in checking out these reasons to quit smoking after a diagnosis of cancer . In addition to giving up the habit, there are other ways you can reduce your chances of dying from cancer. Eating healthy, having an active lifestyle, and getting screened if you qualify can all help.

Visit smokefree.gov   Call 1 (800) QUIT-NOW  Text “QUIT” to 47848 from your cell phone   Research has found several risk factors that may increase your chances of getting lung cancer.  Smoking  Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancers. Using other tobacco products such as cigars or pipes also increases the risk for lung cancer. Tobacco smoke is a toxic mix of more than 7,000 chemicals. Many are poisons. At least 70 are known to cause cancer in people or animals.  People who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day, the more risk goes up.  People who quit smoking have a lower risk of lung cancer than if they had continued to smoke, but their risk is higher than the risk for people who never smoked. Quitting smoking at any age can lower the risk of lung cancer.  Cigarette smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in the body. Cigarette smoking causes cancer of the mouth and throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, voicebox (larynx), trachea, bronchus, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and cervix, and causes acute myeloid leukemia.   Secondhand Smoke  Smoke from other people’s cigarettes, pipes, or cigars ( secondhand smoke ) also causes lung cancer. When a person breathes in secondhand smoke, it is like he or she is smoking. In the United States, two out of five adults who don’t smoke and half of children are exposed to secondhand smoke, and about 7,300 people who never smoked die from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke every year.   Radon  Radon is a naturally occurring gas that comes from rocks and dirt and can get trapped in houses and buildings. It cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon causes about 20,000 cases of lung cancer each year, making it the second leading cause of lung cancer. Nearly one out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is thought to have high radon levels. The EPA recommends testing homes for radon and using proven ways to lower high radon levels.  Other Substances  Examples of substances found at some workplaces that increase risk include asbestos,  arsenic,  diesel exhaust, and some forms of silica and chromium. For many of these substances, the risk of getting lung cancer is even higher for those who smoke.   Personal or Family History of Lung Cancer  If you are a lung cancer survivor, there is a risk that you may develop another lung cancer, especially if you smoke. Your risk of lung cancer may be higher if your parents, brothers or sisters, or children have had lung cancer. This could be true because they also smoke, or they live or work in the same place where they are exposed to radon and other substances that can cause lung cancer.   Radiation Therapy to the Chest  Cancer survivors who had radiation therapy to the chest are at higher risk of lung cancer.   Diet  Scientists are studying many different foods and dietary supplements to see whether they change the risk of getting lung cancer. There is much we still need to know. We do know that smokers who take beta-carotene supplements have increased risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit Lung Cancer Prevention.  Also, arsenic in drinking water (primarily from private wells) can increase the risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit the EPA’s Arsenic in Drinking Water.       What Is Lung Cancer?

Author information 1 Bureau of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, Ontario. Abstract Life table methodology was used to estimate the probability of developing lung cancer by smoking status. Lifetime risks of developing lung cancer were estimated for six hypothetical cohorts (males, females, male current smokers, male never smokers, female current smokers, and female never smokers). Estimates of smoking mortality and incidence rates were calculated based on Canadian rates observed over the period 1987 to 1989. It was found that 172/1,000 of male current smokers will eventually develop lung cancer; the similar probability among female current smokers was 116/1,000. For those who never smoked on a regular basis the lifetime risk was substantially reduced. Only 13/1,000 males and 14/1,000 females in this category will develop lung cancer. When smoking status is not adjusted for, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is approximately 96/1,000 and 43/1,000 for males and females respectively.

Our experts developed a screening decision tool to help you better understand your risk.  Learn more     Smoking, the number one cause of preventable death in the United States, causes 130,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Many smokers are now considering screening with low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scans in the hope of diagnosing the disease early. A new study that shows lung cancer risk varies widely among smokers may help individuals and their doctors decide if voluntary screening is appropriate for them.  Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center analyzed data from a large lung cancer prevention study and found that the risk of developing lung cancer can be accurately predicted based on a person’s age, sex, and smoking history. These factors accounted for an individual’s 10-year risk for developing lung cancer which ranged from a low of less than 1% to a high of 16%. The study, along with an interactive lung cancer risk prediction tool, is published in the March 19 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute .  “The risk assessment tool should help physicians and patients balance the possible risks and benefits of screening,” explained Peter Bach , M.D. of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the study’s first author. “For example, the subjects in our study who were at the low end of risk had less than a 1% chance of getting lung cancer in the next ten years. That needs to be contrasted with the 30 to 50 percent risk that a screening CT will show some lung scar or shadow that requires further evaluation or surgical biopsy, even though it will ultimately be deemed to be harmless.  “The researchers reviewed the information from a lung cancer prevention study called the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) conducted by investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. This randomized, multi-center trial looked at the effect of beta-carotene and Vitamin A supplements on lung cancer prevention in 18,314 people. The subjects included 14,254 men and women aged 50 to 69 who were considered heavy smokers - defined as having smoked at least one pack per day for 20 years and who were either current smokers or had stopped smoking within 6 years prior to enrolling in the study. The remaining 4060 participants were asbestos exposed men aged 45 to 69 who were either current smokers or former smokers who quit within 15 years of enrollment. The trial was terminated in 1996 after preliminary results indicated no benefit and possible harm from the supplements among individuals who continued to smoke cigarettes.  For the new study, the data from 18,172 subjects in the CARET trial who had a history of current or former smoking were used to create a mathematical model that predicts the likelihood that an individual will be diagnosed with lung cancer within the next ten years.For the risk prediction model, the duration of smoking, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of abstinence, and age turned out to be the main factors that determined the probability of an individual being diagnosed with lung cancer. Looking at examples from people undergoing lung cancer screening, a 51-year-old woman who smoked one pack per day for 29 years but stopped smoking 9 years earlier had a 0.8% (less than 1 in a 100) risk of getting lung cancer in the next ten years while a 68-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years and continued to smoke had a 15% (1 out of 7) chance of developing the disease in the same time period.  “Our findings suggest that accurate risk prediction may also be useful for researchers designing clinical trials of early lung cancer diagnosis,” said Colin Begg , Ph.D., chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and senior author of the study. “For example, focusing on the truly high-risk individuals may allow for more effective clinical trials of lung cancer screening and prevention.”  Mark G. Kris , M.D., chief of Thoracic Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering and one of the study’s co-authors, believes the new model will be a valuable tool in assessing risk. “Using the new model, we have a much better way to predict who is at high risk for developing lung cancer and, equally important, who is at a lower risk. With more than 90 million current and former smokers in the U.S., we need an accurate way to identify those individuals at exceptionally high risk who have the most to gain from screening.”  The study’s co-authors include Michael W. Kattan, Ph.D., Ramsey C. Tate and Lillian J. Hsieh of Memorial Sloan Kettering; Mark D. Thornquist, Ph.D. and Matt J. Barnett, M.S. of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The study was funded by the “Steps for Breath Fund” from The Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering and by a Public Health Service grant from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."
