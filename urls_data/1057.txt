Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies, but did the bookies get it right? Now the series is over, we give you the final odds and predictions - did the bookies get the winning act correct?  By Tilly Pearce 19th December 2017, 9:05 pm Updated: 19th December 2017, 9:06 pm THE X Factor 2017 has now aired the grand final and people placed their bets on who could possibly win the much-coveted contract.  As Rak-Su have been crowned champions, here are what the final odds were on this year's X Factor winner according to Sun Bets – odds were also available from Paddy Power and William Hill ...  PA:Press Association Rak-su have made it through to the live shows  Rak-Su 1/4  Boyband Rak-Su almost found themselves falling at the first hurdle when their version of Justin Timberlake's Senorita failed to impress the judges with Simon Cowell calling it to a halt with the words: "Sorry guys, it's not working for me."  Fortunately their original song I'm Feeling You had the judges singing along.  Their brave decision to perform their own material paid off and they were given four yeses and the chance to spend time with Nicole.  They have now been crowned winners of X Factor 2017.  Grace Davies 11/4  Grace Davies reduced Nicole Scherzinger to tears in her debut X Factor audition.  The 20-year-old hopeful performed her original song Roots for the four-strong judging panel but the song had a particular effect on Nicole as she struggled to hold back her emotional reaction.  Likewise Sharon Osbourne was spotted wiping away tears as she watched Warehouse assistant Grace sing.  Performing it to an audience for the very first time, Walsh labelled it a "hit" while Cowell described it as a "beautiful, beautiful song".  Grace came runner up as boyband Rak-Su were voted winners of this year's competition.  more x factor gossip 'MEAN' MUSIC MOGUL A few things you didn't know about X Factor and BGT mogul Simon Cowell CROHN'S FIGHT X Factor star lost 6st at uni from Crohn's disease & praises Dynamo's honesty looking scherious Nicole Scherzinger breaks silence after being dropped from The X Factor THE MANAGER Pop manager Louis Walsh was recently on X Factor - we take a look at his career OUTSPOKEN OSBOURNE The story of Sharon Osbourne, back on screens with the X Factor THE WINNER'S CIRCLE Here's EVERY X Factor winner so far - and who they beat WHAT A DOLL The lowdown on Nicole Scherzinger - singer axed as a judge on The X Factor... giving thanks Louis Tomlinson pays tribute to mum on eighth anniversary of X Factor try out BRACE FOR TRACE X Factor's Tracy Leanne Jefford releasing song after being dropped by SyCo WHITE WEDDING X Factor's Kevin Davy White gets engaged to long-term love Amy Carter FAT SHAME SHOCK Louis Walsh told X Factor's Lloyd Macey he had to lose weight LIFE ON THE ROAD The X Factor stars reveal the truth of what it's REALLY like on tour  When was the X Factor live final?  Traditionally the X Factor final has been in the last two weeks before Christmas.  This is so the winner can bag the coveted Christmas number one spot.  But this year the live finals were brought forwards, which meant it avoided a clash with rival show Strictly - and the winner gets more of a chance to get the Christmas number one.  The live finals began on Saturday December 2 at 7.05pm on ITV.  On Sunday December 3 at 7.20pm on ITV the last final aired, and Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies to be crowned this year's champions.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames (previously Talkback Thames) and Cowell's production company Syco TV. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the UK and simulcast on TV3 in Ireland. The "X Factor" refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality. The series consists of auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses, several weeks of live shows, semi-finals and the final. The series has a spin-off behind-the-scenes show called The Xtra Factor, which airs directly after the main show on ITV2.          Share  |         » Contact: info@nicerodds.co.uk 18+.

Ross Whent | Monday 13th November 2017 / 12:22     This weekend's theme was all about George Michael and appears Rak-Su have come out the other side in much better shape than Grace Davies at the top of the X Factor betting market .  The R&B/hip hop group are now as short as 11/10 to take home this year's crown, while Grace Davies has lengthened to 7/2.  That's in stark contrast to the very early stages of this year's live shows. Following the first weekend, Grace Davies was herself as short as 11/10 in what looked like a series that could be dominated by one stand out act, akin to Luisa Johnson in 2015. Rak-Su at that stage were 7/2.  Following revelations in the press about Grace's attitude behind the scenes, that saw her odds start to drift at the start of last week and has only been made worse by her singing a cover that George Michael sung, as opposed to one from his own back catalogue.  A big market mover this week was Kevin Davy White, whose stylish rendition of Fast Love drew copious praise from the judges, with Nicole suggesting his performance was one of the best ever on the show. That's seen his odds crash from 11/1 before this weekend's shows to a best price 6/1.  Oddschecker spokesman, George Elek: " The odds throughout this series have suggested a two horse race between Grace and Rak-Su. The praise for Kevin Davy White over the weekend and subsequent fall in his odds could mean the producers will try to create some excitement in the market this year."

Ross Casey looks at the latest X Factor odds for a multitude of X Factor betting markets.  Get a £50 free bet by visiting  Ladbrokes  today  Don't forget to get the best X Factor odds for every market in our X Factor betting centre which also includes the latest outright betting including the hotly contested outright winner market .  X Factor Odds  We are down to just three X Factor contestants after Matt Linden, The CutKelvins and Lloyd Macey were all eliminated last weekend in the semi-final. So without any further ado, let's take a look at the latest X Factor odds.  The favourites in the latest X Factor betting odds are the four piece group that is Rak-Su . The foursome performed their original song 'I’m Feeling You' which already sounds like a modern day top 10 hit record in their audition and then nailed their boot camp performance of Bruno Mars. They recorded a new song for their judges house performance and that proved a big success too. If you fancy backing them this year, you can get a best price of 1/2  using our X Factor odds comparison service! They were as big as 10/1 at one point, but they are now #1 X Factor favourites!  Our X Factor odds comparison page showed that Grace Davies was the 5/2 favourite to win the show three weeks ago. The 19 year-old Lancashire born singer wowed the judges and the watching audience with her original song 'Roots' and did not leave the top of the X Factor betting market until the emergence of Rak-Su! Her performance on stage in the live shows have not quite been up to par with the emotion of her previous attempts - because of this, she is now second favourite to win at 10/3 .  Third favourite is now Kevin Davy White after his brilliant rendition of 'Fast Love' he went up in the X Factor betting market and he was named as one of the three finalists last weekend. The talented Parisian is a best price of 7/1 to go on and be the 2017 X Factor winner - bigger odds than the 6/1 on offer last week!  Other X Factor Betting Markets  It isn't just the outright winner market that we focus on here at Easyodds. We have all the markets available on site, mobile and via our X Factor betting app .  With best odds available for gender of winner, first elimination and winning judge available we recommend you peruse those markets too to find the very best value on the net. For example, last year's winning judge Nicole Scherzinger is a much bigger price than Simon Cowell in the X Factor winning judge betting market!

Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies, but did the bookies get it right? Now the series is over, we give you the final odds and predictions - did the bookies get the winning act correct?  By Tilly Pearce 19th December 2017, 9:05 pm Updated: 19th December 2017, 9:06 pm THE X Factor 2017 has now aired the grand final and people placed their bets on who could possibly win the much-coveted contract.  As Rak-Su have been crowned champions, here are what the final odds were on this year's X Factor winner according to Sun Bets – odds were also available from Paddy Power and William Hill ...  PA:Press Association Rak-su have made it through to the live shows  Rak-Su 1/4  Boyband Rak-Su almost found themselves falling at the first hurdle when their version of Justin Timberlake's Senorita failed to impress the judges with Simon Cowell calling it to a halt with the words: "Sorry guys, it's not working for me."  Fortunately their original song I'm Feeling You had the judges singing along.  Their brave decision to perform their own material paid off and they were given four yeses and the chance to spend time with Nicole.  They have now been crowned winners of X Factor 2017.  Grace Davies 11/4  Grace Davies reduced Nicole Scherzinger to tears in her debut X Factor audition.  The 20-year-old hopeful performed her original song Roots for the four-strong judging panel but the song had a particular effect on Nicole as she struggled to hold back her emotional reaction.  Likewise Sharon Osbourne was spotted wiping away tears as she watched Warehouse assistant Grace sing.  Performing it to an audience for the very first time, Walsh labelled it a "hit" while Cowell described it as a "beautiful, beautiful song".  Grace came runner up as boyband Rak-Su were voted winners of this year's competition.  more x factor gossip 'MEAN' MUSIC MOGUL A few things you didn't know about X Factor and BGT mogul Simon Cowell CROHN'S FIGHT X Factor star lost 6st at uni from Crohn's disease & praises Dynamo's honesty looking scherious Nicole Scherzinger breaks silence after being dropped from The X Factor THE MANAGER Pop manager Louis Walsh was recently on X Factor - we take a look at his career OUTSPOKEN OSBOURNE The story of Sharon Osbourne, back on screens with the X Factor THE WINNER'S CIRCLE Here's EVERY X Factor winner so far - and who they beat WHAT A DOLL The lowdown on Nicole Scherzinger - singer axed as a judge on The X Factor... giving thanks Louis Tomlinson pays tribute to mum on eighth anniversary of X Factor try out BRACE FOR TRACE X Factor's Tracy Leanne Jefford releasing song after being dropped by SyCo WHITE WEDDING X Factor's Kevin Davy White gets engaged to long-term love Amy Carter FAT SHAME SHOCK Louis Walsh told X Factor's Lloyd Macey he had to lose weight LIFE ON THE ROAD The X Factor stars reveal the truth of what it's REALLY like on tour  When was the X Factor live final?  Traditionally the X Factor final has been in the last two weeks before Christmas.  This is so the winner can bag the coveted Christmas number one spot.  But this year the live finals were brought forwards, which meant it avoided a clash with rival show Strictly - and the winner gets more of a chance to get the Christmas number one.  The live finals began on Saturday December 2 at 7.05pm on ITV.  On Sunday December 3 at 7.20pm on ITV the last final aired, and Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies to be crowned this year's champions.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames (previously Talkback Thames) and Cowell's production company Syco TV. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the UK and simulcast on TV3 in Ireland. The "X Factor" refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality. The series consists of auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses, several weeks of live shows, semi-finals and the final. The series has a spin-off behind-the-scenes show called The Xtra Factor, which airs directly after the main show on ITV2.          Share  |         » Contact: info@nicerodds.co.uk 18+.

The R&B/hip hop group are now as short as 11/10 to take home this year's crown, while Grace Davies has lengthened to 7/2.  That's in stark contrast to the very early stages of this year's live shows. Following the first weekend, Grace Davies was herself as short as 11/10 in what looked like a series that could be dominated by one stand out act, akin to Luisa Johnson in 2015. Rak-Su at that stage were 7/2.  Following revelations in the press about Grace's attitude behind the scenes, that saw her odds start to drift at the start of last week and has only been made worse by her singing a cover that George Michael sung, as opposed to one from his own back catalogue.  A big market mover this week was Kevin Davy White, whose stylish rendition of Fast Love drew copious praise from the judges, with Nicole suggesting his performance was one of the best ever on the show. That's seen his odds crash from 11/1 before this weekend's shows to a best price 6/1.  Oddschecker spokesman, George Elek: " The odds throughout this series have suggested a two horse race between Grace and Rak-Su. The praise for Kevin Davy White over the weekend and subsequent fall in his odds could mean the producers will try to create some excitement in the market this year."

Ross Casey looks at the latest X Factor odds for a multitude of X Factor betting markets.  Get a £50 free bet by visiting  Ladbrokes  today  Don't forget to get the best X Factor odds for every market in our X Factor betting centre which also includes the latest outright betting including the hotly contested outright winner market .  X Factor Odds  We are down to just three X Factor contestants after Matt Linden, The CutKelvins and Lloyd Macey were all eliminated last weekend in the semi-final. So without any further ado, let's take a look at the latest X Factor odds.  The favourites in the latest X Factor betting odds are the four piece group that is Rak-Su . The foursome performed their original song 'I’m Feeling You' which already sounds like a modern day top 10 hit record in their audition and then nailed their boot camp performance of Bruno Mars. They recorded a new song for their judges house performance and that proved a big success too. If you fancy backing them this year, you can get a best price of 1/2  using our X Factor odds comparison service! They were as big as 10/1 at one point, but they are now #1 X Factor favourites!  Our X Factor odds comparison page showed that Grace Davies was the 5/2 favourite to win the show three weeks ago. The 19 year-old Lancashire born singer wowed the judges and the watching audience with her original song 'Roots' and did not leave the top of the X Factor betting market until the emergence of Rak-Su! Her performance on stage in the live shows have not quite been up to par with the emotion of her previous attempts - because of this, she is now second favourite to win at 10/3 .  Third favourite is now Kevin Davy White after his brilliant rendition of 'Fast Love' he went up in the X Factor betting market and he was named as one of the three finalists last weekend. The talented Parisian is a best price of 7/1 to go on and be the 2017 X Factor winner - bigger odds than the 6/1 on offer last week!  Other X Factor Betting Markets  It isn't just the outright winner market that we focus on here at Easyodds. We have all the markets available on site, mobile and via our X Factor betting app .  With best odds available for gender of winner, first elimination and winning judge available we recommend you peruse those markets too to find the very best value on the net. For example, last year's winning judge Nicole Scherzinger is a much bigger price than Simon Cowell in the X Factor winning judge betting market!
