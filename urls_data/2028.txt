What are the odds of miscarrying again? Get the facts about pregnancy after miscarriage. By Mayo Clinic Staff    Thinking about pregnancy after miscarriage? You might be feeling anxious or confused about what caused your miscarriage and when to conceive again. Here's help understanding pregnancy after miscarriage, and the steps you can take to promote a healthy pregnancy.   What causes miscarriage?    Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. Many miscarriages occur because the fetus isn't developing normally. Problems with the baby's chromosomes are responsible for about 50 percent of early pregnancy loss. Most of these chromosome problems occur by chance as the embryo divides and grows — not because of problems inherited from the parents. Sometimes a health condition, such as poorly controlled diabetes or a uterine problem, might lead to miscarriage. Often, however, the cause of miscarriage isn't known.  About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. The total number of actual miscarriages is probably higher because many women miscarry before they even know that they're pregnant.   What are the odds of another miscarriage?    Miscarriage is usually a one-time occurrence. Most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies after miscarriage. A small number of women — 1 percent — will have two or more miscarriages.  The predicted risk of miscarriage in a future pregnancy remains about 14 percent after one miscarriage. After two miscarriages the risk of another miscarriage increases to about 26 percent, and after three miscarriages the risk of another miscarriage is about 28 percent.   Are special tests recommended before attempting pregnancy after miscarriage?    If you experience two or more consecutive miscarriages, talk with your health care provider about whether further testing is needed to identify any underlying causes before attempting to get pregnant again. For example:   Blood tests. A sample of your blood is evaluated to help detect problems with hormones or your immune system.  Chromosomal tests. You and your partner might both have your blood tested to determine if your chromosomes are a factor. Tissue from the miscarriage — if it's available — also might be tested.   Procedures can be done to detect uterine problems. For example:   Ultrasound. This imaging method uses high-frequency sound waves to produce precise images of structures within the body. Your health care provider places the ultrasound device (transducer) over your abdomen or places it inside your vagina to obtain images of your uterus. An ultrasound might identify uterine problems such as fibroids within the uterine cavity.  Hysteroscopy. Your health care provider inserts a thin, lighted instrument called a hysteroscope through your cervix into your uterus to diagnose and treat identified intrauterine problems.  Hysterosalpingography. Your health care provider inserts a catheter inside your cervix, which releases a liquid contrast material into your uterus. The dye traces the shape of your uterine cavity and fallopian tubes and makes them visible on X-ray images. This procedure provides information about the internal contours of the uterus and any obstructions in the fallopian tubes.  Sonohysterogram. This ultrasound scan is done after fluid is injected into your uterus though your vagina and cervix. This procedure provides information about the internal contours of the uterus, the outer surface of the uterus and any obstructions in the fallopian tubes.   If the cause of your miscarriages can't be identified, don't lose hope. Most women who experience repeated miscarriages are likely to eventually have healthy pregnancies.

Ultrasound scans  Ultrasound scans in pregnancy may be routine or they may be offered because of pain or bleeding or because of problems in a previous pregnancy.  There are two ways of doing an ultrasound scan.  In early pregnancy, especially before 11 weeks, it is usual to have a trans-vaginal (internal) scan , where a probe is placed in the vagina.  This gives the clearest and most accurate picture in early pregnancy.  It may also be offered after 11 or 12 weeks if a trans-abdominal scan doesn’t give a clear enough picture.  From 11 or 12 weeks, including at the routine booking-in scan, it is more common  to have a trans-abdominal scan .  The person doing the scan spreads a special gel on your lower abdomen (below your belly button and above the line of pubic hair).  He or she then moves the scanner over the gel, sometimes pressing down, until the uterus (womb) and pregnancy can be seen.  What if I don’t want an internal scan?  If you don’t want a trans-vaginal scan, you can ask for a trans-abdominal scan. That may give some information about your pregnancy, but it is less clear than an internal scan and that could possibly delay diagnosis.  Can ultrasound scans harm the baby?  There is no evidence that having a vaginal or an abdominal scan will cause a miscarriage or harm your baby. If you bleed after a vaginal scan, it will most likely be because there was already blood pooled higher in the vagina and the probe dislodged it.  When can I have an ultrasound scan? When can you see the baby’s heartbeat?  An ultrasound scan may be able to detect a pregnancy and a heartbeat in a normal pregnancy at around 6 weeks, but this varies a great deal and isn’t usually advised.  All too often, a scan at 6 weeks shows very little or nothing, even in a perfectly developing pregnancy, whereas waiting a week or 10 days will make the findings much clearer.  Routine scans  Most pregnant women are referred for their first routine (or booking) ultrasound scan somewhere between 11 and 14 weeks of pregnancy.  The purpose of the scan is:   to confirm that there is a heartbeat  to assess the baby’s size and growth  to estimate the delivery date and  to check whether there is one baby, or twins or more.   Some women may be offered a nuchal scan between 11 and 14 weeks. The purpose of this scan is to try to detect some chromosome abnormalities, such as Downs syndrome.  Many hospitals also offer a further anomaly scan at 20 weeks, making a more detailed check of the baby’s development.  You can find out more about routine, nuchal and anomaly scans at the website of the charity ARC – Antenatal Results and Choices  Sadly…  Sadly, sometimes these scans show that the baby has died, possibly some weeks earlier and often without any signs or symptoms such as bleeding or pain. This is often called a “missed”, “silent” or “delayed” miscarriage. This can come as a considerable shock and it may take time before you can take this information in.  You may also have to make some difficult decisions about how to manage the miscarriage process. You can read more about this here.  Early scans  You may be referred for an early scan because of vaginal bleeding or spotting, or possibly because you have had problems in a previous pregnancy.  The best time to have a scan is from about 7 weeks’ gestation when it should be possible to see the baby’s heartbeat in a normal pregnancy . But it can be hard to detect a heartbeat in early pregnancy and in those cases it can be hard to know whether the baby has died or not developed at all, or whether it is simply smaller than expected but still developing.  For that reason, you may be asked to return for another scan a week or so later.  At that time, the person doing the scan will be looking for a clear difference in the size of the pregnancy sac and for a developing baby and a heartbeat.  Sometimes, it can take several scans before you know for sure what is happening.  It can be very stressful dealing with this uncertainty – some women describe it as being “in limbo”.  You may need to find some support for yourself if this happens to you.  There’s a heartbeat, but I’m still bleeding…  If the scan does pick up a heartbeat and the baby appears to be the right size according to your dates, this can be very reassuring, even if you are still bleeding.  Research amongst women with a history of recurrent miscarriage has shown that those who saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks of pregnancy had a 78% chance of the pregnancy continuing.  It also showed that seeing a heartbeat at 8 weeks increased the chance of a continuing pregnancy to 98% and at 10 weeks that went up to 99.4%.  The numbers may be even more positive for women without previous miscarriages.  So things could still go wrong and sadly sometimes do, but as long as there is a heartbeat, the risk of miscarriage decreases as the weeks go by.  Other investigations  In some cases, if there is no sign of a pregnancy in the uterus, you may be given a blood test and possibly asked to return two days later for a repeat test.  These blood tests measure the level of the pregnancy hormone ßhCG. In a normally developing pregnancy the hormone levels double about every 48 hours and if the pattern is different, this can help to identify what is happening to the pregnancy.  If there is no sign of a pregnancy in the uterus and you have symptoms that suggest ectopic pregnancy, you are more likely to have both a blood test and an investigation called a laparoscopy, which is done under general anaesthetic. You can read more about this in our leaflet Ectopic pregnancy .  Ultrasound scan results – and what they mean  The ultrasound scan may show:   A viable ongoing pregnancy.  There is a heartbeat (or heartbeats if it’s a twin or multiple pregnancy) and the pregnancy is the “right size for dates” – that is, the size that would be expected based on the first day of your last period.  Those are positive signs, but if you continue to bleed, you may need a further scan in a week or two to check what’s happening.    An ongoing pregnancy that suggests a problem.  The pregnancy may be much smaller than it should be according to dates or the heartbeat might be particularly slow or faint.  Perhaps there is something that suggests a problem with the baby’s development. With a twin or multiple pregnancy, the scan may show that one (or more) baby has a heartbeat and one (or more) doesn’t.  You may be asked to come back for another scan, possibly in a week or two when things should be clearer.    A pregnancy of unknown location (PUL).  The pregnancy is not visible and it’s not clear what is happening.  You may be asked to come back for another scan, possibly in a week or two when things should be clearer.  Or if the doctor thinks you might have an ectopic pregnancy, you will have blood tests and/or a laparoscopy (keyhole surgery to look inside the abdomen).    A complete miscarriage.  The pregnancy has miscarried.  There may still be a small amount of pregnancy tissue or blood in the uterus.    A non-viable pregnancy. This means a pregnancy that hasn’t survived but hasn’t yet miscarried.  You may hear this described in one of the following ways:      Missed miscarriage (also called silent or delayed miscarriage or early embryonic demise) This is where the baby has died or failed to develop but your body has not miscarried him or her. The scan picture shows a pregnancy sac with a baby (or fetus or embryo) inside, but there is no heartbeat and the pregnancy looks smaller than it should be at this stage.  You may have had little or no sign that anything was wrong and you may still feel pregnant.        Blighted ovum or anembryonic pregnancy (which means a pregnancy without an embryo). This is a rather old-fashioned way of describing a missed miscarriage (see above). The scan picture usually shows an empty pregnancy sac.        Incomplete miscarriage The process of miscarriage has started but there is still pregnancy tissue in the uterus (womb) and you may still have pain and heavy bleeding.     In all of these situations, the pregnancy will fully miscarry with time, but there are several ways of managing the process. You may be offered a choice, or the hospital might make a recommendation. In most cases, you should be able to have time to think about what you can best cope with. You can read more here .  The ultrasound scan might show   An ectopic pregnancy . This means a pregnancy that is developing outside the uterus (Ectopic means “out of place”). Ectopic pregnancies usually develop in one of the Fallopian tubes, but they can develop elsewhere inside the abdomen.    A molar pregnancy . This is a pregnancy where the baby can’t develop but the cells of the placenta grow very quickly. It can’t always be diagnosed on scan so you might find out only after the miscarriage.

How common is recurrent miscarriage?  What causes recurrent miscarriage?  What tests and treatment can I have?  What are my chances of having a healthy baby?  Where can I get support?    What is recurrent miscarriage? If you have three or more miscarriages in a row, doctors call it recurrent miscarriage. If you have experienced recurrent miscarriage, your GP or midwife will refer you to a gynaecologist. Your gynaecologist will try to identify the reason for your losses.  Having miscarriage after miscarriage may leave you feeling utterly drained of hope. At times, it may be hard to keep trusting in the future.  If you can, try to draw comfort from the fact that most women who experience recurrent losses do go on to have a baby. This is especially the case if tests can find no reason for the losses (RCOG 2012, Kaandorp et al 2014) . Six out of 10 women who have had three miscarriages will go on to have a baby in their next pregnancy (RCOG 2012) . How common is recurrent miscarriage? About one woman in 100 experiences recurrent miscarriage. Frustratingly, it's often unclear why it keeps happening to some women. Doctors can't find a reason in about half the cases of recurrent miscarriage (Duckitt and Qureshi 2011, Whitley et al 2013) .  But some problems that cause some women to miscarry again and again can be identified. What causes recurrent miscarriage? When you have endured recurrent miscarriage, the one question you'll probably want answered is: "Why is this happening?" Even if no reason is found for the miscarriages, it may still mean there's the chance of a successful pregnancy happening next time.  Some health conditions are known to lead to miscarriage. Others have been linked to it, but it's not fully understood how or why they may play a part. Experts are continually finding out more about what causes recurrent miscarriage.  Conditions that are known to lead to recurrent miscarriage are often uncommon. They include:    A problem that makes your blood clot when it shouldn't. This is called antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as sticky blood syndrome or Hughes syndrome (RCOG 2012) . APS has been found in between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of recurrent miscarriages (Duckitt and Qureshi 2011, Newson 2013, RCOG 2011) .  An inherited blood-clotting disorder, called thrombophilia. It's similar to APS, but is something you are born with rather than acquire. Thrombophilia means that your blood may be more likely to clot than normal (Newson 2013) . This could cause recurrent miscarriage (RCOG 2012) .  Genetic problems. You or your partner may have an abnormality on one of your chromosomes, which doesn't cause a problem until it is passed on to your baby. Recurrent miscarriage is thought to be linked to chromosomal abnormality for between two per cent and five per cent of couples (Newson 2013, RCOG 2011, 2012) .  Problems with your womb (uterus) or cervix. You may have a womb that has an abnormal shape (Newson 2013) , or a weak cervix (Newson 2013) .  Bacterial vaginosis, a vaginal infection, increases the risk of late miscarriage and premature birth (Newson 2013) . Doctors are still finding out about how and why infections like this may cause recurrent miscarriage (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  A problem with your hormones. Some conditions, such as polycystic ovaries have been linked to recurrent miscarriage (Newson 2013, RCOG 2011) . But, as yet, it's not fully understood why they are linked and how well treatments work (RCOG 2011) .  There are also some lifestyle factors that can affect the risk of miscarriage. Learn more on Tommy's website .  It may simply be that your age is having an effect. The older you are, the more likely you are to experience miscarriage (Newson 2013) . The age of your baby's father may also increase the risk of miscarriage (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  And added to this, it's a sad fact that the risk of a further miscarriage does increase slightly with each miscarriage (RCOG 2011) .  From about the age of 35, the number of your eggs and their quality starts to decline more quickly (RCOG 2011, Newson 2013) . This can make the genetic material in your eggs more likely to go wrong during fertilisation. A chromosomal abnormality in your baby is therefore more likely to happen and this, in turn, increases the likelihood of miscarriage (RCOG 2011) .  Despite all these possible causes, it often turns out that a reason for recurrent miscarriage cannot be found (RCOG 2011) . This is called unexplained recurrent miscarriage. As more is discovered about what causes recurrent miscarriage, the number of unexplained cases may fall. What tests and treatment can I have? If you have had three or more miscarriages in a row, your GP should refer you to a gynaecologist. Your gynaecologist may be part of a recurrent miscarriage clinic, such as Tommy's National Miscarriage Research Centre . She will try to find out why you keep having miscarriages. You should be offered the following:   Tests   You can have blood tests to check for APS, or sticky blood syndrome (Newson 2013) . Tests will look for antibodies that go with the condition (RCOG 2011) . Antibodies are chemicals that our bodies produce to fight infection. It takes two tests, at least six weeks apart, to find out for sure whether you have APS (Newson 2013) .  If you do have APS, with the right care from your doctor, you have a good chance of a successful pregnancy. Next time you're pregnant, your doctor will offer you blood-thinning medicines such as aspirin and heparin (Empson et al 2005) to treat APS.  You and your partner can have blood tests to check for chromosomal abnormalities. This is called karyotyping (Newson 2013) . If an abnormality is discovered, you and your partner should be referred to a clinical genetics specialist and for genetic counselling.  A counsellor can explain what the abnormality is and talk you through your chances of having a healthy pregnancy.  Sometimes, though, tests don't provide answers (RCOG 2011,2012) . If your doctor can't find a reason for your miscarriages you could see it as a reason for better luck next time, if you want to keep trying . Or you may be very upset that there is no explanation for your loss, and frustrated that there isn't a fix that can be tried.  Your doctor may offer more tests if you have another miscarriage. You may consent to tests of the pregnancy tissues that are lost or to a post mortem of your baby, if you had a late miscarriage (RCOG 2011, RCOG 2012) . These tests can look for chromosome problems.  Tissues from the placenta may also be tested for signs of a problem. If an abnormality is discovered then there is a better chance of you having a successful pregnancy next time. That's because the abnormality is likely to be a one-off.   Ultrasound scans   Your doctor should offer an ultrasound scan to check your womb. A scan may show an abnormality that's been making pregnancy difficult (Jaslow and Kutteh 2013, Newson 2013, RCOG 2011) . Depending on the abnormality, it may still be possible for you to have a successful pregnancy. For example, some abnormalities can be put right by surgery (Kowalik etal 2011, Sugiura-Ogasawara et al 2013) .  If you have a suspected weak or short cervix , you may be offered extra scans in your next pregnancy (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  It can be hard for your doctor to find out if you have weak cervix when you are not pregnant. Your doctor may suspect this is the case if, in a previous pregnancy, your waters broke early, or if your cervix opened painlessly (RCOG 2012) .  During your next pregnancy, it may be possible to have a minor operation to put a stitch in your cervix. This can help to stop you miscarrying again. There are pros and cons to this procedure, which your doctor will explain to you (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  Both abnormalities of the womb and cervical weakness are rare conditions (RCOG 2011) . What are my chances of having a healthy baby? If your miscarriages are unexplained then you have a good chance of having a successful pregnancy in the future (Kaandorp et al 2014) . You'll be looked after very carefully and given extra support and scans from the beginning of your pregnancy.  A dedicated team will look after you in an early pregnancy unit (EPU), if there's one near you. This close care and support in itself can increase your chances of a successful pregnancy (RCOG 2011, Whitley et al 2013) . About three quarters of women who have unexplained recurrent losses have a healthy baby eventually with the right support and care (Duckitt and Qureshi 2011, RCOG 2011, 2012) .  If you or your partner has a chromosome problem that's causing the miscarriages, it is hard to say what your chances of having a healthy baby are if you just keep trying. Some problems are not passed on every time you conceive. Every couple is different, so you'll be referred to a doctor who specialises in genetic disorders for counselling (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  Some, but not all of the conditions that cause recurrent miscarriage are treatable (Newson 2013) . Your gynaecologist is the best person to ask about your chances of success. She won't be able to tell you for sure - nobody can. But she'll be able to take your medical history, your age, and test results into account when discussing your chances with you.  It can be very hard if you're feeling so knocked back by all your losses that you're not sure if you can face losing another baby. Having lots of support can help. Talk to close friends, family and your doctor about how you feel.  If you feel you want to try again for a baby, you may want to read our article about pregnancy after a miscarriage . Where can I get support? You can read our article on coping with miscarriage .  You'll also find plenty of support in the BabyCentre community from other women who've had the same experiences as you.  The charity, The Miscarriage Association , has further information.  If you do get pregnant again, you'll have extra support and appointments. This may be offered through
a clinic dedicated to recurrent and late miscarriage (RCOG 2012) , or an early pregnancy unit (EPU). Find out if there is an EPU in your area through the Early Pregnancy Information Centre . Each early pregnancy unit is run by a team of doctors, nurses, sonographers and support staff. They specialise in helping with problems in early pregnancy.

A BabyCentre Member  08/04/18    I'm currently going through my third miscarriage in 7 months. I already have three children (two from my previous marriage) , my partner and I desperately want a second child together. I should be 9 weeks today but we found out at an early scan two days ago that there was no heat beat. We have been hit by a double blow this time as we found out that we would have had twins. I'm 36 and concerned that my age is a factor and will continue to be as time passes by. Each loss gets harder to deal with, we are utterly heartbroken and it's hard in the here and now to keep hope that we will be able to one again experience the joy of another child.   Report this           A BabyCentre Member  05/02/18    Hello.
I lost another baby. Yes, another, my 8th. Am I guilty that I don't want to give up?   Report this           A BabyCentre Member  01/02/18    I have now had another MC, it happened last night. I also lost one in October I didn't know I had MC until I went for my 12 week scan, which was quite a shock. With this pregnancy I had some light bleeding at 5 weeks, went for a scan no heart beat but was told to come back the next week as it's normal for them not to see a heartbeat at 5 weeks.
I offered to take part in Tommy Miscarriage research at the EPU, so they scanned me again at 6 weeks, the heartbeat was there. I felt reassured! Next scan was in 2 weeks when I should of been 8 weeks but I had bleeding the day before so went to the EPU, I had miscarried.
I am 38, have has 4 babies with no problems, natural births no complications. This would of been my first child with my 2nd husband so I am left thinking is there something that is not compatible with me and him or is it because of my age.I would of thought the midwife would of seen me earlier due to the first MC but no they don't!!   Report this           A BabyCentre Member  21/01/18    Hi all, I've had 5 miscarriages (2 before I had my son who is now 21 months) and 2 just recently. I was told 2 weeks ago at my scan that my babies heart had stopped beating. I was 9 weeks along. All of them have been different and no one can explain why I had them. I carried my son over his due date and he was a healthy 9lb 14oz baby. I wanted to say to those of you who have experienced loss or those of you who are going through it, not to give up hope. My pregnancy with my son was a normal pregnancy with no complications and i had a natural birth which proves that every pregnancy is different. To the lady who posted on 21st Dec I know how you feel, its heart breaking and you feel so alone and that no one else understands. Have you talked to your doctor to see if they can do some tests? Maybe this could give you a bit of reassurance? Please try to stay positive , the next pregnancy could be the one!   Report this          A BabyCentre Member  21/12/17    Hello ladies, I wanted advise as im I dont feel happy anymore to live. Ive had 3 miscarrisges within two years and in my third year I had an ectopic pregnancy at middle of this year. Suprisingly I got pregnant just after 4 months after a succesful surgery to remove my right tube prior to the ectopic pregnancy. I had some slight spots just almost in my 11th week and an ultra scan showed my baby wasn't breathing anymore. Im soo upset and devastated right now. I feel like dying as this will be my 5th miscarriage. Is there hope...has someone gone through what im going through now. All Ive got left now is to look up to God and leave everything to him.

Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks. (In medical articles, you may see the term "spontaneous abortion" used in place of miscarriage.) About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, and more than 80 percent of these losses happen before 12 weeks. This doesn't include situations in which you lose a fertilized egg before a pregnancy becomes established. Studies have found that 30 to 50 percent of fertilized eggs are lost before or during the process of implantation – often so early that a woman goes on to get her period at about the expected time.  Spotting the signs of a miscarriage If you have these signs of miscarriage, call your doctor or midwife right away so she can determine whether you have a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately: Bleeding or spotting.  Vaginal spotting or bleeding is usually the first sign of miscarriage. Keep in mind, though, that up to 1 in 4 pregnant women have some bleeding or spotting (finding spots of blood on your underpants or toilet tissue) in early pregnancy, and most of these pregnancies don't end in miscarriage. Abdominal pain. Abdominal pain usually begins after you first have some bleeding. It may feel crampy or persistent, mild or sharp, or may feel more like low back pain or pelvic pressure. When should I call my doctor with a pregnancy concern? There are some symptoms you should not ignore; call your doctor if you're pregnant and experiencing these symptoms. See all videos If you have both bleeding and pain, the chances of your pregnancy continuing are much lower. It's very important to be aware that vaginal bleeding, spotting, or pain in early pregnancy can also signal an ectopic or a molar pregnancy . Also, if your blood is Rh-negative , you may need a shot of Rh immune globulin within two or three days after you first notice bleeding, unless the baby's father is Rh-negative as well. Some miscarriages are first suspected during a routine prenatal visit, when the doctor or midwife can't hear the baby's heartbeat or notices that your uterus isn't growing as it should be. (Often the embryo or fetus stops developing a few weeks before you have symptoms like bleeding or cramping.) If your practitioner suspects that you've had a miscarriage, she'll order an ultrasound to see what's going on in your uterus. She may also do a blood test.  What causes a miscarriage Between 50 and 70 percent of first-trimester miscarriages are thought to be random events caused by chromosomal abnormalities in the fertilized egg. Most often, this means that the egg or sperm had the wrong number of chromosomes , and as a result, the fertilized egg can't develop normally. Sometimes a miscarriage is caused by problems that occur during the delicate process of early development. This would include an egg that doesn't implant properly in the uterus or an embryo with structural defects that prevent it from developing. Since most healthcare practitioners won't do a full-scale workup of a healthy woman after a single miscarriage, it's usually impossible to tell why the pregnancy was lost. And even when a detailed evaluation is performed – after you've had two or three consecutive miscarriages, for instance – the cause still remains unknown half the time. When the fertilized egg has chromosomal problems, you may end up with what's sometimes called a blighted ovum (now usually referred to in medical circles as an early pregnancy failure). In this case, the fertilized egg implants in the uterus and the placenta and gestational sac begin to develop, but the resulting embryo either stops developing very early or doesn't form at all. Because the placenta begins to secrete hormones, you'll get a positive pregnancy test and may have early pregnancy symptoms, but an ultrasound will show an empty gestational sac. In other cases, the embryo does develop for a little while but has abnormalities that make survival impossible, and development stops before the heart starts beating. If your baby has a normal heartbeat – usually first visible on ultrasound at around 6 weeks – and you have no symptoms like bleeding or cramping, your odds of having a miscarriage drop significantly and continue to decrease with each passing week.  What puts you at a higher risk for miscarriage Though any woman can miscarry, some are more likely to miscarry than others. Here are some risk factors: Age: Older women are more likely to conceive a baby with a chromosomal abnormality and to miscarry as a result. In fact, 40-year-olds are about twice as likely to miscarry as 20-year-olds. Your risk of miscarriage also rises with each child you bear. A history of miscarriages: Women who have had two or more miscarriages in a row are more likely than other women to miscarry again. Chronic diseases or disorders: Poorly controlled diabetes and certain inherited blood clotting disorders, autoimmune disorders (such as antiphospholipid syndrome or lupus ), and hormonal disorders (such as polycystic ovary syndrome) are some of the conditions that could increase the risk of miscarriage. Uterine or cervical problems: Having certain congenital uterine abnormalities, severe uterine adhesions (bands of scar tissue), or a weak or abnormally short cervix (known as cervical insufficiency) up the odds for a miscarriage. The link between uterine fibroids (a common, benign growth) and miscarriage is controversial, but most fibroids don't cause problems. A history of birth defects or genetic problems: If you, your partner, or family members have a genetic abnormality, have had one identified in a previous pregnancy, or have given birth to a child with a birth defect, you're at higher risk for miscarriage. Infections: Research has shown a somewhat higher risk for miscarriage if you have listeria , mumps, rubella , measles, cytomegalovirus , parvovirus, gonorrhea , HIV , and certain other infections. Smoking, drinking, and using drugs: Smoking, drinking alcohol , and using drugs like cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) during pregnancy can all increase your risk for miscarriage. Some studies show an association between high levels of caffeine consumption and an increased risk of miscarriage. Medications: Some medications have been linked to increased risk of miscarriage, so it's important to ask your caregiver about the safety of any medications you're taking, even while you're trying to conceive. This goes for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin . Environmental toxins: Environmental factors that might increase your risk include lead; arsenic; some chemicals, like formaldehyde, benzene, and ethylene oxide; and large doses of radiation or anesthetic gases. Paternal factors: Little is known about how the father's condition contributes to a couple's risk for miscarriage, though the risk does rise with the father's age. Researchers are studying the extent to which sperm could be damaged by environmental toxins but still manage to fertilize an egg. Some studies have found a greater risk of miscarriage when the father has been exposed to mercury, lead, and some industrial chemicals and pesticides. Obesity: Some studies show a link between obesity and miscarriage. Diagnostic procedures: There's a small increased risk of miscarriage after chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis , which may be performed for diagnostic genetic testing. Your risk of miscarriage is also higher if you get pregnant within three months after giving birth.  What to do if you think you might be having a miscarriage Call your doctor or midwife immediately if you ever notice unusual symptoms such as bleeding or cramping during pregnancy. Your practitioner will examine you to see if the bleeding is coming from your cervix and check your uterus. She may also do a blood test to check for the pregnancy hormone hCG and repeat it in two to three days to see if your levels are rising as they should be. If you're having bleeding or cramping and your practitioner has even the slightest suspicion that you have an ectopic pregnancy , you'll have an ultrasound right away. If there's no sign of a problem but you continue to spot, you'll have another ultrasound at about 7 weeks. At this point, if the sonographer sees an embryo with a normal heartbeat, you have a viable pregnancy and your risk of miscarrying is now much lower, but you'll need to have another ultrasound later if you continue to bleed. If the sonographer determines that the embryo is the appropriate size but there's no heartbeat, it means the embryo didn't survive. If the sac or the embryo is smaller than expected, the absence of a heartbeat might just mean that your dates are off and you're not as far along as you thought. Depending on the circumstances, you may need a repeat ultrasound within one to two weeks and some blood tests before your caregiver can make a final diagnosis. If you're in your second trimester and an ultrasound shows your cervix is shortening or opening , your doctor may decide to perform a procedure called cerclage, in which she stitches your cervix closed in an attempt to prevent miscarriage or premature delivery . (This is assuming your baby appears normal on the ultrasound and you have no signs of an intrauterine infection.) Cerclage isn't without risk, and not everyone agrees on what makes you a good candidate for it. If you're showing signs of a possible miscarriage, your doctor or midwife may prescribe bedrest in hopes of reducing your chances of miscarrying – but there's no evidence that bedrest will help. She may also suggest that you not have sex while you're having bleeding or cramping. Sex doesn't cause miscarriage, but it's a good idea to abstain if you're having these symptoms. You may have light bleeding and cramping for a few weeks. You can wear sanitary pads but no tampons during this time and take acetaminophen for the pain. If you are miscarrying, the bleeding and cramping will likely get worse shortly before you pass the "products of conception" – that is, the placenta and the embryonic or fetal tissue, which will look grayish and may include blood clots. If you can, save this tissue in a clean container. Your caregiver may want to examine it or send it to a lab for testing to try to find out why you miscarried. In any case, she'll want to see you again at this point, so call her to let her know what's happened.  What happens if you don't pass the tissue There are different ways of handling this, and it's a good idea to discuss the pros and cons of each with your caregiver. If there's no threat to your health, you may choose to wait and let the tissue pass on its own. (More than half of women spontaneously miscarry within a week of finding out that the pregnancy is no longer viable.) Or you may decide to wait a certain amount of time to see what happens before having a procedure to remove the tissue. In some cases, you can use medication to speed up the process, although there may be side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you choose to wait or take medication to try to speed it up, there's a chance you'll end up needing to have the tissue surgically removed anyway. On the other hand, if you find that it's too emotionally trying or physically painful to wait for the tissue to pass, you may decide to just have it removed. This is done by suction curettage or dilation and curettage (D&C). You'll definitely need to have the tissue removed right away if you have any problems that make it unsafe to wait, such as significant bleeding or signs of infection. And your practitioner may recommend the procedure if this is your second or third miscarriage in a row, so the tissue can be tested for a genetic cause.  Suction curettage and traditional D&C The procedure doesn't usually require an overnight stay unless you have complications. As with any surgery, you'll need to arrive with an empty stomach – no food or drink since the night before. Most obstetricians prefer to use suction curettage (or vacuum aspiration) because it's thought to be slightly quicker and safer than a traditional D&C, though some will use a combination of the two. For either procedure, the doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina, clean your cervix and vagina with an antiseptic solution, and dilate your cervix with narrow metal rods (unless your cervix is already dilated from having passed some tissue). In most cases, you'll be given sedation through an IV and a local anesthetic to numb your cervix. For suction curettage, the doctor will pass a hollow plastic tube through your cervix and suction out the tissue from your uterus. For a traditional D&C, she'll use a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette to gently scrape the tissue from the walls of your uterus. The whole thing may take about 15 to 20 minutes, though the tissue removal itself takes less than ten minutes. Finally, if your blood is Rh-negative , you'll receive a shot of Rh immune globulin unless the baby's father is Rh-negative, too.  What happens after a miscarriage Whether you pass the tissue on your own or have it removed, you'll have mild menstrual-like cramps afterward for up to a day or so and light bleeding for a week or two. Use pads instead of tampons and take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the cramps. Avoid sex, swimming, douching, and using vaginal medications for at least a couple of weeks and until your bleeding has stopped. If you begin to bleed heavily (soaking a sanitary pad in an hour), have any signs of infection (such as fever, achiness, or foul-smelling vaginal discharge), or feel excessive pain, call your practitioner immediately or go to the emergency room. If your bleeding is heavy and you begin to feel weak, dizzy, or lightheaded, you may be going into shock. In this case, call 911 right away – don't wait to hear from your caregiver, and don't drive yourself to the ER.  The chance of having another miscarriage It's understandable to be worried about the possibility of another miscarriage, but fertility experts don't consider a single early pregnancy loss to be a sign that there's anything wrong with you or your partner. Some practitioners will order special blood and genetic tests to try to find out what's going on after two miscarriages in a row, particularly if you're 35 or older or you have certain medical conditions. Others will wait until you've had three consecutive losses. In certain situations, such as if you had a second-trimester miscarriage or an early-third-trimester premature birth from a weakened cervix, you might be referred to a high-risk specialist after a single loss so your pregnancy can be carefully managed.  Conceiving again after a miscarriage You may have to wait a bit. Whether you miscarry spontaneously, with the help of medication, or have the tissue removed, you'll generally get your period again in four to six weeks. Some practitioners say you can start trying to conceive again after this period, but others recommend that you wait until you've been through another menstrual cycle so that you have more time to recover physically and emotionally. (You'll need to use birth control to prevent conception during this time, because you may ovulate as early as two weeks after you miscarry.)  How to cope after a miscarriage Though you may be physically ready to get pregnant again, you may not feel ready emotionally. Some women cope best by turning their attention toward trying for a new pregnancy as soon as possible. Others find that months or more go by before they're ready to try to conceive again. Take the time to examine your feelings, and do what feels right for you and your partner. For more information see our article on coping with pregnancy loss . You may find help in a support group (your caregiver can refer you to one) or in our Community's miscarriage support discussions . If you're feeling overwhelmed by your sadness, call your caregiver. She can put you in touch with a therapist who can help. If you're wondering how to explain a pregnancy loss to your child, read about how to talk to your preschooler about pregnancy loss .

And that's highly unlikely to happen again. It could, but it's most likely you'll be able to carry another child to term. Unless, the father of the other 3 isn't the father of the new one you're TTC. In that case, there could be another problem. But really, you should keep trying and you'll probably do great! GL.    --  Mama to two sweet little bear cubs.

He did tell me the whole 80% thing as well.  Also- if you look at other posts that I did I was told of other tests you can have done to beater help your changes of finding out why you might MC.  Basic routine blood tests so I am going to do them.  I just do not think I can handle another MC  (miscarriage) but I know that I cannot "not" try again.  Good Luck!    --  - Michelle (wife to Jeff) mom to Samantha 11/17/05 and Madison 4/7/10 (after 2 MC's & 2 yrs of TTC)             Reply            Report this comment        1                     kim in Iowa    Posted 01/31/2009      I have some questions what does A/F mean and dpo mean?  The post I read have some abbreviations, I do not know what they mean??

04/15/2017  I'm not sure of the stats but after my first Mmc my dr told me "the odds of it happening again are so low. I rarely see a lady miscarriage twice in a row, unless there is other health issues going on" (at the time I had 3 children and no known health issues) that made me optimistic but unfortunately I had a second Mmc right after. We went on to have testing and found out what was causing them. Anyway- according to my dr your odds are good if you have no health issues!      What caused it?

I had a blighted ovum in January and found out at the 8 week ultrasound. Waited 2 more weeks and nothing had changed so went ahead with D and C. I found out I'm pregnant again with no period on March 15th. Had my first ultrasound on April 11th and saw a sac with yolk sac with "possible" fetal pole. No hb yet. My doctor doesn't seem worried at all and I'm wondering how 4 weeks after a positive I'm dating 6 weeks. Hoping it's not another mmc. If anyone knows if there is a way to know why it happens please tell!

04/15/2017  What caused it?      Mine were most likely caused because I have a chromosome abnormality. It doesn't effect me but can be passed to future babies. I also have MTHFR. Which can cause clotting issues and makes my body not processs folic acid the way it should.

I have seen a lot of women posting statistics which are all very accurate; however, someone out there represents a number in those stats and I for one am one of those. I miscarried twice in a row with absolutely no medical reasonings as to why. I am considered very healthy and unless there is something deeper going on that my doctor has yet to discover then I was just one of the unfortunate few that went thru this twice. As a matter of fact they were 3 months apart. I fell pregnant after both, the second one ending me up here at 9 weeks tomorrow (let me add this is the furthest mine have ever gotten). I say this to you because sometimes our body's know when something is wrong before we do and they do exactly what they are designed to do and expel most likely a fetus that was never sustainable for life. (I'm a nurse as well, so please don't take my words as being thoughtless and harsh). My point is none of us know what tomorrow holds and that's the scary part, but try to commemorate this pregnancy as your second chance at being a mama (even though you'll always be one- your first precious baby just has a set of angel wings). Your breasts are sore- yay! Hold on to that symptom because that's something! stay positive and try not to stress yourself out.. you and your baby need a sense of peace during this time. So when you find yourself getting stressed, find something to take your mind off it! My point is don't stress about the chances, instead focus on the now and find peace for you and that baby of yours!

So it looks like another mmc. I have one child and before her I had 2 Mc early before 6 weeks. You can never tell because I still have sore boobs and still feel very pregnant unfortunately that's why mmc are so hard to detect.

Right now, I'm awaiting my second mmc at 9 weeks or so as the heartbeat had stopped either Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. We had saw and heard it last Thursday and Friday. I have no living children. What are my chances of actually being successful third try? I know there's no medical advice anyone can give, but I just need to hear from other women who have had a similar experience. I don't get why I've had two losses in 7 months all at 9 weeks. So heartbreaking.  Just trying to make sense of this,           See all comments from original poster (5)  Hide all comments from original poster (5)      Load more            Comment            Report this post        7          Comments (19)        / 2                   SnnysAngl03    Posted 07/19/2014      Im so sorry...

I've had 3 MC's now and I'm down to a 60% chance. My ob told me the same "you have every reason to believe" statement that Natasha said, but when asked for statistics, my re is pretty open and told me.  That being said, a 75% chance is pretty dang good. I wouldn't worry yet. Good luck!

I figured 'ok, first time, it happens' now, the second time in a row...What's wrong?! This time around, the doctor did mention the pregnancy being a mono-mono twin pregnancy and only one baby made it to having a heartbeat and the other was in the process of being reabsorbed. I guess, that's my way of thinking this pregnancy was unusual. So, I may have a better chance next time if it's just one baby. Just hopeful thinking and rationalizing. Thanks again.

This time, I haven't had any hormone testing. I asked my doctor about it and she said with me making it this far she does not believe there is a hormone imbalance. She said she would've figured I would have spotted prior if it were hormones. She said I can get testing if I want, so when I get home, that's what I'll request. She also told me progesterone has to do with the luteal phase and such and does not occur as often as people may think. I don't know. My luteal phase is normally 12 days, so I've never had any issues. Each time we tried to get pregnant, we did.

When I had the D&C; done, I was alreay producing colostrum.  I had my horomone levels checked- they looked great at 4.5 weeks.  My first ultrasound/heartbeat appt is Monday and my husband is coming to support me.  The only way I'm making it through is pretending I'm not pregnant, which is hard when I am constantly fatigued, having major food aversions, and sometimes suffering terrible morning sickness.  I know that 1 in 100 pregnancies end in a missed miscarriage and there is only a 2% chance of two miscarriages in a row, but I can't shake the cynical attitude and I hate it.  I feel like, "Why should I be happy when the baby is going to die soon anyway?"  Does anyone feel the way I do?  To make matters worse, I have MRSA, which could lead to a staph infection if it's not effectively treated.  Could this hurt the fetus?  How do I stay positive in the midst of everything?     --  DD born 02/19/08 Angel baby March 2010 (9.5 weeks) New baby is due October 29th        See all comments from original poster (3)  Hide all comments from original poster (3)      Load more            Comment            Report this post         8          Comments (26)        / 3                   EDM1984    Posted 03/14/2011      I understand what you are going through. This is my second pregnancy. I m/c back in Dec. So many people I have known have had this carefree pregnancy where they just sit back and enjoy it and all I want is to be at the end of my 1st trimester so I can maybe breathe a sigh of relief. I had my first dr appt today and even though everything checked out fine I'm still sitting here wondering. My hubby and I are actually looking into how much an u/s would be since my insurance only covers one and we still want one between 18-22 wks so we can find out the sex of the baby. We just need that reassurance that they are truly there. Hang in there. I'm sure that it will get better for the both of us.    --  Liz Happily Married to my sweetheart 10/12/2008 Loving Mommy to Marie Elizabeth 10/17/2011             Reply            Report this comment        2                     dolphin_509    Posted 03/15/2011      I had a missed m/c in dec of 09 after seeign the HB at 10weeks and when I got pregnant again I felt the same way.  When I went for my 1st u/s at 7weeks I was sure there would be something wrong, but the baby looked great.  Then I had an appt at 10 weeks to hear the HB and I had a panic attack in the waitin room, but again everything was fine.  After I heard the HB again at 14 weeks I started to feel a little better about the pregnancy and my midwife ordered an u/s at 18w and we saw our little man.  I do not think I ever stopped owrring that something would go wrong and that I would loose this baby too.  But now I have a healthy happy little 2 month old.  I wish you the best and hang in there I can;t really say the worring goes away but try to relax and enjoy the pregnancy.    --  Maureen(31) DH-Chad(34)= DD-Adeline Rose(5/14/06) ^Angel Baby^ 12/22/09& Our  R A I N B O W Jack Eward 1/11/11.

Went to my 1st prenatal appointment only to be told the baby had no HB.   The 2nd I heard the healthy hb at 6 weeks.  Only to find out at 10.5 weeks baby stopped growing just a few days after I heard the HB.  I had a d&c; for both miscarriages...and was ready to just quit.  But I tried one more time for DH.  Got pregnant again in November 2009.  I was a ball of nerves the WHOLE time.  I did not enjoy one minute of my pregnancy.  However I do have my rainbow baby boy who just turned 7 months last week. He was born VERY healthy and happy!    Your right you will never have a care-free pregnancy again.  Sadly a loss or losses take away the joys of pregnancy. Try to make every day special, and try to relax (I know how hard that is- trust me I do).  I kept waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under me my whole pregnancy; my BP would go up before every dr. appointment, I would cry myself to sleep due to worry....but what I realize now is I robbed myself of the joys!   I can't go back and change time but I can tell my story to ladies like you....I really hope you can relax and enjoy cause really there is nothing more you can do but take care of U.  CONGRATS!!  All my best and please keep me posted.    --  Dolores (37) DH (38) Roy; 5/17/2008 DS (17) Brandon 5/16/94- Missed M/C: 3/09 and 7/09 Mason Alexander; August 7, 2010 @ 2:37am  8pds 9oz (Perfect)!

The only difference is that I am 39 years old and I tend to blame my losses on the chromosomal abnormalities associated with age. I lost the first one last June at 6w2d due to trisomy 16. (An extra chromosome being introduced at the time of conception) and a recent loss in January that was an empty sac/blighted ovum. That one totally blew me away because I felt pregnant in every way. It wasn't until I hit 6 1/2 weeks that I sensed something was wrong. I had a few days of diarrhea and it made me nervous. That was on a Wednesday and I had already begun to miscarry that Friday.  By sme miraculous miracle I got pregnant almost immediately again. This was with a large cyst on my right ovary that was later determine to be a failed ovulation. I was wondering why it appeared that I had ovulated, but never got an AF  (Aunt Flo - menstruation/period) two weeks later at all. The pain of it sent me to my doctor who confirmed it. Again, this was on a Wednesday and then I ended up successfully O-ing just 2 days later! DH  (dear husband) and I just decided to go for it and we got pregnant!  I went to my first sono at 5 weeks 4 days and all we saw was the sac and yolksac. The baby was too small at that stage to see. But the doctor seemed to think I was right on track with my own estimations. I am in that horrible stage of waiting myself... my next sono won't be until Monday at 7 weeks 2 days. I won't deny that I am positively dying here. Watching every symptom... nervous when I lose a few... my soar breasts have returned, but aren't nearly as soar as they had been. And my nausea is less severe this week. But I am trying not to worry too much.  I can't agree with you more Teachercoachmom... I try not to view it as a live pregnancy either. I am so afraid of being let down again. This is my last chance due to my age alone. Getting DH  (dear husband) to go along with trying a second time was hard enough. But a third time was a complete miracle. This was not expected, but I sure do hope this is the one!  I wish all of you ladies the very best with all of your pregnancies! Please keep us posted here!!! The support would be so great right about now!!!    --  Eileen(42)Joe(41)DD(19)DS(16)DS(13)DD(6)4 angels 3/91, 6/10, 1/11 &3/11.

And now I almost feel more invested in the pregnancy and a little more vulnerable.  It does make me feel a bit cheated.  I with I could be more excited.    --  ~Waylon James is here!!!~             Reply            Report this comment        3                     Savedmom25    Posted 03/20/2011      I had a miscarriage on March 7th even though the baby died 2 weeks prior is what the doctor told me.

One more week and this baby surpasses how long the last one lived.  I think I will finally relax and "bond" once I get out of the "1st Trimester Danger Zone". Just one more month to "wait it out".  It's going to be a really long month.

Not good... sorry ladies.This will be my 3rd loss in 9 months. I am the exception to the rule because of my age though. So please to all of you young ladies, don't ever lose hope.  My sono showed a babe 6 weeks 1 or 2 days... no HB. I am 7 weeks 2 days without a doubt. I know when I got my first positive test and had bloodwork drawn the same day. They are running my HCG right now. And Progesterone levels. But I know they will either come back in normal range and won't show a drop until they have something to compare it up against. They should repest the draw in 48 hrs. just to be sure. But I know in my gutt that this little one was doomed from the beginning. None of mine have had HB's. I am 4 for 4. I have 4 healthy kids and have had 4 losses. 3 of which I had in less than 9 months time. DH  (dear husband) and I have just the 1 child together and she was apparently a complete miracle. I need to change my views and look at it that way and be grateful for what I do have.  To all of you, please stay strong and don't ever give up.

I've also found it much easier to deal with emotionally to just assume that it's not going to "take." But it is *so* annoying to have the pregnancy symptoms and be modifying my behavior on one hand while assuming it's not real on the other.  Friends who I've told-- who know about the m/c (dec '10 for me)-- are so optimistic and don't seem to understand my attitude.  But the scary thing is I've found myself not wanting this pregnancy to last. I already have 2 kids and I'm suddenly freaked out about whether it was a good decision to try for 3.  I wanted to so badly and now feel like I'm in a completely different place- happy with my family as it is. I don't know if that's a reaction to assuming it won't work out, so I'll feel more positive about it if it does work out.

Then the second one I had no clue cause i still had all my symptons like you. Now this one I am trying to be optismic even though I have seen spotting the last two days and first thing tomorrow morning I am going to the ER and hope they give me some good news. Hope we all have a safe and happy pregnancy. Try not to stress I know it's hard to do but at least we have the fact that we can get pregnant and god forbid something happens we can try again.

Like pp said, ask your doctor for an early u/s-hopefully he or she will let you have one.

While it can be disheartening, it should be good known that, even after having two miscarriages in a row, you have a good chance of going on to have a normal pregnancy that eventually leads to a healthy, happy baby. How many women have miscarriages? The chances of having a miscarriage can be as high as forty percent.  Almost 1 percent of all women will have more than 2-3 miscarriages in a row.  While having this many pregnancy losses can be frustrating, the worst part is that, most of the time, the doctor will be unable to tell you why this has occurred.  There are certain things that can result in recurrent miscarriages and some of these things can involve something you can control in the future. Causes of Recurrent Miscarriage Many women who have recurrent miscarriage want to know what is going on and if there is anything they can do to keep this from happening again.  Even if no cause is found for the recurrent miscarriage, you may still go on to have a healthy baby the next time around.   Even so, it is important to know the possible reasons why you are having 2 miscarriages in a row as there may be a cause that can be treated that will lead to a healthy pregnancy if you decide to try again.  The main causes of recurrent miscarriage are generally quite rare and include the following: There can be a hormonal problem such as is seen in gynecological disease like polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition where there are many cysts on the ovaries, leading to an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage. Having bacterial vaginosis, which is when you have a bacterial infection of the vaginal tissues. It is associated with recurrent miscarriages. Having a genetic problem. This means that either the mother or father has a chromosomal abnormality that leads to recurrent miscarriages.  The chances of this are 2-5 percent of couples. Having thrombophilia, a condition where there are too many platelets in the system and your chances of having a blood clot is higher than average as is your chances of having a miscarriage. Having antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which also called Hughes syndrome. APS occurs in 15-20 percent of cases of recurrent miscarriage.  There Is also a risk of blood clots in and outside of the pregnancy. Increased age. Women over the age of 35 years have an increased risk of having a miscarriage.  Men over the age of 40 also can yield a pregnancy that ends in miscarriage. Having more than one previous miscarriage increases the odds that your next pregnancy will also end in miscarriage. Remember that these are uncommon conditions and that most of the time, no cause can be found as to why you are having recurrent miscarriage. Tests and Treatment for Recurrent Miscarriages Once you have had at least 2 miscarriages in a row, your family practice doctor or midwife should have you see an obstetrical/gynecological specialist for testing to see why this problem is recurrent.  Tests you should expect includes the following: Testing for antiphospholipid syndrome—this is a test that looks for antibodies to phospholipids in your system. Often it takes more than one test to see if this is the problem or not.  If the test shows antiphospholipid syndrome, there are things you can do that can prevent a future miscarriage. Testing for chromosomal abnormalities—this is also known as karyotyping. This is when both the man and the woman is tested to see if they have any genetic cause for the disease. If this test shows a problem, a genetic counselor may be required, who will help you decide whether or not you will have a healthy baby in the future. Testing for chromosome problems in the fetus—this means testing the fetal tissue for genetic testing rather than testing each parent. Testing for infection—if an infection is detected and treated, you should have a normal pregnancy the next time around. Ultrasound testing—in this case, the ultrasound is looking for abnormalities in the size or shape of the uterus. Some uterine abnormalities can be surgically managed so that you can have a normal pregnancy in the future.  An ultrasound can also diagnose a shortening or weakness of the cervix as a cause of recurrent miscarriage.  If this is the case, you may have to have a uterine cerclage during your next pregnancy, which will keep the cervix from dilating prematurely. Chances of having a Normal Pregnancy in the Future If no known cause can be found as to why you have had 2-3 miscarriages in a row, you have a decent chance of having a healthy baby the next time around.  You can be checked out by an early pregnancy unit team (EPU team), which will provide close care for you once you become pregnant again.  About 75 percent of women with recurrent pregnancies that are unable to be explained will go on to have a healthy pregnancy in the future. If the problem is something related to chromosomal abnormalities, your chances of having a healthy pregnancy the next time around depends on what type of chromosomal abnormality is found.  Some chromosome abnormalities don’t show up in every pregnancy so there is every reason to suspect that a normal pregnancy is in the future.  You just need to continue to try again. Remember that some causes of recurrent miscarriage are preventable the next time you try to become pregnant.  This is why you should see an OB/GYN doctor, who is familiar with recurrent miscarriages and who will be able to find out why you are having so many miscarriages in a row and may be able to treat some of these causes of recurrent miscarriage. Support for Recurrent Miscarriage If you have had 2-3 miscarriages in a row, you may wish to join a forum in which other women have had similar experiences. There you can find support for your problem and can meet up electronically with other women who have suffered from the same problem and can provide you with tips for a healthy pregnancy the next time or can simply offer support and compassion for what you are going through.

Does a past miscarriage increase the chances of it happening again?   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Q: I had a miscarriage during my last pregnancy. What are the chances of it happening again? A: Miscarriage is a devastating, but very common, pregnancy occurrence. You should know that most women (more than 85 percent) who miscarry are able to get pregnant again and give birth to healthy babies. Since most miscarriages occur totally randomly, having one does not increase your risk of experiencing a subsequent pregnancy loss. Your chance of miscarrying again is about the same as that of any other mom-to-be -- about 15 percent for most women under 35 (miscarriage risk increases with maternal age). But even after two miscarriages, your risk of having a third only goes up slightly -- and many doctors won't start testing for health conditions that affect miscarriage (like uterine problems, hormone imbalances, or chronic medical conditions) until after you've had two or three. Research shows that nearly 75 percent of women who've had three miscarriages in a row -- rare as that is -- go on to have healthy pregnancies and babies.

I had (if you have a weak stomach, I'd stop ready, because what I'm going to say may be disgusting) a real heavy period the 1st day.. I wore a tampon to be and when I woke up, there was like a 3 inch blooding clump.. (sorry I told ya, it was going to be disgustin) So I don't know if I had a miscarriage or not. What do you think?

Now I just found out on New Years Eve I'm pregnant, I didn't have to have a d&c before will that increase chances of miscarrying again?

Reply                 Loading...             xHariiex123991  over a year ago    I have been with my fiancee for a few years now and just over one year ago we decided to try for a baby. nothing happened for the first six months however in december i fell pregnant, and on the 25th of January i miscarried. I have honestly never know any pain like it. We were both so happy because although we were only trying for six months it felt like a life time!!! especially as some people only have to have intercourse once and they fall pregnant. Around about the same time my friend fell pregnant but she decided to have an abortion. It is probably the most horrible thing to say but i really did and still do wish our situations were swapped over. We really wanted our baby. The emotional pain that accompanies a miscarrige is ridiculous. Our relationship took a turn for the worst because i wanted to talk about our loss because we had built dreams in the month that i was pregnant and spoke about general baby things as you would then our dream was snatched as well as our babys life. Although i wanted to talk about our loss my partner didnt. he used to make jokes about it as a way to deal with it, which was very hurtful on my part although i understood. eventually we spoke about it and he broke down and now we are on the road to recovery and are learning to deal with our loss. Then in April i was 2 weeks late on my period. i didnt want to take a test incase of putting bad luck on it. Sounds silly. But then i had almost the same symtoms as i did in january so i think i may have miscarried again. Then in July i found i was pregnant again however miscarried again...yes again, a few weeks into my pregnancy. We are both absolutely devestated and all we want is a baby. Never realised it would take this long. The emotional strain this has put us under is rather bad. I keep looking on websites to try and justify my miscarriges but nothing as yet has helped. So now...Mid september i am currently ovulating...fingers crossed. I know that sperm can stay inside a woman for up to seven days and that having intercourse in the seven days leading up to ovulation and during can increase your chances of getting pregnant. I am mid ovulation and today i woke up and was sick. I have been sick about 3 times today and also felt unwell yestoday and had a headache and back pain and have not been able to keep any food down and feel sick at the sight of food. Do you think there is a possiblity of another pregnancy?? I think about being pregnant every single day and we want nothing more than to have a baby. The more i want it the less it seems to happen. Do you think i should make an appointment with my gp and speak to him about the miscarriges? It sounds so silly but i have been putting it off because i feel ashamed...it was my baby and i failed to keep it safe. Maybe if i had done something different my baby would be here within the next month. Any advice would be greatly apreciated. Thank you.

Can you tell me if there's anything else healthwise I'd need to know about?

I do have a curved spine but as far as i know and have been informed this is not a risk factor in a pregnancy. Everything thing else is as it should be...or as far as i know.     Reply                 Loading...             bluedog114369  over a year ago    My understanding of the situation (and I know this sounds odd) is that you would have to have at least four miscarriages before they would consider the possibility that there is some sort of underlying condition. Have ou been checked for PCOS? That is usually a pretty common condition that affects your ability to get pregnant.     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    Have you checked if you are positive blood type and he is negative? Because when i miscarried it was one of the first things they asked. Your body can reject the baby if you guys have opposite blood type. There is a shot for it, to get rid of the chances of that happening.     Reply                 Loading...

I've had two miscarriages in a row now. The first was in Feb 2010 at about 11.5 weeks (although the baby stopped developing around 6.5 weeks we found out). The second was in early August this year as well and I was 5.5 weeks. I don't have any children yet. I'm 26 and healthy as far as I know. I have an appt tomorrow with a fertility specialist and I'm feeling nervous about it. I'm worried I'll never have a child, that something major is wrong with me. And I'm scared to get pregnant again. Going through those miscarriages was the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. To make it worse, I recently threw a baby shower for my sister and she had the baby less than a week ago, and it seems like everyone I know is pregnant right now. Oh well, I guess that's just how it is, and everything always seems worse at night anyway... Thank you for reading. I feel a little better already getting that off my chest. Tammy Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  16 Posts t  tomest obviously I haven't posted in awhile, my ticker still says I'm pregnant... L  Liz1219 I'm so sorry for your losses. I found this board when I had my loss 2 weeks ago and it really helps the grieving process. I wish you the best in the future. T  TBMomma23 @tomest  I am so sorry to hear what you are going through, i totally understand.  I had an m/c in May and just had a d&c last Friday.  Both times the baby stopped developing around 7 weeks and both times I had to have a d&c.  I am 35 so they have tested the babies both times - the first was trisomy 13 and we are still waiting for the results on this one.  My husband and I just had chromosonal testing and once we get the results from everything I am hoping that we will have a much more clear direction of what we can do.  I do know that I only waited one cycle between the two and even though I don't want to wait - I feel like that is probably best for my body to rest at least a few more cycles. I wish you the best of luck and maybe they will find it is something relatively easy to solvesuch as giving progesterone.  Sorry I don't have nay answers but sometimes its nice to know your not alone.  It also helps me to hear stories where the 3rd time is a charm :) t  tomest Thank you for the encouragement. I really just want to figure out what is wrong with me! d  dhearne @tomest  Tammy: I know exactly what you are going through.  I had my first mc at 5.5 weeks in April and my second mc at 11 weeks a few weeks ago. I am 26 with no children.  It does seem like everyone is pregnant right now, but I think I just notice more now.  I am interested to see how your appointment with the specialist goes.  I insisted on testing from my doctor, and I couldn't get in to see the specialist for testing until November.  If you can, will you let me know how the appointment goes?  I am nervous about it as well, but I've tried not to think too much about it.  I too am worried that there is something wrong with me.  I've done some research and it seems to me that most of the causes of recurrent miscarriage are pretty treatable and that most people go on to have a baby.  I try to think about that and hope that if there is something wrong it's treatable.  I don't think I really helped too much.  Just know that you are not alone! -Danielle t  thevioletfemme @tomest  I'm with you, and so sorry for your loss:( I had my first end of may, and my second 1st of sept. 3 months apart mc's:( My dr won't refer me to a specialist until at least 1 more MC which i pray doesn't happen, so please tell me what happens, I'm really upset that I feel like there's nothing i can do right now to try and prevent another one.  t  tomest @thevioletfemme  I'm sorry for your losses as well. I hope the third time works out for you so you don't have to go through that heartbreak again. Why don't you go see a specialist on your own? Or do you need the referral for insurance purposes? Good luck this next time around. Let me know if you need to talk (my email address is above). Tammy d  dhearne @thevioletfemme  I just wanted to tell you that my doctor didn't want to do any testing, but I insisted.  He gave me "your young, you can try again" and "sometimes these things just happen" speaches.  I told him I needed to do it for my peace of mind not just for medical reasons.  After a few conversations I was able to get him to refer me to the specialist.  I agree with Tammy if your insurance will allow it I would try to get your own appointment with a specialist.  That was my plan before I talked the doctor into testing. d  dhearne @tomest  Wow...that's a lot of stuff.  I can see how it could be overwhelming.  It sounds like I will have plenty to focus on once the testing gets started so that's good.  Don't feel like an idiot about the crying...I cry all the time now!  I cried in the doctor's office saying the word miscarriage trying to convince him to give me the referral.  Please keep me posted.  It would be nice to have someone to talk to that's going through the same thing.  I hope you are able to find answers.  Thanks for letting me know about your appointment.  Good Luck! -  @tomest  Tammy- I just want to try to give you a little hope. I went through the same thing.... two super early losses with no explanation. I was 24 for both losses with no known health problems. I had blood tests and an HSG after the second loss, and they couldn't find anything to explain the problems. I was terrified to try again, but DH and I just decided to rip the bandaid off and take a leap of faith. I am writing this today 23 weeks pregnant with a perfectly healthy little boy- have had no complications to date, and he is actually measuring 4 days ahead. You may find after testing that there is something they can do to help you stay pregnant, but that was not the case for me. It was so frustrating to be told it was simply "bad luck" rather than them telling me there was something they could DO. But for us, the third time really was the charm. I know this is SO much easier said than done, but try not to give up hope. -Sarah s  shera182201 @thevioletfemme  I am so sorry you're going through this.  Medical care should be about working together to do what's best for you, not just what seems to cover everybody else.  If your doctor refuses to refer you, I'd say get another doctor!  In the meantime, there are things you could do to help prevent another one.  I am not a doctor, and I certainly don't know if there could be medical reasons for you not to follow these suggestions, but here they are anyway: you could take a daily baby aspirin, and in addition to continuing to take your prenatal vitamins, you could also take extra folic acid, like an extra 400mg.  It doesn't sound like much, but at least it's proactive.  Chances are your miscarriages truly are just bad luck, but wouldn't it be better to rule out everything else??  Stick to your guns! t  tomest So I posted this thread a while ago and I'm not sure if anyone is still interested, but I thought I'd give an update. I've been to many many appts with my fertility dr. He said he doesn't think the 2 m/c's were related. I had tons of bloodwork done. Everything looks normal, but they still have me taking an extra 400 mcg of folic acid twice daily, plus 81 mg of aspirin in addition to prenatal vitamins. I told the doc it didn't make sense to me since the bloodwork was normal, but he said it won't hurt and why not give the next baby every chance to make it, so I agreed to keep taking it. I also had a hysterpscopy that showed a slight uterine septum so they fixed that. They said this could have been the cause of m/c. Also further bloodwork and u/s showed that I ovulate late and hence my progesterone is a little low, so that could also cause m/c. The dr put me on Clomid this month in order to manipulate my ovulation and hormone levels (he assured me it's not because of lack of ovulation or anything). So this month we are trying to conceive...and I'm so scared to let myself get too excited. I am trying to take it one day at a time. I'm not desparate to be pregnant at this exact moment, but I feel like I need to try now while the dr is monitoring me. I don't want to risk another m/c if I can avoid it. I know I could still m/c again but I'm trying not to think about it. I think sometimes I'm in denial that there's anything wrong with me. Sometimes I still feel like "why am I putting myself through all this? I could have had bad luck twice and I could have a perfectly normal pregnancy next time" but then I remember how hard it was to go through those m/c and I'm glad I'm doing it this way. Who wouldn't want to have everything happen naturally and be surprised, etc? That's just not my reality at this point! Haha. Anyway, I'm thinking positive and hopefully I'll have good news soon! If not, there's always next month! Thanks for reading, Tammy S  StephMB @tomest  Tammy - It sounds like you've been through alot. Good for you trying again! I really hope it works AND sticks. Keep me posted! Stephanie l  liz09storn @tomest  Thanks so much for posting! Â I just found out that we lost our 2nd pregnancy on Friday - the baby only measured 6wk2d, which was the same that it had measured 2 weeks before. We lost our first at the end of April - again I was nearly 9 weeks and the baby measured less than 6. Â I'll be getting testing in about a month or so, so it was really helpful to hear what you went through.Â Good luck! Â Your positive attitude will get you really far :-) -Liz  t  tomest Thanks ladies, I'll keep you posted! Liz- I'm so sorry for your losses. But you never have to feel like you're alone, that's why I love these boards...there's always someone who knows what you're going through! (although I do wish there weren't quite so many of us who knew the pain of m/c) Good luck with your testing next month and let me know how it goes!

Will I have a third?     2005-05-26T21:17:34.000Z  By Dr. Judith Reichman   TODAY               Popular on TODAY.com     Seth Meyers reveals baby son was born in the lobby of his apartment building    Canadian bus crash mourners suffer new tragedy: Mix-up in victim's identity    Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson have the best response to poll comparing them    Amal Clooney opens up about falling for George, reveals twins' first word    PetSmart facing allegations of mistreatment after dog deaths                share     tweet     email     Q: I’m in my late 20s. I’ve had two miscarriages and I’m so afraid of having another one if I try again. What should I do?   A: Let me start with an encouraging piece of information: the odds are that you won’t. Your two miscarriages might have simply been due to chance.  The “usual” risk for miscarrying a pregnancy in your 20s is 15 percent. If you’re younger than 30 and have had three miscarriages — and especially if you’ve had no living births — your chance of having this recur is about 25 percent.  If you’ve had four miscarriages, your condition is now categorized as recurrent pregnancy loss, or RPL, and your risk does go up to about 40 percent.  For women over 30, the picture is different — these numbers do increase with age.  In order to understand why pregnancies fail, lets first look at what is required for a successful pregnancy (aside from the requisite sperm meeting an egg):  A normally developed uterus that allows for implantation and growth Adequate hormonal support Immunologic acceptance (the immune system doesn’t attempt to expel the fetus as an unwanted foreign object) A normal fetus with genetic material compatible for development A sterile uterine environment devoid of toxic substances  Now let’s look at when, why and how often one of these prerequisites goes bad. Fifty percent of women who have RPL have some type of anatomic uterine problem that interferes with implantation and growth of a pregnancy such as:  The development of only one horn of the uterus (a unicornuate uterus) The failure of the two halves of the uterus to meet during development (a didelphic uterus) The failure of the halves to meet completely (a bicornuate uterus) The development of a wedge shaped septum in the uterine cavity  There can also be developmental or trauma-caused deformations of the cervix which contribute to miscarriage:  Incompetent cervix. The cervix is short, weak or partially open so that it dilates from the pressure of the growing pregnancy; the membranes then prematurely rupture and a second trimester miscarriage results. Occasionally, scarring of the uterine lining (from a D&C or a past infection) prevents appropriate growth of the fetus. In this case, pregnancy doesn’t occur at all or, once started, does not develop and aborts.   Hormonal issues Another very common cause for early RPLs (15 percent or more) is hormonal inadequacy. The amount of progesterone produced after ovulation may not be sufficient to keep the lining of the uterus built up so that it can support the pregnancy. It begins to slough and the pregnancy is lost. This occurs more frequently in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (symptoms of which include irregular periods, weight gain, excess hair growth and acne).  Up to 60 percent of very early miscarriages (before 10 weeks gestation) are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. When pregnancy occurs, half of the chromosomes come from the mother’s egg and the other half from her partner’s sperm. They have to match up and keep their information straight in order for the pregnancy to develop. If there is a lapse of genetic completion, the pregnancy can’t develop and eventually is expelled.  This poor pregnancy outcome usually is not correlated with an abnormality in your or your partner’s genetic makeup; it occurs by chance during chromosomal partnering — a transaction so complicated that it’s amazing that it turns out right in the majority of pregnancies. However, if it happens with three or more pregnancies and tests of the products of conception show specific chromosomal abnormalities, there is a 3 to 6 percent chance that an abnormality in your or your partner’s chromosomes is being passed on to the fetus.   Immune systems and environment An overactive immune system can sometimes cause rejection of a pregnancy. This is more frequent in women with lupus, but abnormal antibodies can also be present in perfectly healthy women who have no history of autoimmune disease.  Finally, there is no question that certain environmental toxins can increase the risk of pregnancy loss. Smoking is the biggest threat to a successful pregnancy: just 10 cigarettes a day greatly increase risk of miscarriage. (Consuming two or more alcoholic drinks a day will also up your risk.) Meanwhile, one thing you should put in your mouth when you’re trying to get pregnant is folic acid — at least 1,000 micrograms a day — which can be obtained from any prenatal vitamin.   When to test Most experts don’t do an extensive medical workup after one or two miscarriages, but because a miscarriage is such a traumatic experience and you don’t want to take a chance of enduring it yet another time, you might want to ask your doctor to perform some basic exams. These include:  A pelvic ultrasound after ovulation to make sure your uterine lining has become thick. This will also check for fibroid tumors that could prevent fetal growth. An X-ray of your uterine cavity to rule out malformations (hysterosalpinography) A blood test for your progesterone level on Day 21 of your menstrual cycle A test of your blood thyroid (TSH) level A cervical culture Autoantibody testing  Only after three or possibly four miscarriages would I suggest chromosomal testing of the expelled products of conception and/or genetic tests for you and your partner (a very costly procedure). Once you are pregnant, several tests can reassure you that the pregnancy is “good.” These include blood tests for a hormone called HCG. The hormone is produced by placenta cells and should double every 48 hours the first ten weeks of your pregnancy. In addition, by your sixth week, you can have an ultrasound to check for the fetus’ heartbeat. Once a heartbeat is found and the HCG test is normal, your chances of miscarriage decrease to probably less than 5 percent.   Dr. Reichman’s Bottom Line: Having had two miscarriages does not mean a third is inevitable. On the contrary, chances are your next attempt will be successful. Your doctor can perform some basic tests to ensure that there are no underlying problems and help you attain peace of mind.

What are the odds of miscarrying again? Get the facts about pregnancy after miscarriage. By Mayo Clinic Staff    Thinking about pregnancy after miscarriage? You might be feeling anxious or confused about what caused your miscarriage and when to conceive again. Here's help understanding pregnancy after miscarriage, and the steps you can take to promote a healthy pregnancy.   What causes miscarriage?    Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. Many miscarriages occur because the fetus isn't developing normally. Problems with the baby's chromosomes are responsible for about 50 percent of early pregnancy loss. Most of these chromosome problems occur by chance as the embryo divides and grows — not because of problems inherited from the parents. Sometimes a health condition, such as poorly controlled diabetes or a uterine problem, might lead to miscarriage. Often, however, the cause of miscarriage isn't known.  About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. The total number of actual miscarriages is probably higher because many women miscarry before they even know that they're pregnant.   What are the odds of another miscarriage?    Miscarriage is usually a one-time occurrence. Most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies after miscarriage. A small number of women — 1 percent — will have two or more miscarriages.  The predicted risk of miscarriage in a future pregnancy remains about 14 percent after one miscarriage. After two miscarriages the risk of another miscarriage increases to about 26 percent, and after three miscarriages the risk of another miscarriage is about 28 percent.   Are special tests recommended before attempting pregnancy after miscarriage?    If you experience two or more consecutive miscarriages, talk with your health care provider about whether further testing is needed to identify any underlying causes before attempting to get pregnant again. For example:   Blood tests. A sample of your blood is evaluated to help detect problems with hormones or your immune system.  Chromosomal tests. You and your partner might both have your blood tested to determine if your chromosomes are a factor. Tissue from the miscarriage — if it's available — also might be tested.   Procedures can be done to detect uterine problems. For example:   Ultrasound. This imaging method uses high-frequency sound waves to produce precise images of structures within the body. Your health care provider places the ultrasound device (transducer) over your abdomen or places it inside your vagina to obtain images of your uterus. An ultrasound might identify uterine problems such as fibroids within the uterine cavity.  Hysteroscopy. Your health care provider inserts a thin, lighted instrument called a hysteroscope through your cervix into your uterus to diagnose and treat identified intrauterine problems.  Hysterosalpingography. Your health care provider inserts a catheter inside your cervix, which releases a liquid contrast material into your uterus. The dye traces the shape of your uterine cavity and fallopian tubes and makes them visible on X-ray images. This procedure provides information about the internal contours of the uterus and any obstructions in the fallopian tubes.  Sonohysterogram. This ultrasound scan is done after fluid is injected into your uterus though your vagina and cervix. This procedure provides information about the internal contours of the uterus, the outer surface of the uterus and any obstructions in the fallopian tubes.   If the cause of your miscarriages can't be identified, don't lose hope. Most women who experience repeated miscarriages are likely to eventually have healthy pregnancies.

Ultrasound scans  Ultrasound scans in pregnancy may be routine or they may be offered because of pain or bleeding or because of problems in a previous pregnancy.  There are two ways of doing an ultrasound scan.  In early pregnancy, especially before 11 weeks, it is usual to have a trans-vaginal (internal) scan , where a probe is placed in the vagina.  This gives the clearest and most accurate picture in early pregnancy.  It may also be offered after 11 or 12 weeks if a trans-abdominal scan doesn’t give a clear enough picture.  From 11 or 12 weeks, including at the routine booking-in scan, it is more common  to have a trans-abdominal scan .  The person doing the scan spreads a special gel on your lower abdomen (below your belly button and above the line of pubic hair).  He or she then moves the scanner over the gel, sometimes pressing down, until the uterus (womb) and pregnancy can be seen.  What if I don’t want an internal scan?  If you don’t want a trans-vaginal scan, you can ask for a trans-abdominal scan. That may give some information about your pregnancy, but it is less clear than an internal scan and that could possibly delay diagnosis.  Can ultrasound scans harm the baby?  There is no evidence that having a vaginal or an abdominal scan will cause a miscarriage or harm your baby. If you bleed after a vaginal scan, it will most likely be because there was already blood pooled higher in the vagina and the probe dislodged it.  When can I have an ultrasound scan? When can you see the baby’s heartbeat?  An ultrasound scan may be able to detect a pregnancy and a heartbeat in a normal pregnancy at around 6 weeks, but this varies a great deal and isn’t usually advised.  All too often, a scan at 6 weeks shows very little or nothing, even in a perfectly developing pregnancy, whereas waiting a week or 10 days will make the findings much clearer.  Routine scans  Most pregnant women are referred for their first routine (or booking) ultrasound scan somewhere between 11 and 14 weeks of pregnancy.  The purpose of the scan is:   to confirm that there is a heartbeat  to assess the baby’s size and growth  to estimate the delivery date and  to check whether there is one baby, or twins or more.   Some women may be offered a nuchal scan between 11 and 14 weeks. The purpose of this scan is to try to detect some chromosome abnormalities, such as Downs syndrome.  Many hospitals also offer a further anomaly scan at 20 weeks, making a more detailed check of the baby’s development.  You can find out more about routine, nuchal and anomaly scans at the website of the charity ARC – Antenatal Results and Choices  Sadly…  Sadly, sometimes these scans show that the baby has died, possibly some weeks earlier and often without any signs or symptoms such as bleeding or pain. This is often called a “missed”, “silent” or “delayed” miscarriage. This can come as a considerable shock and it may take time before you can take this information in.  You may also have to make some difficult decisions about how to manage the miscarriage process. You can read more about this here.  Early scans  You may be referred for an early scan because of vaginal bleeding or spotting, or possibly because you have had problems in a previous pregnancy.  The best time to have a scan is from about 7 weeks’ gestation when it should be possible to see the baby’s heartbeat in a normal pregnancy . But it can be hard to detect a heartbeat in early pregnancy and in those cases it can be hard to know whether the baby has died or not developed at all, or whether it is simply smaller than expected but still developing.  For that reason, you may be asked to return for another scan a week or so later.  At that time, the person doing the scan will be looking for a clear difference in the size of the pregnancy sac and for a developing baby and a heartbeat.  Sometimes, it can take several scans before you know for sure what is happening.  It can be very stressful dealing with this uncertainty – some women describe it as being “in limbo”.  You may need to find some support for yourself if this happens to you.  There’s a heartbeat, but I’m still bleeding…  If the scan does pick up a heartbeat and the baby appears to be the right size according to your dates, this can be very reassuring, even if you are still bleeding.  Research amongst women with a history of recurrent miscarriage has shown that those who saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks of pregnancy had a 78% chance of the pregnancy continuing.  It also showed that seeing a heartbeat at 8 weeks increased the chance of a continuing pregnancy to 98% and at 10 weeks that went up to 99.4%.  The numbers may be even more positive for women without previous miscarriages.  So things could still go wrong and sadly sometimes do, but as long as there is a heartbeat, the risk of miscarriage decreases as the weeks go by.  Other investigations  In some cases, if there is no sign of a pregnancy in the uterus, you may be given a blood test and possibly asked to return two days later for a repeat test.  These blood tests measure the level of the pregnancy hormone ßhCG. In a normally developing pregnancy the hormone levels double about every 48 hours and if the pattern is different, this can help to identify what is happening to the pregnancy.  If there is no sign of a pregnancy in the uterus and you have symptoms that suggest ectopic pregnancy, you are more likely to have both a blood test and an investigation called a laparoscopy, which is done under general anaesthetic. You can read more about this in our leaflet Ectopic pregnancy .  Ultrasound scan results – and what they mean  The ultrasound scan may show:   A viable ongoing pregnancy.  There is a heartbeat (or heartbeats if it’s a twin or multiple pregnancy) and the pregnancy is the “right size for dates” – that is, the size that would be expected based on the first day of your last period.  Those are positive signs, but if you continue to bleed, you may need a further scan in a week or two to check what’s happening.    An ongoing pregnancy that suggests a problem.  The pregnancy may be much smaller than it should be according to dates or the heartbeat might be particularly slow or faint.  Perhaps there is something that suggests a problem with the baby’s development. With a twin or multiple pregnancy, the scan may show that one (or more) baby has a heartbeat and one (or more) doesn’t.  You may be asked to come back for another scan, possibly in a week or two when things should be clearer.    A pregnancy of unknown location (PUL).  The pregnancy is not visible and it’s not clear what is happening.  You may be asked to come back for another scan, possibly in a week or two when things should be clearer.  Or if the doctor thinks you might have an ectopic pregnancy, you will have blood tests and/or a laparoscopy (keyhole surgery to look inside the abdomen).    A complete miscarriage.  The pregnancy has miscarried.  There may still be a small amount of pregnancy tissue or blood in the uterus.    A non-viable pregnancy. This means a pregnancy that hasn’t survived but hasn’t yet miscarried.  You may hear this described in one of the following ways:      Missed miscarriage (also called silent or delayed miscarriage or early embryonic demise) This is where the baby has died or failed to develop but your body has not miscarried him or her. The scan picture shows a pregnancy sac with a baby (or fetus or embryo) inside, but there is no heartbeat and the pregnancy looks smaller than it should be at this stage.  You may have had little or no sign that anything was wrong and you may still feel pregnant.        Blighted ovum or anembryonic pregnancy (which means a pregnancy without an embryo). This is a rather old-fashioned way of describing a missed miscarriage (see above). The scan picture usually shows an empty pregnancy sac.        Incomplete miscarriage The process of miscarriage has started but there is still pregnancy tissue in the uterus (womb) and you may still have pain and heavy bleeding.     In all of these situations, the pregnancy will fully miscarry with time, but there are several ways of managing the process. You may be offered a choice, or the hospital might make a recommendation. In most cases, you should be able to have time to think about what you can best cope with. You can read more here .  The ultrasound scan might show   An ectopic pregnancy . This means a pregnancy that is developing outside the uterus (Ectopic means “out of place”). Ectopic pregnancies usually develop in one of the Fallopian tubes, but they can develop elsewhere inside the abdomen.    A molar pregnancy . This is a pregnancy where the baby can’t develop but the cells of the placenta grow very quickly. It can’t always be diagnosed on scan so you might find out only after the miscarriage.

Ectopic pregnancy  Ectopic pregnancy can be a very distressing and frightening experience. This leaflet aims to explain what ectopic pregnancy is, to provide you with information and to answer some of the most common questions about both facts and feelings.

How common is recurrent miscarriage?  What causes recurrent miscarriage?  What tests and treatment can I have?  What are my chances of having a healthy baby?  Where can I get support?    What is recurrent miscarriage? If you have three or more miscarriages in a row, doctors call it recurrent miscarriage. If you have experienced recurrent miscarriage, your GP or midwife will refer you to a gynaecologist. Your gynaecologist will try to identify the reason for your losses.  Having miscarriage after miscarriage may leave you feeling utterly drained of hope. At times, it may be hard to keep trusting in the future.  If you can, try to draw comfort from the fact that most women who experience recurrent losses do go on to have a baby. This is especially the case if tests can find no reason for the losses (RCOG 2012, Kaandorp et al 2014) . Six out of 10 women who have had three miscarriages will go on to have a baby in their next pregnancy (RCOG 2012) . How common is recurrent miscarriage? About one woman in 100 experiences recurrent miscarriage. Frustratingly, it's often unclear why it keeps happening to some women. Doctors can't find a reason in about half the cases of recurrent miscarriage (Duckitt and Qureshi 2011, Whitley et al 2013) .  But some problems that cause some women to miscarry again and again can be identified. What causes recurrent miscarriage? When you have endured recurrent miscarriage, the one question you'll probably want answered is: "Why is this happening?" Even if no reason is found for the miscarriages, it may still mean there's the chance of a successful pregnancy happening next time.  Some health conditions are known to lead to miscarriage. Others have been linked to it, but it's not fully understood how or why they may play a part. Experts are continually finding out more about what causes recurrent miscarriage.  Conditions that are known to lead to recurrent miscarriage are often uncommon. They include:    A problem that makes your blood clot when it shouldn't. This is called antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as sticky blood syndrome or Hughes syndrome (RCOG 2012) . APS has been found in between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of recurrent miscarriages (Duckitt and Qureshi 2011, Newson 2013, RCOG 2011) .  An inherited blood-clotting disorder, called thrombophilia. It's similar to APS, but is something you are born with rather than acquire. Thrombophilia means that your blood may be more likely to clot than normal (Newson 2013) . This could cause recurrent miscarriage (RCOG 2012) .  Genetic problems. You or your partner may have an abnormality on one of your chromosomes, which doesn't cause a problem until it is passed on to your baby. Recurrent miscarriage is thought to be linked to chromosomal abnormality for between two per cent and five per cent of couples (Newson 2013, RCOG 2011, 2012) .  Problems with your womb (uterus) or cervix. You may have a womb that has an abnormal shape (Newson 2013) , or a weak cervix (Newson 2013) .  Bacterial vaginosis, a vaginal infection, increases the risk of late miscarriage and premature birth (Newson 2013) . Doctors are still finding out about how and why infections like this may cause recurrent miscarriage (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  A problem with your hormones. Some conditions, such as polycystic ovaries have been linked to recurrent miscarriage (Newson 2013, RCOG 2011) . But, as yet, it's not fully understood why they are linked and how well treatments work (RCOG 2011) .  There are also some lifestyle factors that can affect the risk of miscarriage. Learn more on Tommy's website .  It may simply be that your age is having an effect. The older you are, the more likely you are to experience miscarriage (Newson 2013) . The age of your baby's father may also increase the risk of miscarriage (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  And added to this, it's a sad fact that the risk of a further miscarriage does increase slightly with each miscarriage (RCOG 2011) .  From about the age of 35, the number of your eggs and their quality starts to decline more quickly (RCOG 2011, Newson 2013) . This can make the genetic material in your eggs more likely to go wrong during fertilisation. A chromosomal abnormality in your baby is therefore more likely to happen and this, in turn, increases the likelihood of miscarriage (RCOG 2011) .  Despite all these possible causes, it often turns out that a reason for recurrent miscarriage cannot be found (RCOG 2011) . This is called unexplained recurrent miscarriage. As more is discovered about what causes recurrent miscarriage, the number of unexplained cases may fall. What tests and treatment can I have? If you have had three or more miscarriages in a row, your GP should refer you to a gynaecologist. Your gynaecologist may be part of a recurrent miscarriage clinic, such as Tommy's National Miscarriage Research Centre . She will try to find out why you keep having miscarriages. You should be offered the following:   Tests   You can have blood tests to check for APS, or sticky blood syndrome (Newson 2013) . Tests will look for antibodies that go with the condition (RCOG 2011) . Antibodies are chemicals that our bodies produce to fight infection. It takes two tests, at least six weeks apart, to find out for sure whether you have APS (Newson 2013) .  If you do have APS, with the right care from your doctor, you have a good chance of a successful pregnancy. Next time you're pregnant, your doctor will offer you blood-thinning medicines such as aspirin and heparin (Empson et al 2005) to treat APS.  You and your partner can have blood tests to check for chromosomal abnormalities. This is called karyotyping (Newson 2013) . If an abnormality is discovered, you and your partner should be referred to a clinical genetics specialist and for genetic counselling.  A counsellor can explain what the abnormality is and talk you through your chances of having a healthy pregnancy.  Sometimes, though, tests don't provide answers (RCOG 2011,2012) . If your doctor can't find a reason for your miscarriages you could see it as a reason for better luck next time, if you want to keep trying . Or you may be very upset that there is no explanation for your loss, and frustrated that there isn't a fix that can be tried.  Your doctor may offer more tests if you have another miscarriage. You may consent to tests of the pregnancy tissues that are lost or to a post mortem of your baby, if you had a late miscarriage (RCOG 2011, RCOG 2012) . These tests can look for chromosome problems.  Tissues from the placenta may also be tested for signs of a problem. If an abnormality is discovered then there is a better chance of you having a successful pregnancy next time. That's because the abnormality is likely to be a one-off.   Ultrasound scans   Your doctor should offer an ultrasound scan to check your womb. A scan may show an abnormality that's been making pregnancy difficult (Jaslow and Kutteh 2013, Newson 2013, RCOG 2011) . Depending on the abnormality, it may still be possible for you to have a successful pregnancy. For example, some abnormalities can be put right by surgery (Kowalik etal 2011, Sugiura-Ogasawara et al 2013) .  If you have a suspected weak or short cervix , you may be offered extra scans in your next pregnancy (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  It can be hard for your doctor to find out if you have weak cervix when you are not pregnant. Your doctor may suspect this is the case if, in a previous pregnancy, your waters broke early, or if your cervix opened painlessly (RCOG 2012) .  During your next pregnancy, it may be possible to have a minor operation to put a stitch in your cervix. This can help to stop you miscarrying again. There are pros and cons to this procedure, which your doctor will explain to you (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  Both abnormalities of the womb and cervical weakness are rare conditions (RCOG 2011) . What are my chances of having a healthy baby? If your miscarriages are unexplained then you have a good chance of having a successful pregnancy in the future (Kaandorp et al 2014) . You'll be looked after very carefully and given extra support and scans from the beginning of your pregnancy.  A dedicated team will look after you in an early pregnancy unit (EPU), if there's one near you. This close care and support in itself can increase your chances of a successful pregnancy (RCOG 2011, Whitley et al 2013) . About three quarters of women who have unexplained recurrent losses have a healthy baby eventually with the right support and care (Duckitt and Qureshi 2011, RCOG 2011, 2012) .  If you or your partner has a chromosome problem that's causing the miscarriages, it is hard to say what your chances of having a healthy baby are if you just keep trying. Some problems are not passed on every time you conceive. Every couple is different, so you'll be referred to a doctor who specialises in genetic disorders for counselling (RCOG 2011, 2012) .  Some, but not all of the conditions that cause recurrent miscarriage are treatable (Newson 2013) . Your gynaecologist is the best person to ask about your chances of success. She won't be able to tell you for sure - nobody can. But she'll be able to take your medical history, your age, and test results into account when discussing your chances with you.  It can be very hard if you're feeling so knocked back by all your losses that you're not sure if you can face losing another baby. Having lots of support can help. Talk to close friends, family and your doctor about how you feel.  If you feel you want to try again for a baby, you may want to read our article about pregnancy after a miscarriage . Where can I get support? You can read our article on coping with miscarriage .  You'll also find plenty of support in the BabyCentre community from other women who've had the same experiences as you.  The charity, The Miscarriage Association , has further information.  If you do get pregnant again, you'll have extra support and appointments. This may be offered through
a clinic dedicated to recurrent and late miscarriage (RCOG 2012) , or an early pregnancy unit (EPU). Find out if there is an EPU in your area through the Early Pregnancy Information Centre . Each early pregnancy unit is run by a team of doctors, nurses, sonographers and support staff. They specialise in helping with problems in early pregnancy.

A BabyCentre Member  08/04/18    I'm currently going through my third miscarriage in 7 months. I already have three children (two from my previous marriage) , my partner and I desperately want a second child together. I should be 9 weeks today but we found out at an early scan two days ago that there was no heat beat. We have been hit by a double blow this time as we found out that we would have had twins. I'm 36 and concerned that my age is a factor and will continue to be as time passes by. Each loss gets harder to deal with, we are utterly heartbroken and it's hard in the here and now to keep hope that we will be able to one again experience the joy of another child.   Report this           A BabyCentre Member  05/02/18    Hello.
I lost another baby. Yes, another, my 8th. Am I guilty that I don't want to give up?   Report this           A BabyCentre Member  01/02/18    I have now had another MC, it happened last night. I also lost one in October I didn't know I had MC until I went for my 12 week scan, which was quite a shock. With this pregnancy I had some light bleeding at 5 weeks, went for a scan no heart beat but was told to come back the next week as it's normal for them not to see a heartbeat at 5 weeks.
I offered to take part in Tommy Miscarriage research at the EPU, so they scanned me again at 6 weeks, the heartbeat was there. I felt reassured! Next scan was in 2 weeks when I should of been 8 weeks but I had bleeding the day before so went to the EPU, I had miscarried.
I am 38, have has 4 babies with no problems, natural births no complications. This would of been my first child with my 2nd husband so I am left thinking is there something that is not compatible with me and him or is it because of my age.I would of thought the midwife would of seen me earlier due to the first MC but no they don't!!   Report this           A BabyCentre Member  21/01/18    Hi all, I've had 5 miscarriages (2 before I had my son who is now 21 months) and 2 just recently. I was told 2 weeks ago at my scan that my babies heart had stopped beating. I was 9 weeks along. All of them have been different and no one can explain why I had them. I carried my son over his due date and he was a healthy 9lb 14oz baby. I wanted to say to those of you who have experienced loss or those of you who are going through it, not to give up hope. My pregnancy with my son was a normal pregnancy with no complications and i had a natural birth which proves that every pregnancy is different. To the lady who posted on 21st Dec I know how you feel, its heart breaking and you feel so alone and that no one else understands. Have you talked to your doctor to see if they can do some tests? Maybe this could give you a bit of reassurance? Please try to stay positive , the next pregnancy could be the one!   Report this          A BabyCentre Member  21/12/17    Hello ladies, I wanted advise as im I dont feel happy anymore to live. Ive had 3 miscarrisges within two years and in my third year I had an ectopic pregnancy at middle of this year. Suprisingly I got pregnant just after 4 months after a succesful surgery to remove my right tube prior to the ectopic pregnancy.

Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks. (In medical articles, you may see the term "spontaneous abortion" used in place of miscarriage.) About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, and more than 80 percent of these losses happen before 12 weeks. This doesn't include situations in which you lose a fertilized egg before a pregnancy becomes established. Studies have found that 30 to 50 percent of fertilized eggs are lost before or during the process of implantation – often so early that a woman goes on to get her period at about the expected time.  Spotting the signs of a miscarriage If you have these signs of miscarriage, call your doctor or midwife right away so she can determine whether you have a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately: Bleeding or spotting.  Vaginal spotting or bleeding is usually the first sign of miscarriage. Keep in mind, though, that up to 1 in 4 pregnant women have some bleeding or spotting (finding spots of blood on your underpants or toilet tissue) in early pregnancy, and most of these pregnancies don't end in miscarriage. Abdominal pain. Abdominal pain usually begins after you first have some bleeding. It may feel crampy or persistent, mild or sharp, or may feel more like low back pain or pelvic pressure. When should I call my doctor with a pregnancy concern? There are some symptoms you should not ignore; call your doctor if you're pregnant and experiencing these symptoms. See all videos If you have both bleeding and pain, the chances of your pregnancy continuing are much lower. It's very important to be aware that vaginal bleeding, spotting, or pain in early pregnancy can also signal an ectopic or a molar pregnancy . Also, if your blood is Rh-negative , you may need a shot of Rh immune globulin within two or three days after you first notice bleeding, unless the baby's father is Rh-negative as well. Some miscarriages are first suspected during a routine prenatal visit, when the doctor or midwife can't hear the baby's heartbeat or notices that your uterus isn't growing as it should be. (Often the embryo or fetus stops developing a few weeks before you have symptoms like bleeding or cramping.) If your practitioner suspects that you've had a miscarriage, she'll order an ultrasound to see what's going on in your uterus. She may also do a blood test.  What causes a miscarriage Between 50 and 70 percent of first-trimester miscarriages are thought to be random events caused by chromosomal abnormalities in the fertilized egg. Most often, this means that the egg or sperm had the wrong number of chromosomes , and as a result, the fertilized egg can't develop normally. Sometimes a miscarriage is caused by problems that occur during the delicate process of early development. This would include an egg that doesn't implant properly in the uterus or an embryo with structural defects that prevent it from developing. Since most healthcare practitioners won't do a full-scale workup of a healthy woman after a single miscarriage, it's usually impossible to tell why the pregnancy was lost. And even when a detailed evaluation is performed – after you've had two or three consecutive miscarriages, for instance – the cause still remains unknown half the time. When the fertilized egg has chromosomal problems, you may end up with what's sometimes called a blighted ovum (now usually referred to in medical circles as an early pregnancy failure). In this case, the fertilized egg implants in the uterus and the placenta and gestational sac begin to develop, but the resulting embryo either stops developing very early or doesn't form at all. Because the placenta begins to secrete hormones, you'll get a positive pregnancy test and may have early pregnancy symptoms, but an ultrasound will show an empty gestational sac. In other cases, the embryo does develop for a little while but has abnormalities that make survival impossible, and development stops before the heart starts beating. If your baby has a normal heartbeat – usually first visible on ultrasound at around 6 weeks – and you have no symptoms like bleeding or cramping, your odds of having a miscarriage drop significantly and continue to decrease with each passing week.  What puts you at a higher risk for miscarriage Though any woman can miscarry, some are more likely to miscarry than others. Here are some risk factors: Age: Older women are more likely to conceive a baby with a chromosomal abnormality and to miscarry as a result. In fact, 40-year-olds are about twice as likely to miscarry as 20-year-olds. Your risk of miscarriage also rises with each child you bear. A history of miscarriages: Women who have had two or more miscarriages in a row are more likely than other women to miscarry again. Chronic diseases or disorders: Poorly controlled diabetes and certain inherited blood clotting disorders, autoimmune disorders (such as antiphospholipid syndrome or lupus ), and hormonal disorders (such as polycystic ovary syndrome) are some of the conditions that could increase the risk of miscarriage. Uterine or cervical problems: Having certain congenital uterine abnormalities, severe uterine adhesions (bands of scar tissue), or a weak or abnormally short cervix (known as cervical insufficiency) up the odds for a miscarriage. The link between uterine fibroids (a common, benign growth) and miscarriage is controversial, but most fibroids don't cause problems. A history of birth defects or genetic problems: If you, your partner, or family members have a genetic abnormality, have had one identified in a previous pregnancy, or have given birth to a child with a birth defect, you're at higher risk for miscarriage. Infections: Research has shown a somewhat higher risk for miscarriage if you have listeria , mumps, rubella , measles, cytomegalovirus , parvovirus, gonorrhea , HIV , and certain other infections. Smoking, drinking, and using drugs: Smoking, drinking alcohol , and using drugs like cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) during pregnancy can all increase your risk for miscarriage. Some studies show an association between high levels of caffeine consumption and an increased risk of miscarriage. Medications: Some medications have been linked to increased risk of miscarriage, so it's important to ask your caregiver about the safety of any medications you're taking, even while you're trying to conceive. This goes for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin . Environmental toxins: Environmental factors that might increase your risk include lead; arsenic; some chemicals, like formaldehyde, benzene, and ethylene oxide; and large doses of radiation or anesthetic gases. Paternal factors: Little is known about how the father's condition contributes to a couple's risk for miscarriage, though the risk does rise with the father's age. Researchers are studying the extent to which sperm could be damaged by environmental toxins but still manage to fertilize an egg. Some studies have found a greater risk of miscarriage when the father has been exposed to mercury, lead, and some industrial chemicals and pesticides. Obesity: Some studies show a link between obesity and miscarriage. Diagnostic procedures: There's a small increased risk of miscarriage after chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis , which may be performed for diagnostic genetic testing. Your risk of miscarriage is also higher if you get pregnant within three months after giving birth.  What to do if you think you might be having a miscarriage Call your doctor or midwife immediately if you ever notice unusual symptoms such as bleeding or cramping during pregnancy. Your practitioner will examine you to see if the bleeding is coming from your cervix and check your uterus. She may also do a blood test to check for the pregnancy hormone hCG and repeat it in two to three days to see if your levels are rising as they should be. If you're having bleeding or cramping and your practitioner has even the slightest suspicion that you have an ectopic pregnancy , you'll have an ultrasound right away. If there's no sign of a problem but you continue to spot, you'll have another ultrasound at about 7 weeks. At this point, if the sonographer sees an embryo with a normal heartbeat, you have a viable pregnancy and your risk of miscarrying is now much lower, but you'll need to have another ultrasound later if you continue to bleed. If the sonographer determines that the embryo is the appropriate size but there's no heartbeat, it means the embryo didn't survive. If the sac or the embryo is smaller than expected, the absence of a heartbeat might just mean that your dates are off and you're not as far along as you thought. Depending on the circumstances, you may need a repeat ultrasound within one to two weeks and some blood tests before your caregiver can make a final diagnosis. If you're in your second trimester and an ultrasound shows your cervix is shortening or opening , your doctor may decide to perform a procedure called cerclage, in which she stitches your cervix closed in an attempt to prevent miscarriage or premature delivery . (This is assuming your baby appears normal on the ultrasound and you have no signs of an intrauterine infection.) Cerclage isn't without risk, and not everyone agrees on what makes you a good candidate for it. If you're showing signs of a possible miscarriage, your doctor or midwife may prescribe bedrest in hopes of reducing your chances of miscarrying – but there's no evidence that bedrest will help. She may also suggest that you not have sex while you're having bleeding or cramping. Sex doesn't cause miscarriage, but it's a good idea to abstain if you're having these symptoms. You may have light bleeding and cramping for a few weeks. You can wear sanitary pads but no tampons during this time and take acetaminophen for the pain. If you are miscarrying, the bleeding and cramping will likely get worse shortly before you pass the "products of conception" – that is, the placenta and the embryonic or fetal tissue, which will look grayish and may include blood clots. If you can, save this tissue in a clean container. Your caregiver may want to examine it or send it to a lab for testing to try to find out why you miscarried. In any case, she'll want to see you again at this point, so call her to let her know what's happened.  What happens if you don't pass the tissue There are different ways of handling this, and it's a good idea to discuss the pros and cons of each with your caregiver. If there's no threat to your health, you may choose to wait and let the tissue pass on its own. (More than half of women spontaneously miscarry within a week of finding out that the pregnancy is no longer viable.) Or you may decide to wait a certain amount of time to see what happens before having a procedure to remove the tissue. In some cases, you can use medication to speed up the process, although there may be side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you choose to wait or take medication to try to speed it up, there's a chance you'll end up needing to have the tissue surgically removed anyway. On the other hand, if you find that it's too emotionally trying or physically painful to wait for the tissue to pass, you may decide to just have it removed. This is done by suction curettage or dilation and curettage (D&C). You'll definitely need to have the tissue removed right away if you have any problems that make it unsafe to wait, such as significant bleeding or signs of infection. And your practitioner may recommend the procedure if this is your second or third miscarriage in a row, so the tissue can be tested for a genetic cause.  Suction curettage and traditional D&C The procedure doesn't usually require an overnight stay unless you have complications. As with any surgery, you'll need to arrive with an empty stomach – no food or drink since the night before. Most obstetricians prefer to use suction curettage (or vacuum aspiration) because it's thought to be slightly quicker and safer than a traditional D&C, though some will use a combination of the two. For either procedure, the doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina, clean your cervix and vagina with an antiseptic solution, and dilate your cervix with narrow metal rods (unless your cervix is already dilated from having passed some tissue). In most cases, you'll be given sedation through an IV and a local anesthetic to numb your cervix. For suction curettage, the doctor will pass a hollow plastic tube through your cervix and suction out the tissue from your uterus. For a traditional D&C, she'll use a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette to gently scrape the tissue from the walls of your uterus. The whole thing may take about 15 to 20 minutes, though the tissue removal itself takes less than ten minutes. Finally, if your blood is Rh-negative , you'll receive a shot of Rh immune globulin unless the baby's father is Rh-negative, too.  What happens after a miscarriage Whether you pass the tissue on your own or have it removed, you'll have mild menstrual-like cramps afterward for up to a day or so and light bleeding for a week or two. Use pads instead of tampons and take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the cramps. Avoid sex, swimming, douching, and using vaginal medications for at least a couple of weeks and until your bleeding has stopped. If you begin to bleed heavily (soaking a sanitary pad in an hour), have any signs of infection (such as fever, achiness, or foul-smelling vaginal discharge), or feel excessive pain, call your practitioner immediately or go to the emergency room. If your bleeding is heavy and you begin to feel weak, dizzy, or lightheaded, you may be going into shock. In this case, call 911 right away – don't wait to hear from your caregiver, and don't drive yourself to the ER.  The chance of having another miscarriage It's understandable to be worried about the possibility of another miscarriage, but fertility experts don't consider a single early pregnancy loss to be a sign that there's anything wrong with you or your partner. Some practitioners will order special blood and genetic tests to try to find out what's going on after two miscarriages in a row, particularly if you're 35 or older or you have certain medical conditions. Others will wait until you've had three consecutive losses. In certain situations, such as if you had a second-trimester miscarriage or an early-third-trimester premature birth from a weakened cervix, you might be referred to a high-risk specialist after a single loss so your pregnancy can be carefully managed.  Conceiving again after a miscarriage You may have to wait a bit. Whether you miscarry spontaneously, with the help of medication, or have the tissue removed, you'll generally get your period again in four to six weeks. Some practitioners say you can start trying to conceive again after this period, but others recommend that you wait until you've been through another menstrual cycle so that you have more time to recover physically and emotionally. (You'll need to use birth control to prevent conception during this time, because you may ovulate as early as two weeks after you miscarry.)  How to cope after a miscarriage Though you may be physically ready to get pregnant again, you may not feel ready emotionally. Some women cope best by turning their attention toward trying for a new pregnancy as soon as possible. Others find that months or more go by before they're ready to try to conceive again.

And that's highly unlikely to happen again. It could, but it's most likely you'll be able to carry another child to term. Unless, the father of the other 3 isn't the father of the new one you're TTC. In that case, there could be another problem. But really, you should keep trying and you'll probably do great! GL.    --  Mama to two sweet little bear cubs.

He did tell me the whole 80% thing as well.  Also- if you look at other posts that I did I was told of other tests you can have done to beater help your changes of finding out why you might MC.  Basic routine blood tests so I am going to do them.  I just do not think I can handle another MC  (miscarriage) but I know that I cannot "not" try again.  Good Luck!    --  - Michelle (wife to Jeff) mom to Samantha 11/17/05 and Madison 4/7/10 (after 2 MC's & 2 yrs of TTC)             Reply            Report this comment        1                     kim in Iowa    Posted 01/31/2009      I have some questions what does A/F mean and dpo mean?  The post I read have some abbreviations, I do not know what they mean??

04/15/2017  I'm not sure of the stats but after my first Mmc my dr told me "the odds of it happening again are so low. I rarely see a lady miscarriage twice in a row, unless there is other health issues going on" (at the time I had 3 children and no known health issues) that made me optimistic but unfortunately I had a second Mmc right after. We went on to have testing and found out what was causing them. Anyway- according to my dr your odds are good if you have no health issues!      What caused it?

I had a blighted ovum in January and found out at the 8 week ultrasound. Waited 2 more weeks and nothing had changed so went ahead with D and C. I found out I'm pregnant again with no period on March 15th. Had my first ultrasound on April 11th and saw a sac with yolk sac with "possible" fetal pole. No hb yet. My doctor doesn't seem worried at all and I'm wondering how 4 weeks after a positive I'm dating 6 weeks. Hoping it's not another mmc. If anyone knows if there is a way to know why it happens please tell!

04/15/2017  What caused it?      Mine were most likely caused because I have a chromosome abnormality. It doesn't effect me but can be passed to future babies. I also have MTHFR. Which can cause clotting issues and makes my body not processs folic acid the way it should.

I have seen a lot of women posting statistics which are all very accurate; however, someone out there represents a number in those stats and I for one am one of those. I miscarried twice in a row with absolutely no medical reasonings as to why. I am considered very healthy and unless there is something deeper going on that my doctor has yet to discover then I was just one of the unfortunate few that went thru this twice. As a matter of fact they were 3 months apart. I fell pregnant after both, the second one ending me up here at 9 weeks tomorrow (let me add this is the furthest mine have ever gotten). I say this to you because sometimes our body's know when something is wrong before we do and they do exactly what they are designed to do and expel most likely a fetus that was never sustainable for life. (I'm a nurse as well, so please don't take my words as being thoughtless and harsh). My point is none of us know what tomorrow holds and that's the scary part, but try to commemorate this pregnancy as your second chance at being a mama (even though you'll always be one- your first precious baby just has a set of angel wings). Your breasts are sore- yay! Hold on to that symptom because that's something! stay positive and try not to stress yourself out.. you and your baby need a sense of peace during this time. So when you find yourself getting stressed, find something to take your mind off it! My point is don't stress about the chances, instead focus on the now and find peace for you and that baby of yours!

As a matter of fact they were 3 months apart. I fell pregnant after both, the second one ending me up here at 9 weeks tomorrow (let me add this is the furthest mine have ever gotten). I say this to you because sometimes our body's know when something is wrong before we do and they do exactly what they are designed to do and expel most likely a fetus that was never sustainable for life. (I'm a nurse as well, so please don't take my words as being thoughtless and harsh). My point is none of us know what tomorrow holds and that's the scary part, but try to commemorate this pregnancy as your second chance at being a mama (even though you'll always be one- your first precious baby just has a set of angel wings). Your breasts are sore- yay! Hold on to that symptom because that's something! stay positive and try not to stress yourself out.. you and your baby need a sense of peace during this time. So when you find yourself getting stressed, find something to take your mind off it! My point is don't stress about the chances, instead focus on the now and find peace for you and that baby of yours!

So it looks like another mmc. I have one child and before her I had 2 Mc early before 6 weeks. You can never tell because I still have sore boobs and still feel very pregnant unfortunately that's why mmc are so hard to detect. We did an us to check only because I pushed because I just had a feeling               Reply            Report this comment        1                     sonriso1    Posted 04/17/2017       CalenLC said:    Hey sweet mama!

04/15/2017  Hey sweet mama! I have seen a lot of women posting statistics which are all very accurate; however, someone out there represents a number in those stats and I for one am one of those.

Started bleeding today and went straight for a second ultrasound showing no growth from last week😭 I have no know. Health issues that would cause this. Never thought I would be in this situation ever.               Reply            Report this comment       0               / 3      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Right now, I'm awaiting my second mmc at 9 weeks or so as the heartbeat had stopped either Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. We had saw and heard it last Thursday and Friday. I have no living children. What are my chances of actually being successful third try? I know there's no medical advice anyone can give, but I just need to hear from other women who have had a similar experience. I don't get why I've had two losses in 7 months all at 9 weeks. So heartbreaking.  Just trying to make sense of this,           See all comments from original poster (5)  Hide all comments from original poster (5)      Load more            Comment            Report this post        7          Comments (19)        / 2                   SnnysAngl03    Posted 07/19/2014      Im so sorry...

I've had 3 MC's now and I'm down to a 60% chance. My ob told me the same "you have every reason to believe" statement that Natasha said, but when asked for statistics, my re is pretty open and told me.  That being said, a 75% chance is pretty dang good. I wouldn't worry yet. Good luck!

I figured 'ok, first time, it happens' now, the second time in a row...What's wrong?! This time around, the doctor did mention the pregnancy being a mono-mono twin pregnancy and only one baby made it to having a heartbeat and the other was in the process of being reabsorbed. I guess, that's my way of thinking this pregnancy was unusual. So, I may have a better chance next time if it's just one baby. Just hopeful thinking and rationalizing. Thanks again.

This time, I haven't had any hormone testing. I asked my doctor about it and she said with me making it this far she does not believe there is a hormone imbalance. She said she would've figured I would have spotted prior if it were hormones. She said I can get testing if I want, so when I get home, that's what I'll request. She also told me progesterone has to do with the luteal phase and such and does not occur as often as people may think. I don't know. My luteal phase is normally 12 days, so I've never had any issues. Each time we tried to get pregnant, we did.

Its my 'miracle' it is a miracle drug. they would not be here if it werent for prometrium. It doesnt hurt you or baby so I dont know why she wouldnt give anyways.

When I had the D&C; done, I was alreay producing colostrum.  I had my horomone levels checked- they looked great at 4.5 weeks.  My first ultrasound/heartbeat appt is Monday and my husband is coming to support me.  The only way I'm making it through is pretending I'm not pregnant, which is hard when I am constantly fatigued, having major food aversions, and sometimes suffering terrible morning sickness.  I know that 1 in 100 pregnancies end in a missed miscarriage and there is only a 2% chance of two miscarriages in a row, but I can't shake the cynical attitude and I hate it.  I feel like, "Why should I be happy when the baby is going to die soon anyway?"  Does anyone feel the way I do?  To make matters worse, I have MRSA, which could lead to a staph infection if it's not effectively treated.  Could this hurt the fetus?  How do I stay positive in the midst of everything?     --  DD born 02/19/08 Angel baby March 2010 (9.5 weeks) New baby is due October 29th        See all comments from original poster (3)  Hide all comments from original poster (3)      Load more            Comment            Report this post         8          Comments (26)        / 3                   EDM1984    Posted 03/14/2011      I understand what you are going through. This is my second pregnancy. I m/c back in Dec. So many people I have known have had this carefree pregnancy where they just sit back and enjoy it and all I want is to be at the end of my 1st trimester so I can maybe breathe a sigh of relief. I had my first dr appt today and even though everything checked out fine I'm still sitting here wondering. My hubby and I are actually looking into how much an u/s would be since my insurance only covers one and we still want one between 18-22 wks so we can find out the sex of the baby. We just need that reassurance that they are truly there. Hang in there. I'm sure that it will get better for the both of us.    --  Liz Happily Married to my sweetheart 10/12/2008 Loving Mommy to Marie Elizabeth 10/17/2011             Reply            Report this comment        2                     dolphin_509    Posted 03/15/2011      I had a missed m/c in dec of 09 after seeign the HB at 10weeks and when I got pregnant again I felt the same way.  When I went for my 1st u/s at 7weeks I was sure there would be something wrong, but the baby looked great.  Then I had an appt at 10 weeks to hear the HB and I had a panic attack in the waitin room, but again everything was fine.  After I heard the HB again at 14 weeks I started to feel a little better about the pregnancy and my midwife ordered an u/s at 18w and we saw our little man.  I do not think I ever stopped owrring that something would go wrong and that I would loose this baby too.  But now I have a healthy happy little 2 month old.  I wish you the best and hang in there I can;t really say the worring goes away but try to relax and enjoy the pregnancy.    --  Maureen(31) DH-Chad(34)= DD-Adeline Rose(5/14/06) ^Angel Baby^ 12/22/09& Our  R A I N B O W Jack Eward 1/11/11.

Went to my 1st prenatal appointment only to be told the baby had no HB.   The 2nd I heard the healthy hb at 6 weeks.  Only to find out at 10.5 weeks baby stopped growing just a few days after I heard the HB.  I had a d&c; for both miscarriages...and was ready to just quit.  But I tried one more time for DH.  Got pregnant again in November 2009.  I was a ball of nerves the WHOLE time.  I did not enjoy one minute of my pregnancy.  However I do have my rainbow baby boy who just turned 7 months last week. He was born VERY healthy and happy!    Your right you will never have a care-free pregnancy again.  Sadly a loss or losses take away the joys of pregnancy. Try to make every day special, and try to relax (I know how hard that is- trust me I do).  I kept waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under me my whole pregnancy; my BP would go up before every dr. appointment, I would cry myself to sleep due to worry....but what I realize now is I robbed myself of the joys!   I can't go back and change time but I can tell my story to ladies like you....I really hope you can relax and enjoy cause really there is nothing more you can do but take care of U.  CONGRATS!!  All my best and please keep me posted.    --  Dolores (37) DH (38) Roy; 5/17/2008 DS (17) Brandon 5/16/94- Missed M/C: 3/09 and 7/09 Mason Alexander; August 7, 2010 @ 2:37am  8pds 9oz (Perfect)!

The only difference is that I am 39 years old and I tend to blame my losses on the chromosomal abnormalities associated with age. I lost the first one last June at 6w2d due to trisomy 16. (An extra chromosome being introduced at the time of conception) and a recent loss in January that was an empty sac/blighted ovum. That one totally blew me away because I felt pregnant in every way. It wasn't until I hit 6 1/2 weeks that I sensed something was wrong. I had a few days of diarrhea and it made me nervous. That was on a Wednesday and I had already begun to miscarry that Friday.  By sme miraculous miracle I got pregnant almost immediately again. This was with a large cyst on my right ovary that was later determine to be a failed ovulation. I was wondering why it appeared that I had ovulated, but never got an AF  (Aunt Flo - menstruation/period) two weeks later at all. The pain of it sent me to my doctor who confirmed it. Again, this was on a Wednesday and then I ended up successfully O-ing just 2 days later! DH  (dear husband) and I just decided to go for it and we got pregnant!  I went to my first sono at 5 weeks 4 days and all we saw was the sac and yolksac. The baby was too small at that stage to see. But the doctor seemed to think I was right on track with my own estimations. I am in that horrible stage of waiting myself... my next sono won't be until Monday at 7 weeks 2 days. I won't deny that I am positively dying here. Watching every symptom... nervous when I lose a few... my soar breasts have returned, but aren't nearly as soar as they had been. And my nausea is less severe this week. But I am trying not to worry too much.  I can't agree with you more Teachercoachmom... I try not to view it as a live pregnancy either. I am so afraid of being let down again. This is my last chance due to my age alone. Getting DH  (dear husband) to go along with trying a second time was hard enough. But a third time was a complete miracle. This was not expected, but I sure do hope this is the one!  I wish all of you ladies the very best with all of your pregnancies! Please keep us posted here!!! The support would be so great right about now!!!    --  Eileen(42)Joe(41)DD(19)DS(16)DS(13)DD(6)4 angels 3/91, 6/10, 1/11 &3/11.

And now I almost feel more invested in the pregnancy and a little more vulnerable.  It does make me feel a bit cheated.  I with I could be more excited.    --  ~Waylon James is here!!!~             Reply            Report this comment        3                     Savedmom25    Posted 03/20/2011      I had a miscarriage on March 7th even though the baby died 2 weeks prior is what the doctor told me.

One more week and this baby surpasses how long the last one lived.  I think I will finally relax and "bond" once I get out of the "1st Trimester Danger Zone". Just one more month to "wait it out".  It's going to be a really long month.

Not good... sorry ladies.This will be my 3rd loss in 9 months. I am the exception to the rule because of my age though. So please to all of you young ladies, don't ever lose hope.  My sono showed a babe 6 weeks 1 or 2 days... no HB. I am 7 weeks 2 days without a doubt. I know when I got my first positive test and had bloodwork drawn the same day. They are running my HCG right now. And Progesterone levels. But I know they will either come back in normal range and won't show a drop until they have something to compare it up against. They should repest the draw in 48 hrs. just to be sure. But I know in my gutt that this little one was doomed from the beginning. None of mine have had HB's. I am 4 for 4. I have 4 healthy kids and have had 4 losses. 3 of which I had in less than 9 months time. DH  (dear husband) and I have just the 1 child together and she was apparently a complete miracle. I need to change my views and look at it that way and be grateful for what I do have.  To all of you, please stay strong and don't ever give up.

I've also found it much easier to deal with emotionally to just assume that it's not going to "take." But it is *so* annoying to have the pregnancy symptoms and be modifying my behavior on one hand while assuming it's not real on the other.  Friends who I've told-- who know about the m/c (dec '10 for me)-- are so optimistic and don't seem to understand my attitude.  But the scary thing is I've found myself not wanting this pregnancy to last. I already have 2 kids and I'm suddenly freaked out about whether it was a good decision to try for 3.  I wanted to so badly and now feel like I'm in a completely different place- happy with my family as it is. I don't know if that's a reaction to assuming it won't work out, so I'll feel more positive about it if it does work out.

I had a missed miscarriage this time last year and I was wondering if anyone knew what the likelyhood of me having another one is?  They say miscarriages happen all the time, but could my luck really be that bad that it would happen to me two times in a row?  I'm so stressed about it that I can't sleep, which I can't imagine is good for the little one.  Any advice or words of encouragement you can give would help me greatly.  Also, I am 6wks 3 days.

Any kind of mc is bad, but last time I found out I'd been walking around for weeks with a non viable fetus just sitting there inside me.

I go to the doctor on Thursday but it's just to see the nurse to get my info and pee in a cup, etc. Do you think they'll do an u/s sooner than last time because of the mmc?    --  Lillian Grace August 2010 Cannon Wade March 2013             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Zinjan    Posted 12/28/2009      For the pregnancy after your first MC  (miscarriage) I think that your chance of MC  (miscarriage) only goes up a % or two.

Then the second one I had no clue cause i still had all my symptons like you. Now this one I am trying to be optismic even though I have seen spotting the last two days and first thing tomorrow morning I am going to the ER and hope they give me some good news. Hope we all have a safe and happy pregnancy. Try not to stress I know it's hard to do but at least we have the fact that we can get pregnant and god forbid something happens we can try again.

Like pp said, ask your doctor for an early u/s-hopefully he or she will let you have one.

While it can be disheartening, it should be good known that, even after having two miscarriages in a row, you have a good chance of going on to have a normal pregnancy that eventually leads to a healthy, happy baby. How many women have miscarriages? The chances of having a miscarriage can be as high as forty percent.  Almost 1 percent of all women will have more than 2-3 miscarriages in a row.  While having this many pregnancy losses can be frustrating, the worst part is that, most of the time, the doctor will be unable to tell you why this has occurred.  There are certain things that can result in recurrent miscarriages and some of these things can involve something you can control in the future. Causes of Recurrent Miscarriage Many women who have recurrent miscarriage want to know what is going on and if there is anything they can do to keep this from happening again.  Even if no cause is found for the recurrent miscarriage, you may still go on to have a healthy baby the next time around.   Even so, it is important to know the possible reasons why you are having 2 miscarriages in a row as there may be a cause that can be treated that will lead to a healthy pregnancy if you decide to try again.  The main causes of recurrent miscarriage are generally quite rare and include the following: There can be a hormonal problem such as is seen in gynecological disease like polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition where there are many cysts on the ovaries, leading to an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage. Having bacterial vaginosis, which is when you have a bacterial infection of the vaginal tissues. It is associated with recurrent miscarriages. Having a genetic problem. This means that either the mother or father has a chromosomal abnormality that leads to recurrent miscarriages.  The chances of this are 2-5 percent of couples. Having thrombophilia, a condition where there are too many platelets in the system and your chances of having a blood clot is higher than average as is your chances of having a miscarriage. Having antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which also called Hughes syndrome. APS occurs in 15-20 percent of cases of recurrent miscarriage.  There Is also a risk of blood clots in and outside of the pregnancy. Increased age. Women over the age of 35 years have an increased risk of having a miscarriage.  Men over the age of 40 also can yield a pregnancy that ends in miscarriage. Having more than one previous miscarriage increases the odds that your next pregnancy will also end in miscarriage. Remember that these are uncommon conditions and that most of the time, no cause can be found as to why you are having recurrent miscarriage. Tests and Treatment for Recurrent Miscarriages Once you have had at least 2 miscarriages in a row, your family practice doctor or midwife should have you see an obstetrical/gynecological specialist for testing to see why this problem is recurrent.  Tests you should expect includes the following: Testing for antiphospholipid syndrome—this is a test that looks for antibodies to phospholipids in your system. Often it takes more than one test to see if this is the problem or not.  If the test shows antiphospholipid syndrome, there are things you can do that can prevent a future miscarriage. Testing for chromosomal abnormalities—this is also known as karyotyping. This is when both the man and the woman is tested to see if they have any genetic cause for the disease. If this test shows a problem, a genetic counselor may be required, who will help you decide whether or not you will have a healthy baby in the future. Testing for chromosome problems in the fetus—this means testing the fetal tissue for genetic testing rather than testing each parent. Testing for infection—if an infection is detected and treated, you should have a normal pregnancy the next time around. Ultrasound testing—in this case, the ultrasound is looking for abnormalities in the size or shape of the uterus. Some uterine abnormalities can be surgically managed so that you can have a normal pregnancy in the future.  An ultrasound can also diagnose a shortening or weakness of the cervix as a cause of recurrent miscarriage.  If this is the case, you may have to have a uterine cerclage during your next pregnancy, which will keep the cervix from dilating prematurely. Chances of having a Normal Pregnancy in the Future If no known cause can be found as to why you have had 2-3 miscarriages in a row, you have a decent chance of having a healthy baby the next time around.  You can be checked out by an early pregnancy unit team (EPU team), which will provide close care for you once you become pregnant again.  About 75 percent of women with recurrent pregnancies that are unable to be explained will go on to have a healthy pregnancy in the future. If the problem is something related to chromosomal abnormalities, your chances of having a healthy pregnancy the next time around depends on what type of chromosomal abnormality is found.  Some chromosome abnormalities don’t show up in every pregnancy so there is every reason to suspect that a normal pregnancy is in the future.  You just need to continue to try again. Remember that some causes of recurrent miscarriage are preventable the next time you try to become pregnant.  This is why you should see an OB/GYN doctor, who is familiar with recurrent miscarriages and who will be able to find out why you are having so many miscarriages in a row and may be able to treat some of these causes of recurrent miscarriage. Support for Recurrent Miscarriage If you have had 2-3 miscarriages in a row, you may wish to join a forum in which other women have had similar experiences. There you can find support for your problem and can meet up electronically with other women who have suffered from the same problem and can provide you with tips for a healthy pregnancy the next time or can simply offer support and compassion for what you are going through.

Does a past miscarriage increase the chances of it happening again?   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Q: I had a miscarriage during my last pregnancy. What are the chances of it happening again? A: Miscarriage is a devastating, but very common, pregnancy occurrence. You should know that most women (more than 85 percent) who miscarry are able to get pregnant again and give birth to healthy babies. Since most miscarriages occur totally randomly, having one does not increase your risk of experiencing a subsequent pregnancy loss. Your chance of miscarrying again is about the same as that of any other mom-to-be -- about 15 percent for most women under 35 (miscarriage risk increases with maternal age). But even after two miscarriages, your risk of having a third only goes up slightly -- and many doctors won't start testing for health conditions that affect miscarriage (like uterine problems, hormone imbalances, or chronic medical conditions) until after you've had two or three. Research shows that nearly 75 percent of women who've had three miscarriages in a row -- rare as that is -- go on to have healthy pregnancies and babies.

I had (if you have a weak stomach, I'd stop ready, because what I'm going to say may be disgusting) a real heavy period the 1st day.. I wore a tampon to be and when I woke up, there was like a 3 inch blooding clump.. (sorry I told ya, it was going to be disgustin) So I don't know if I had a miscarriage or not. What do you think? And also what are the chances of me having another miscarriage next pregnancy??                Loading...

Reply                 Loading...             xHariiex123991  over a year ago    I have been with my fiancee for a few years now and just over one year ago we decided to try for a baby. nothing happened for the first six months however in december i fell pregnant, and on the 25th of January i miscarried. I have honestly never know any pain like it. We were both so happy because although we were only trying for six months it felt like a life time!!! especially as some people only have to have intercourse once and they fall pregnant. Around about the same time my friend fell pregnant but she decided to have an abortion. It is probably the most horrible thing to say but i really did and still do wish our situations were swapped over. We really wanted our baby. The emotional pain that accompanies a miscarrige is ridiculous. Our relationship took a turn for the worst because i wanted to talk about our loss because we had built dreams in the month that i was pregnant and spoke about general baby things as you would then our dream was snatched as well as our babys life. Although i wanted to talk about our loss my partner didnt. he used to make jokes about it as a way to deal with it, which was very hurtful on my part although i understood. eventually we spoke about it and he broke down and now we are on the road to recovery and are learning to deal with our loss. Then in April i was 2 weeks late on my period. i didnt want to take a test incase of putting bad luck on it. Sounds silly. But then i had almost the same symtoms as i did in january so i think i may have miscarried again. Then in July i found i was pregnant again however miscarried again...yes again, a few weeks into my pregnancy. We are both absolutely devestated and all we want is a baby. Never realised it would take this long. The emotional strain this has put us under is rather bad. I keep looking on websites to try and justify my miscarriges but nothing as yet has helped. So now...Mid september i am currently ovulating...fingers crossed. I know that sperm can stay inside a woman for up to seven days and that having intercourse in the seven days leading up to ovulation and during can increase your chances of getting pregnant. I am mid ovulation and today i woke up and was sick. I have been sick about 3 times today and also felt unwell yestoday and had a headache and back pain and have not been able to keep any food down and feel sick at the sight of food. Do you think there is a possiblity of another pregnancy?? I think about being pregnant every single day and we want nothing more than to have a baby. The more i want it the less it seems to happen. Do you think i should make an appointment with my gp and speak to him about the miscarriges? It sounds so silly but i have been putting it off because i feel ashamed...it was my baby and i failed to keep it safe. Maybe if i had done something different my baby would be here within the next month. Any advice would be greatly apreciated. Thank you.

Can you tell me if there's anything else healthwise I'd need to know about?     Reply                 Loading...             xHariiex123991  over a year ago    There is no other condition that i believe could affect my pregnancies. I do have a curved spine but as far as i know and have been informed this is not a risk factor in a pregnancy. Everything thing else is as it should be...or as far as i know.     Reply                 Loading...             bluedog114369  over a year ago    My understanding of the situation (and I know this sounds odd) is that you would have to have at least four miscarriages before they would consider the possibility that there is some sort of underlying condition. Have ou been checked for PCOS? That is usually a pretty common condition that affects your ability to get pregnant.     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    Have you checked if you are positive blood type and he is negative? Because when i miscarried it was one of the first things they asked. Your body can reject the baby if you guys have opposite blood type. There is a shot for it, to get rid of the chances of that happening.     Reply                 Loading...

I've had two miscarriages in a row now. The first was in Feb 2010 at about 11.5 weeks (although the baby stopped developing around 6.5 weeks we found out). The second was in early August this year as well and I was 5.5 weeks. I don't have any children yet. I'm 26 and healthy as far as I know. I have an appt tomorrow with a fertility specialist and I'm feeling nervous about it. I'm worried I'll never have a child, that something major is wrong with me. And I'm scared to get pregnant again. Going through those miscarriages was the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. To make it worse, I recently threw a baby shower for my sister and she had the baby less than a week ago, and it seems like everyone I know is pregnant right now. Oh well, I guess that's just how it is, and everything always seems worse at night anyway... Thank you for reading. I feel a little better already getting that off my chest. Tammy Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  16 Posts t  tomest obviously I haven't posted in awhile, my ticker still says I'm pregnant... L  Liz1219 I'm so sorry for your losses. I found this board when I had my loss 2 weeks ago and it really helps the grieving process. I wish you the best in the future. T  TBMomma23 @tomest  I am so sorry to hear what you are going through, i totally understand.  I had an m/c in May and just had a d&c last Friday.  Both times the baby stopped developing around 7 weeks and both times I had to have a d&c.  I am 35 so they have tested the babies both times - the first was trisomy 13 and we are still waiting for the results on this one.  My husband and I just had chromosonal testing and once we get the results from everything I am hoping that we will have a much more clear direction of what we can do.  I do know that I only waited one cycle between the two and even though I don't want to wait - I feel like that is probably best for my body to rest at least a few more cycles. I wish you the best of luck and maybe they will find it is something relatively easy to solvesuch as giving progesterone.  Sorry I don't have nay answers but sometimes its nice to know your not alone.  It also helps me to hear stories where the 3rd time is a charm :) t  tomest Thank you for the encouragement. I really just want to figure out what is wrong with me! d  dhearne @tomest  Tammy: I know exactly what you are going through.  I had my first mc at 5.5 weeks in April and my second mc at 11 weeks a few weeks ago. I am 26 with no children.  It does seem like everyone is pregnant right now, but I think I just notice more now.  I am interested to see how your appointment with the specialist goes.  I insisted on testing from my doctor, and I couldn't get in to see the specialist for testing until November.  If you can, will you let me know how the appointment goes?  I am nervous about it as well, but I've tried not to think too much about it.  I too am worried that there is something wrong with me.  I've done some research and it seems to me that most of the causes of recurrent miscarriage are pretty treatable and that most people go on to have a baby.  I try to think about that and hope that if there is something wrong it's treatable.  I don't think I really helped too much.  Just know that you are not alone! -Danielle t  thevioletfemme @tomest  I'm with you, and so sorry for your loss:( I had my first end of may, and my second 1st of sept. 3 months apart mc's:( My dr won't refer me to a specialist until at least 1 more MC which i pray doesn't happen, so please tell me what happens, I'm really upset that I feel like there's nothing i can do right now to try and prevent another one.  t  tomest @thevioletfemme  I'm sorry for your losses as well. I hope the third time works out for you so you don't have to go through that heartbreak again. Why don't you go see a specialist on your own? Or do you need the referral for insurance purposes? Good luck this next time around. Let me know if you need to talk (my email address is above). Tammy d  dhearne @thevioletfemme  I just wanted to tell you that my doctor didn't want to do any testing, but I insisted.  He gave me "your young, you can try again" and "sometimes these things just happen" speaches.  I told him I needed to do it for my peace of mind not just for medical reasons.  After a few conversations I was able to get him to refer me to the specialist.  I agree with Tammy if your insurance will allow it I would try to get your own appointment with a specialist.  That was my plan before I talked the doctor into testing. d  dhearne @tomest  Wow...that's a lot of stuff.  I can see how it could be overwhelming.  It sounds like I will have plenty to focus on once the testing gets started so that's good.  Don't feel like an idiot about the crying...I cry all the time now!  I cried in the doctor's office saying the word miscarriage trying to convince him to give me the referral.  Please keep me posted.  It would be nice to have someone to talk to that's going through the same thing.  I hope you are able to find answers.  Thanks for letting me know about your appointment.  Good Luck! -  @tomest  Tammy- I just want to try to give you a little hope. I went through the same thing.... two super early losses with no explanation. I was 24 for both losses with no known health problems. I had blood tests and an HSG after the second loss, and they couldn't find anything to explain the problems. I was terrified to try again, but DH and I just decided to rip the bandaid off and take a leap of faith. I am writing this today 23 weeks pregnant with a perfectly healthy little boy- have had no complications to date, and he is actually measuring 4 days ahead. You may find after testing that there is something they can do to help you stay pregnant, but that was not the case for me. It was so frustrating to be told it was simply "bad luck" rather than them telling me there was something they could DO. But for us, the third time really was the charm. I know this is SO much easier said than done, but try not to give up hope. -Sarah s  shera182201 @thevioletfemme  I am so sorry you're going through this.  Medical care should be about working together to do what's best for you, not just what seems to cover everybody else.  If your doctor refuses to refer you, I'd say get another doctor!  In the meantime, there are things you could do to help prevent another one.  I am not a doctor, and I certainly don't know if there could be medical reasons for you not to follow these suggestions, but here they are anyway: you could take a daily baby aspirin, and in addition to continuing to take your prenatal vitamins, you could also take extra folic acid, like an extra 400mg.  It doesn't sound like much, but at least it's proactive.  Chances are your miscarriages truly are just bad luck, but wouldn't it be better to rule out everything else??  Stick to your guns! t  tomest So I posted this thread a while ago and I'm not sure if anyone is still interested, but I thought I'd give an update. I've been to many many appts with my fertility dr. He said he doesn't think the 2 m/c's were related. I had tons of bloodwork done. Everything looks normal, but they still have me taking an extra 400 mcg of folic acid twice daily, plus 81 mg of aspirin in addition to prenatal vitamins. I told the doc it didn't make sense to me since the bloodwork was normal, but he said it won't hurt and why not give the next baby every chance to make it, so I agreed to keep taking it. I also had a hysterpscopy that showed a slight uterine septum so they fixed that. They said this could have been the cause of m/c. Also further bloodwork and u/s showed that I ovulate late and hence my progesterone is a little low, so that could also cause m/c. The dr put me on Clomid this month in order to manipulate my ovulation and hormone levels (he assured me it's not because of lack of ovulation or anything). So this month we are trying to conceive...and I'm so scared to let myself get too excited. I am trying to take it one day at a time. I'm not desparate to be pregnant at this exact moment, but I feel like I need to try now while the dr is monitoring me. I don't want to risk another m/c if I can avoid it. I know I could still m/c again but I'm trying not to think about it. I think sometimes I'm in denial that there's anything wrong with me. Sometimes I still feel like "why am I putting myself through all this? I could have had bad luck twice and I could have a perfectly normal pregnancy next time" but then I remember how hard it was to go through those m/c and I'm glad I'm doing it this way. Who wouldn't want to have everything happen naturally and be surprised, etc? That's just not my reality at this point! Haha. Anyway, I'm thinking positive and hopefully I'll have good news soon! If not, there's always next month! Thanks for reading, Tammy S  StephMB @tomest  Tammy - It sounds like you've been through alot. Good for you trying again! I really hope it works AND sticks. Keep me posted! Stephanie l  liz09storn @tomest  Thanks so much for posting! Â I just found out that we lost our 2nd pregnancy on Friday - the baby only measured 6wk2d, which was the same that it had measured 2 weeks before. We lost our first at the end of April - again I was nearly 9 weeks and the baby measured less than 6. Â I'll be getting testing in about a month or so, so it was really helpful to hear what you went through.Â Good luck! Â Your positive attitude will get you really far :-) -Liz  t  tomest Thanks ladies, I'll keep you posted! Liz- I'm so sorry for your losses. But you never have to feel like you're alone, that's why I love these boards...there's always someone who knows what you're going through! (although I do wish there weren't quite so many of us who knew the pain of m/c) Good luck with your testing next month and let me know how it goes!

Will I have a third?     2005-05-26T21:17:34.000Z  By Dr. Judith Reichman   TODAY               Popular on TODAY.com     Seth Meyers reveals baby son was born in the lobby of his apartment building    Canadian bus crash mourners suffer new tragedy: Mix-up in victim's identity    Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson have the best response to poll comparing them    Amal Clooney opens up about falling for George, reveals twins' first word    PetSmart facing allegations of mistreatment after dog deaths                share     tweet     email     Q: I’m in my late 20s. I’ve had two miscarriages and I’m so afraid of having another one if I try again. What should I do?   A: Let me start with an encouraging piece of information: the odds are that you won’t. Your two miscarriages might have simply been due to chance.  The “usual” risk for miscarrying a pregnancy in your 20s is 15 percent. If you’re younger than 30 and have had three miscarriages — and especially if you’ve had no living births — your chance of having this recur is about 25 percent.  If you’ve had four miscarriages, your condition is now categorized as recurrent pregnancy loss, or RPL, and your risk does go up to about 40 percent.  For women over 30, the picture is different — these numbers do increase with age.  In order to understand why pregnancies fail, lets first look at what is required for a successful pregnancy (aside from the requisite sperm meeting an egg):  A normally developed uterus that allows for implantation and growth Adequate hormonal support Immunologic acceptance (the immune system doesn’t attempt to expel the fetus as an unwanted foreign object) A normal fetus with genetic material compatible for development A sterile uterine environment devoid of toxic substances  Now let’s look at when, why and how often one of these prerequisites goes bad. Fifty percent of women who have RPL have some type of anatomic uterine problem that interferes with implantation and growth of a pregnancy such as:  The development of only one horn of the uterus (a unicornuate uterus) The failure of the two halves of the uterus to meet during development (a didelphic uterus) The failure of the halves to meet completely (a bicornuate uterus) The development of a wedge shaped septum in the uterine cavity  There can also be developmental or trauma-caused deformations of the cervix which contribute to miscarriage:  Incompetent cervix. The cervix is short, weak or partially open so that it dilates from the pressure of the growing pregnancy; the membranes then prematurely rupture and a second trimester miscarriage results. Occasionally, scarring of the uterine lining (from a D&C or a past infection) prevents appropriate growth of the fetus. In this case, pregnancy doesn’t occur at all or, once started, does not develop and aborts.   Hormonal issues Another very common cause for early RPLs (15 percent or more) is hormonal inadequacy. The amount of progesterone produced after ovulation may not be sufficient to keep the lining of the uterus built up so that it can support the pregnancy. It begins to slough and the pregnancy is lost. This occurs more frequently in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (symptoms of which include irregular periods, weight gain, excess hair growth and acne).  Up to 60 percent of very early miscarriages (before 10 weeks gestation) are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. When pregnancy occurs, half of the chromosomes come from the mother’s egg and the other half from her partner’s sperm. They have to match up and keep their information straight in order for the pregnancy to develop. If there is a lapse of genetic completion, the pregnancy can’t develop and eventually is expelled.  This poor pregnancy outcome usually is not correlated with an abnormality in your or your partner’s genetic makeup; it occurs by chance during chromosomal partnering — a transaction so complicated that it’s amazing that it turns out right in the majority of pregnancies. However, if it happens with three or more pregnancies and tests of the products of conception show specific chromosomal abnormalities, there is a 3 to 6 percent chance that an abnormality in your or your partner’s chromosomes is being passed on to the fetus.   Immune systems and environment An overactive immune system can sometimes cause rejection of a pregnancy. This is more frequent in women with lupus, but abnormal antibodies can also be present in perfectly healthy women who have no history of autoimmune disease.  Finally, there is no question that certain environmental toxins can increase the risk of pregnancy loss. Smoking is the biggest threat to a successful pregnancy: just 10 cigarettes a day greatly increase risk of miscarriage. (Consuming two or more alcoholic drinks a day will also up your risk.) Meanwhile, one thing you should put in your mouth when you’re trying to get pregnant is folic acid — at least 1,000 micrograms a day — which can be obtained from any prenatal vitamin.   When to test Most experts don’t do an extensive medical workup after one or two miscarriages, but because a miscarriage is such a traumatic experience and you don’t want to take a chance of enduring it yet another time, you might want to ask your doctor to perform some basic exams. These include:  A pelvic ultrasound after ovulation to make sure your uterine lining has become thick. This will also check for fibroid tumors that could prevent fetal growth. An X-ray of your uterine cavity to rule out malformations (hysterosalpinography) A blood test for your progesterone level on Day 21 of your menstrual cycle A test of your blood thyroid (TSH) level A cervical culture Autoantibody testing  Only after three or possibly four miscarriages would I suggest chromosomal testing of the expelled products of conception and/or genetic tests for you and your partner (a very costly procedure). Once you are pregnant, several tests can reassure you that the pregnancy is “good.” These include blood tests for a hormone called HCG. The hormone is produced by placenta cells and should double every 48 hours the first ten weeks of your pregnancy. In addition, by your sixth week, you can have an ultrasound to check for the fetus’ heartbeat. Once a heartbeat is found and the HCG test is normal, your chances of miscarriage decrease to probably less than 5 percent.   Dr. Reichman’s Bottom Line: Having had two miscarriages does not mean a third is inevitable. On the contrary, chances are your next attempt will be successful. Your doctor can perform some basic tests to ensure that there are no underlying problems and help you attain peace of mind.
