However, some people possess an additional lumbar vertebra located below the L5. This extra vertebra, known as the L6, is called a transitional vertebra. About 10 percent of adults have some form of spinal abnormality caused by genetics and a sixth lumbar vertebra is among the most common of these abnormalities. Read on to learn about spinal conditions that affect the L6 vertebra, along with treatments for the associated symptoms.  Spinal conditions affecting the L6-S1  More often than not, the existence of an L6 does not contribute directly to troublesome spinal conditions. In fact, this vertebra is subject to the same potentially debilitating conditions most people experience at the L5 level. Another difference is the way doctors refer to conditions associated with this transitional vertebra. Rather than speak of it in terms of the L5 to L6 level, it is generally referred to as the L6 to S1 level — denoting an association with the sacral region just below the lumbar vertebrae .  Occasionally, the L6 vertebra can become sacralized, which means it is attached to the sacrum by a rudimentary joint that creates additional motion. Therefore, a greater potential for motion-related stress can lead to lower back pain. Other conditions that affect this vertebra include a herniated disc, a bulging disc, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis, which can occur at any level of the spine.  Treatment for L6 conditions  Doctors who discover the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra through the use of an MRI, X-ray or CT scan are likely to prescribe the same type of conservative treatments for chronic pain management as they would for someone without an L6. These methods of treatment include pain medication, physical therapy, behavior modification and more. Occasionally, conservative treatment proves ineffective and a doctor might suggest seeing if you are a candidate for surgery, such as the minimally invasive procedures offered at Laser Spine Institute.  The outpatient procedures at Laser Spine Institute lead to shorter recovery times and safer and effective alternatives when compared to traditional open spine operations.^ By using a less than 1-inch incision and muscle-sparing techniques, our procedures result in less bleeding and a lower risk of complication than traditional surgery.^ Our minimally invasive procedures are performed on an outpatient basis and have helped more than 75,000 patients find relief from chronic neck and back pain.

Verkuilen, APNP     |   Peer Reviewed                 Spine surgeons and radiologists (who both may read and interpret MRI scans) sometimes differ in their method of labeling a particular spinal segment. This creates confusion - among both patients and insurance companies - triggering the question: "Where is the problem?"  A Sixth Lumbar Vertebra  Lumbar Spine Anatomy Video  One of the reasons for the confusion is that some people, approximately 10% of adults, have a congenital anomaly in their lower back. One of the most common anomalies is the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra. Having one extra lumbar vertebra provides no advantage or disadvantage to the individual and is rarely a cause of back problems, but it can create some confusion. For example:   Radiologists commonly count down from the last rib when numbering the lumbar vertebral bodies.  Surgeons on the other hand, count up from the sacrum when numbering the lumbar vertebrae.   Neither method of labeling lumbar vertebrae is incorrect, but obviously it can create confusion.  For an individual with 5 vertebral bodies, they would be in agreement when labeling the L4-L5 level. If the individual has 6 lumbar vertebrae, however, the radiologist would typically refer to the lowest level as L6-S1 and the level above that L5-L6, which in the surgeon's mind, would be correctly labeled L4-L5.  Article continues below       It is obviously very important to clearly identify the location of lumbosacral anomalies in order to avoid injection or surgical exposure of the incorrect level. This becomes particularly important for minimally invasive procedures. A physical exam and complementary imaging studies, such as an MRI scan and X-ray, can help improve the accuracy and the communication of the diagnosis.  In This Article:     Understanding Back Problems    Normal Spinal Anatomy    Radiculopathy, Radiculitis and Radicular Pain   Spinal Abnormalities Rarely Cause Back Problems   Spine Anatomy Interactive Video      When Spinal Anomalies Cause Back Problems  Patients are sometimes told that a spinal anomaly - such as a sixth lumbar vertebrae or an extra sacral bone - has been found on an X-ray and is causing their back problems. However, anomalies such as these in the lumbar spine and sacral spine are simply variants of normal bony architecture and are typically of no consequence. In other words, it would be very rare for an abnormality such as a sixth lumbar vertebra or extra bone in the sacrum to cause back problems.  Article continues below       The one exception to this general guideline is in cases where the last transverse process (a bony protrusion near the vertebra) is partially attached to the sacrum, or "sacralized". If this bony protrusion is attached to the sacrum, it can create a rudimentary joint (pseudoarticulation) where there shouldn't be one. The resulting motion in this section of the spine can sometimes be a cause of localized low back pain. This condition can usually be successfully treated without surgery. For instance, an injection of steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation of the transverse process and the sacrum can often be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

Main Document The human spinal cord consists of nerves that connect the brain to nerves in the body. It is a superhighway for messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The spinal cord is surrounded for most of its length by the bones (vertebrae) that form the spine. The outer layer of the human spinal cord consists of white matter, i.e., myelin-sheathed nerve fibers. These are bundled into specialized tracts that conduct impulses triggered by pressure, pain, heat, and other sensory stimuli or conduct motor impulses activating muscles and glands. The inner layer, or gray matter, is mainly composed of nerve cell bodies. Within the gray matter, running the length of the cord and extending into the brain, lies the central canal through which the cerebrospinal fluid circulates.  How Long is the Spinal Cord?   The human spinal cord, part of the central nervous system, is around 45 cm (18 in) in men and around 43 cm (17 in) long in women. The spinal cord has a varying width, ranging from 13 mm (1/2 in) thick in the cervical and lumbar regions to 6.4 mm (1/4 in) thick in the thoracic area. Your spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column (spinal column or backbone).   How Many Bones Make Up the Human Spine?   The human spinal column is made up of 33 bones - 7 vertebrae in the cervical region, 12 in the thoracic region, 5 in the lumbar region, 5 in the sacral region and 4 in the coccygeal region.   What is the Difference Between Vertebrates and Invertebrates?   Vertebrates have a backbone or a spinal column.  Invertebrates do not have a backbone or a spinal column.   What is the Difference Between Vertebra and Vertebrae?   Vertebra = Singular  Vertebrae = Plural   What is an SCI?   A spinal cord injury (SCI) can occur anywhere along the spinal cord. It is the result of damage to cells in the spinal cord and causes a loss of communication between the brain and the parts of the body below the injury. Effects of a SCI may include low blood pressure, inability to regulate blood pressure effectively, reduced control of body temperature, inability to sweat below the level of injury, and chronic pain.       Spinal Cord Injury Information on Vertebra C1 to S5    Jump To:   Cervical (C1 - C8)  Thoracic (T1 - T12)  Lumbar (L1 - L5)  Sacral (S1 - S5)    C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8  T1  T2  T3  T4  T5  T6  T7  T8  T9  T10  T11  T12  L1  L2  L3  L4  L5  S1  S2  S3  S4  S5     C1 to C5 Spinal Vertebra Information      Most severe of the spinal cord injury levels.  C2 to C3 - Usually fatal as a result of inability to breathe.  Requires 24 hour a day assistance.  Paralysis in arms, hands, trunk and legs.  Will not be able to drive a car on their own.  Ability to speak is sometimes impaired or reduced.  If both arms and legs are affected, this is called tetraplegia or quadriplegia.  May be able to use powered wheelchairs with special controls to move around on their own.  Patient may not be able to breathe on his or her own, cough, or control bowel or bladder movements.  Requires complete assistance with activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, bathing, and getting in or out of bed.          Cervical (neck) Injuries (C1 to C8)    C1 - Atlas - The Atlas is the topmost vertebra, and along with C2, forms the joint connecting the skull and spine. Its chief peculiarity is that it has no body, and this is due to the fact that the body of the atlas has fused with that of the next vertebra.     C2 - Axis - Forms the pivot upon which C1 rotates. The most distinctive characteristic of this bone is the strong odontoid process (dens) which rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body. The body is deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and front part of the third vertebra. Injuries to C-1 and C-2 can result in a loss of many involuntary functions including the ability to breathe, necessitating breathing aids such as ventilators or diaphragmatic pacemakers.    C3 - Injury to spinal bone three often causes pain, tingling, and sometimes numbness in the arms, neck, and head. If the fourth cervical vertebrae (C4) nerve root is also involved, pain is usually felt in the upper arms and shoulders, as well as the lower neck.    C4 - Cervical Vertebra - Quadriplegia and breathing difficulty - The fourth cervical (neck) vertebra from the top. Injuries above the C-4 level may require a ventilator for the person to breathe properly.    C5 - Quadriplegia with some shoulder and elbow function - 5th cervical vertabrae down from the base of the skull, found in the neck. C5 injuries often maintain shoulder and biceps control, but have no control at the wrist or hand.  C5 to C8 injuries - Corresponding nerves control the arms and hands, a person with this level of spinal injury may still be able to breathe on their own and speak normally.      C6 - Cervical Vertebra - Quadriplegia with shoulder, elbow, and some wrist function - The sixth cervical (neck) vertebra from the top. The next-to-last of the seven cervical vertebrae. An injury to the spinal cord between C6 and C7 vertebrae is called a C6-7 injury. These injuries generally allow wrist control, but no hand function.    C7 - Vertebra Prominens - Quadriplegia with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and some hand function - The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process, hence the name vertebra prominens. In some subjects, the seventh cervical vertebra is associated with an abnormal pair of ribs, known as cervical ribs. These ribs are usually small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing unpleasant symptoms. C-7 and T-1 can straighten their arms but still may have dexterity problems with the hand and fingers. Injuries at the thoracic level and below result in paraplegia, with the hands not affected.    C8 - Quadriplegia with normal arm function; hand weakness - Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there are eight cervical nerves (C1-C8). All nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while the C8 nerve emerges below the C7 vertebra. In other words C8 is a nerve root not a vertebrae.        Thoracic Vertebrae (T1 to T12)    The thoracic vertebrae increase in size from T1 through T12 and represent the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae are situated between the cervical (neck) vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae. These thoracic vertebrae provide attachment for the ribs and make up part of the back of the thorax or chest. Damage or SCI's above the T1 vertebra affects the arms and the legs. Injuries below the T1 vertebra affect the legs and trunk below the injury, but usually do not affect the arms and hands. Paralysis of the legs is called paraplegia . Paralysis of the arms AND legs is called quadriplegia . The most common fractures of the spine occur in the thoracic (midback) and lumbar spine (lower back) or at the connection of the two (thoracolumbar junction). These fractures are typically caused by high-velocity accidents, such as a car crash, or a fall from height.   T1 to T6 - Paraplegia with loss of function below mid-chest; full control of arms  T1 to T8 - Most often control the hands, but poor trunk control as the result of lack of abdominal muscle control.  T6 to T12 - Paraplegia with loss of function below the waist; good control of torso  T9 to T12 - Allow good trunk control and abdominal muscle control. Lumbar and Sacral injuries yield decreasing control of the hip flexors and legs. Individuals with SCI also experience other changes. For example, they may experience dysfunction of the bowel and bladder.  Corresponding nerves affect muscles, upper chest, mid-back and abdominal muscles.   T1 to T5 Thoracic Nerves   Can learn to drive a modified car.  Arm and hand function is usually fairly normal.  Will most likely need to use a manual wheelchair.  Injuries usually affect the trunk and legs (paraplegia).  Can stand with the use of a standing frame, some patients may walk with braces   T6 to T12 Thoracic Nerves   Nerves affect muscles of the trunk (abdominal and back muscles) depending on the level of injury.  Usually results in paraplegia.  Normal upper-body movement.  Can learn to drive an adapted vehicle.  Most likely will need to use a manual wheelchair.  Should be able to cough productively (if abdominal muscles are intact).  A fair to good ability to control and balance the body while in a seated position.  Some patients will be capable of standing in a standing frame, while others may require the use of braces to walk.  Often will have little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder function but can usually manage on their own with adaptive equipment.      T1 - Comparatively speaking, T1 is the smallest of all thoracic vertebrae. The T1 vertebra is the first (uppermost) of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae that make up the central and largest section of the spinal column between the lumbar vertebrae below and the cervical vertebrae above.    T2 - The second vertebra in the thoracic spine is responsible for helping to support the rib cage. The T2 vertebra possesses facets that create joints with two of the ribs, thus helping to keep the thoracic spine far more stable than the cervical spine in the neck or the lumbar spine in the lower back. T2 vertebra degeneration include: Herniated, bulging or prolapsed discs, Bone spurs, Facet disease, Forms of osteoarthritis and Traumatic or sports-related injuries.    T3 - The third thoracic vertebrae is a small vertebra in the upper middle back that plays an integral role in supporting the rib cage. The anterior aspect of the upper thoracic spine is a difficult region to approach in spinal surgery.    T4 - Spinal cord transection at T4 results in severe damage of the nervous tissue, with impairment of motor, sensory and autonomic functions. T4 syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition in which spinal injury at the T4 vertebra causes a set of symptoms including diffuse arm pain and pins and needles or numbness in the upper arm.    T5 - The T5 vertebra, as well as the rest of the thoracic spine, provides a stable foundation for the human rib cage.    T6 - An injury at the level of T6 (thoracic) spinal cord results in damage to the autonomic nervous system, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, affecting the function of major abdominal organs.    T7 - The T7 vertebra is in the middle of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae of the torso and the center of the spinal column. Thoracic vertebrae play an important role, not only in the protection of the spinal cord, but also in the protection of vital organs. A vertebral compression fracture refers to a break of the vertebral body, most often below the T7 level of the thoracic spine (upper back), and is most commonly caused by weakened bone resulting from osteoporosis. Most vertebral compression fractures result in a loss of more than 15% to 20% of the height of the vertebra.    T8 - T8 vertebra is toward the lower (caudal) end of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae within the central, torso section of the spine. Like other spinal vertebrae, the T8 primarily protects and encases the spinal cord. The T8 is also at the same level as the xiphoid process. The eighth thoracic spinal nerve runs beneath the T8. Throughout the thoracic spine, discs like those above and beneath the T8 vertebra can become damaged and cause painful symptoms.    T9 - T9 to T12 are known as the transition vertebrae. The lumbar cord is situated between T9 and T11 vertebrae. T9 to T12 injuries can be classified as either complete or incomplete injuries. Complete injuries result in the total loss of movement and sensation below the point of injury, while incomplete injuries indicate that some function below the level of injury is retained.    T10 - T10 is situated at the umbilicus. The T10 vertebra is near to the bottom of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12) within the torso and making up the central portion of the spinal column. This particular vertebra has a complete articular facet and the thoracic spinal nerves passes out under it. T10 innervates the muscles of the lower abdomen. It is part of the section of the spinal cord which is most vulnerable to injury due to the area's high level of flexibility. An injury in this area will most likely experience limited or complete loss of use of the muscles in the lower abdomen, buttocks, legs, and feet. Extent of disability is determined by damage done to the T10 vertebra. Partial damage may cause weakness, numbness, lack of muscle control, or loss of the use of one side of the lower body. Complete damage could result in the loss of use of the lower body (paraplegia).    T11 - The ribs connected to T11 and T12 at the bottom of the thoracic spine do not attach the sternum in front, but do provide protection for the kidneys in the back of the body. Because these levels have slightly less stability, they are slightly more prone to problems that can cause pain. A person with a T11 vertebral injury may have or recover sensations in the L1 through L4 dermatomes which include the front of the leg down to the mid-shin level. In addition, such a patient should recover hip extensors, knee extensors, and even ankle dorsiflexion. However, the sacral functions, including bowel and bladder and many of the flexor functions of the leg may be absent or weak.    T12 - T12 ends just above the hip girdle. T12 bears the most weight of any thoracic vertebra, making it the strongest thoracic vertebra, but also the most susceptible to stress-related injuries. Compression fractures of the spine usually occur at the bottom part of the thoracic spine (T11 and T12) and the first vertebra of the lumbar spine (L1). The most common thoracic spinal cord injury involves T11 and T12.        Lumbar Vertebrae (L1 to L5)    Lumbar nerves (L1 to L5) injuries generally result in some loss of function in the hips and legs. Often there is little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but patients usually manage on their own with the use of special equipment. Depending on strength in the legs, some patients may need a wheelchair and may also walk with braces. The lumbar vertebrae graduate in size from L1 through L5. These vertebrae bear much of the body's weight and related biomechanical stress. The lumbar vertebrae are also the largest segments of the movable part of the vertebral column, and are characterized by the absence of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process, and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body. Some individuals have four lumbar vertebrae, while others have six. Lumbar disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these individuals.     L1 - The first lumbar vertebra is at the same level as the ninth rib. This level is also called the important transpyloric plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level.    L2 - Injuries to the spinal column at L2 or lower will damage the tip of the spinal cord, called the conus, or the spray of spinal roots that are descending to the appropriate spinal vertebral levels to exit the spinal canal or the caudal equina.    L3 - The L3 vertebra is in the middle of the five lumbar vertebrae in the lower back portion of the spinal column. The L3 vertebra, or third lumbar vertebra, is one of the most common sites for the occurrence of a herniated disc and other spinal conditions that can cause chronic lower back pain. A lot of motion in the back is divided between these five motion segments with segments L3 - L4 and L4 - L5 taking most of the stress. L3 - L4 and L4 - L5 segments are most likely to breakdown from wear and tear causing such conditions as osteoarthritis. L2 and L3 cover the front part of the thighs.    L4 - The most likely to herniate. The effects of this can cause pain and numbness that can radiate through the leg and extend down to the feet (sciatica). Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are conditions that affect the moveable joints of the spine that help keep the vertebrae aligned one on top of the other. Spondylolysis is actually a weakness or stress fracture in one of the bony bridges that connects the upper and lower facet joints. This fracture can happen at any level of the spine but usually occurs at the fourth (L4) or fifth (L5) lumbar vertebra. L4 and L5 fractures are commonly the result of a high impact trauma from falls or motor vehicle accidents.    L5 - The fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) is the largest of the five lumbar vertebrae and is considered an atypical vertebra due to its shape. As the last of the lumbar vertebrae, the L5 vertebra bears more body weight than any of the other 23 vertebrae that sit atop it in the vertebral column. The L4 and L5 disc, in between the L4 and L5 vertebrae, can herniate or degenerate, leading to possible leg pain (sciatica) and/or lower back pain. The fifth lumbar vertebra is the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. Sacral Nerves (S1 to S5) injuries generally result in some loss of functionin the hips and legs. Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but patients can manage on their own with special equipment Most likely they will also still be able to walk.        Sacral Nerves (S1 to S5)    The sacrum is shaped different in males and females. In females the sacrum is shorter and wider than in males. The Sacrum is located behind the pelvis. Five bones (abbreviated S1 through S5) fused into a triangular shape, form the sacrum. The sacrum fits between the two hipbones connecting the spine to the pelvis located just below the lumbar vertebrae. The Sacrum consists of four or five sacral vertebrae in a child, which become fused into a single bone after age 26. The sacrum forms the back wall of the pelvic girdle and moves with it.  The first three vertebrae in the sacral have transverse processes which come together to form wide lateral wings called alae. These alae articulate with the blades of the pelvis (ilium).  As part of the pelvic girdle, the sacrum forms the back wall of the pelvis and also forms joints at the hip bone called the sacroiliac joints. The sacrum contains a series of four openings on each side through which the sacral nerves and blood vessels run. The sacral canal runs down the center of the sacrum and represents the end of the vertebral canal.  Back pain or leg pain ( sciatica ) can typically arise due to injury where the lumbar spine and sacral region connect (at L5 - S1) because this section of the spine is subjected to a large amount of stress and twisting.  People with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis are inclined to develop stress fractures and fatigue fractures in the sacrum.  The bottom of the spinal column is called the coccyx or tailbone. It consists of 3 to 5 bones that are fused together in an adult. Many muscles connect to the coccyx.  Sacral Nerves (S1 to S5) injuries generally result in some loss of function in the hips and legs. Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but can manage on their own with special equipment Most likely will be able to walk.     S1 -  L5 to S1 Isthmic Spondylolisthesis: A small fracture in the facet joints can allow the L5 vertebra to slip forward over the S1 vertebra, impinging the nerve root and leading to leg pain and other symptoms.  L5-S1 disc herniation: Occurs when the inner portion leaks out and touches the nearby nerve root, causing pain to radiate in the lower back and/or down the leg.  L5-S1 degenerative disc disease: If the L5-S1 disc is compromised, the L5-S1 disc itself can become a source of lower back and/or leg pain.      S2 - S2 is located at the level of posterior superior iliac spine. S2 covers the back of the thighs.    S3 - S3 cover the medial side of the buttocks.    S4 - S4-5 covers the perineal region.    S5 - S5 is the lowest dermatome and represents the skin immediately at and adjacent to the anus.

The 24 presacral vertebrae allow movementand hence render the vertebral column flexible. Stability is providedby ligaments, muscles, and the form of the bones. The abbreviations C.,T., L., S., and Co. are used for the regions, and these are sometimesfollowed by V. for vertebra or N. for nerve.  Curvatures.   The adult vertebral column presents four anteroposteriorcurvatures: thoracic and sacral, both concave anteriorly, and cervicaland lumbar, both concave posteriorly (fig. 39-1 ). Thethoracic and sacral curvatures, termed primary, appear during theembryonic period proper, whereas the cervical and lumbar curvatures,termed secondary, appear later (although before birth) and areaccentuated in infancy by support of the head and by the adoption of anupright posture.  Parts of a Vertebra.   A typical vertebra consists of (1) a body and (2) a vertebralarch, which has several processes (articular, transverse, and spinous)for articular and muscular attachments. Between the body and the archis the vertebral foramen: the sum of the vertebral foramina constitutesthe vertebral canal, which houses the spinal cord (fig. 39-2 ). Inaddition to the transverse and spinous processes, which serve as shortlevers, the 12 thoracic vertebrae are connected by joints with paired,long levers, namely the ribs.  The bodies of the vertebrae are separated from each other byintervertebral discs. The body is mainly spongy bone and red marrow,but the margins of the upper and lower surfaces consist of a ring ofcompact bone, the vertebral end-plates. The body is marked on its sidesby vascular foramina.  The vertebral arch consists of right and left pedicles (which connectit to the body) and right and left laminae. The transverse processesemerge laterally at the junction of the pedicles and laminae, and thespinous process proceeds posteriorly from the union of the laminae. Thesuperior and inferior articular processes project vertically from thevertebral arches on each side and bear articular facets. When vertebraare in their anatomical position, notches between adjacent pediclesform intervertebral foramina, each of which typically transmitsneuralstructures including a spinal ganglion and a ventral root of a spinalnerve.  Relationship of Spinal Nervesto Vertebrae.   The first cervical nerve emerges between the skull and theatlas, and cervical nerves C2 to 7 continue to leave the vertebralcanal above the correspondingly numbered vertebrae. C8 emerges betweenthe C7 and T1 vertebrae, and the remaining spinal nerves leave belowthe correspondingly numbered vertebrae.    Regional characteristics ofvertebrae  The vertebrae of each region have special characteristics, which arenow described.   Cervical Vertebrae.  The seven vertebrae of the neck are characterized by an opening in eachtransverse process known as a foramen transversarium. The upper sixpairs of foramina transversaria transmit the vertebral artery. The C1vertebra, which supports the skull, is termed the atlas, and C2, whichserves as a pivot for the atlas, is termed the axis.  Atlas (fig. 39-3 ).  The atlas (C1), which has neither body nor spinous process, consistsof two lateral masses connected by a short anterior and a longerposterior arch. Each lateral mass presents upper and lower facets, forthe occipital condyle of the skull and for the axis, respectively. Thetransverse processes are long and are vaguely palpable in vivoimmediately below the auricle. The anterior arch presents an anteriortubercle in front (for the anterior longitudinal ligament) and a facetposteriorly (for the dens of the axis). The posterior arch is groovedabove for the vertebral artery and the small C1 nerve on each side, andit presents a posterior tubercle behind.  Axis (fig. 39-4 ).  The axis (C2) is characterized by the dens (or odontoid process),which projects upward from the body and articulates with the anteriorarch of the atlas. The dens is anchored to the occipital bone (byapical and alar ligaments) and is limited behind by the transverseligament of the atlas (fig. 39-3 ). It is frequently claimed that the densrepresents the body of the atlas, but this is doubtful. *   Remaining cervical vertebrae(fig. 39-5 ).  The lower cervical vertebrae, C2 to 6 are typical and present short,bifid spinous processes. The bodies are small and oval in shape. Thereare superiorly-projecting lips at the superolateral borders of thevertebral bodies. These closely match indentations in the lateralborder of inferior aspect of the vertebral body above. Each transverseprocess, pierced by a foramen transversarium, ends laterally inanterior and posterior tubercles, which are connected by an"intertubercular lamella" or bar. # The bars are grooved by the ventral primary rami of the spinal nerves,which pass posterior to the foramina transversaria. The anteriortubercles of C6 vertebra are large and are termed the carotidtubercles, because the common carotid arteries can be compressedagainst them. C7 vertebra has a long, non-bifid spinous process and isknown as the vertebra prominens. (The spinous processes of C6 and 7 andT1 are usually visible in vivo when the neck is flexed.) The anteriortubercles (costal processes) of C7 vertebra may develop separately ascervical ribs. (Lumbar ribs are less frequent.)   Thoracic Vertebrae (figs. 39-5 , 39-6 and 39-7 ).  It should be noted that all vertebrae are dorsal, although only 12 arethoracic. The 12 vertebrae of the thorax bear the ribs. The T1 vertebra(like C.V.7) is transitional in appearance. T2 to 8 vertebra aretypical thoracic vertebrae with a kidney shaped body (fig. 39-5 ).Demifacets for the heads of the ribs (see fig. 20-3 ) arefound supeiorly and inferiorly at the junction of the body and pedicle.The transverse processes of T1 to 10 have costal facets for thetubercles of the ribs. The spinous processes are long, slender,and sloping: their tips lie opposite the subjacent body or even at thelevel of the intervertebral disc below the subjacent body. Thevarious facets for the ribs on T1 and on T9 to 12 veertebral bodies arearranged differently. T11 and 12 are transitional in form, i.e., partlyresembling lumbar vertebrae. A humped back is termed kyphosis.   Lumbar Vertebrae (figs. 39-8 and 39-9 ).  The five vertebrae between the thorax and sacrum are large and presentneither foramina transversaria nor costal facets (fig. 39-5 ). Thebody is kidney shpaed, and the pedicles and laminae are short andthick. The part of the lamina between the superior and inferiorarticular processes is known as the pars interarticularis and is liableto injury in some people (resulting in spondylolisthesis, i.e., aslipping forward of the body of one vertebra on the vertebra or sacrumbelow it). A mamillary process projects posteriorward from the superiorarticular process. The transverse process, which corresponds to a rib,is long and thin, and an accessory process may project inferiorwardfrom its root. The spinous processes are quadrilateral and projecthorizontally backward. The fifth lumbar vertebra, usually the largestvertebra, is mainly responsible for the lumbosacral angle (between thelumbar part of the column and the sacrum). Excessive "hollowing" of theback is termed lordosis.   Sacrum (figs. 39-10 and 39-11 ).  Five (sometimes six) vertebrae are fused in the adult to form thesacrum, which can be felt below the "small of the back." The sacrumarticulates above with L5, laterally with the hip bones, and inferiorlywith the coccyx. It has a roughly triangular appearance with a pelvicand dorsal surface, a lateral mass on each side, and a base and apex.The pelvic surface, concave and facing antero-inferiorly, presents fourpaired sacral foramina for the ventral primary rami of sacral nerves 1to 4. The dorsal surface, convex and facing posterosuperiorly, presentsa modified series of spinous processes termed the median sacral crestand four paired sacral foramina for the dorsal primary rami of sacralnerves 1 to 4. Below, the sacrum shows right and left sacral cornua,which bound a variable gap termed the sacral hiatus. An anesthetic forthe spinal nerves may be injected extradurally through the sacralhiatus (caudal analgesia). The cornua articulate with correspondinghorns on the coccyx. The lateral part or mass of the sacrum, lateral tothe sacral foramina, consists of the fused transverse processes(including their costal elements). Its superior surface is frequentlytermed the ala. The superolateral part of the lateral mass presents theauricular (ear-shaped) surface for articulation with the hip bone(sacro-iliac joint). The surface is limited behind by an area (sacraltuberosity) for interosseous ligaments. The base, formed by the supriorpart of the first sacral vertebra, presents a prominent anterior margintermed the promontory (fig. 39-11 ). Superior articular processes articulatewith the fifth lumbar vertebra. The sacral canal (which contains thedura, cauda equina, and filum terminale) extends from the base to thesacral hiatus. The apex of the sacrum may be fused with the coccyx.  Coccyx (fig. 39-10 ).  The vertebrae (usually four) below the sacrum are variably fused in theadult to form the coccyx, which resembles a miniature sacrum in shape.   Development of vertebrae(figs. 39-12 and 39-13 )  Vertebrae develop in mesenchyme and cartilage during the embryonicperiod proper, and most begin to ossify during fetal life. Typically, avertebra at birth shows three ossific areas, one for the centrum(defined in fig. 39-14 ) and one for each half of the neural arch.At about puberty, ossific centers appear in the margins of the upperand lower surfaces of the body (ring epiphyses) and at the tips of thevarious processes. Developmental failure of half a vertebra(hemivertebra) is one cause of lateral curvature (scoliosis).  Failure of fusion of the halves of one or more neural (futurevertebral) arches is termed spina bifida. The meninges alone(meningocele), or the spinal cord and meninges (meningomyelocele), mayprotrude through the defect (spina bifida cystica). When the defect isskeletal rather than neural, it may be concealed by the skin (althoughsometimes marked by a tuft of hair) and is termed spina bifida occulta.In the sacrum, this is quite common.   Surface anatomy   The spinous processes of the vertebrae are palpable in the medianfurrow of the back. The external occipital protuberance is palpable inadults. The spines of vertebrae C6, C7, and T1 are usuallyprominent and palpable, and they are made more conspicuous by flexionof the neck and trunk. In the thoracic region, the spinous processof each vertebra extends to the level of at least the body of thevertebra below. The inferior angle of the scapula is frequently at thelevel of the spinous process of T7. A horizontal plane between thehighest points of the iliac crests (supracristal plane) is usually atthe level of the spinous process of L4, and this is used as a landmarkfor lumbar puncture. A needle introduced here should enter thesubarachnoid space after 4 to 6 cm. The posterior superior iliac spineis commonly marked by a skin dimple (fig. 39-15 ).

Questions   39-1 How many vertebrae are movable? 39-1 The 24"presacral" vertebrae aremovable. Eighty-nine per cent of people have 24 presacral vertebrae, 6per cent have 23, and 5 per cent have 25 (P. E. Bomstein and R. R.Peterson, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 25:139-146, 1966).    39-2 Which curvatures first appear in thevertebral column? 39-2 The thoracic andsacral curvaturesareprimary (appearing during embryonic life). The cervical and lumbarcurvatures are secondary (appearing during fetal life and accentuatedduring infancy).    39-3 How many processes characterize avertebral arch? 39-3 A typicalvertebral arch ischaracterized by at least seven processes: four articular, twotransverse, and one spinous. Lumbar vertebrae have small, additional(mamillary and accessory) processes. The axis has an odontoid process(the dens) but no superior articular processes (merely facets). Theatlas has only transverse processes.    39-4 Where are the intervertebral foraminaand what do they contain? 39-4 Theintervertebral foramina arebetween adjacent pedicles, and typically each contains a spinalganglion and a ventral root (or rootlets) of a spinal nerve (see fig. 41-3 ).    39-5 Between which vertebrae does the C8nerve emerge? 39-5 C8 nerve rootemerges between C7 andT1 vertebrae. Hence the remaining spinal nerves below leave inferior tothe correspondingly numbered vertebrae.    39-6 What are the key features of thecervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae? 39-6 The key featuresof cervical,thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae are, respectively, foraminatransversaria, articulation with ribs, absence of both of the abovefeatures, and fusion.    39-7 How many dorsal vertebrae are presentin the body? 39-7 All 33 vertebraeare dorsal. Twelveare thoracic.    39-8 What is the pars interarticularis? 39-8 The parsinterarticularis, visibleonoblique radiographs of the lumbar vertebrae (see fig. 39-9 ), isthe part of the neural arch between the superior and inferior articularprocesses. The slipping forward of a vertebral body (e.g., L5) istermed spondylolisthesis (Gk, vertebral slipping) and usually involvesfracture at the pars interarticularis. Case Report. A 50-year-old nursecomplained of numbness of the right big toe, a burning pain down thelateral side of the right leg and foot, bowel and bladder problems, andweakness of the lower limbs. She developed a marked depression over thespinous process of L5. At operation, spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 wasfound, with defective partes interarticulares of L5 and protrusion ofthe L4/5 disc. The leg pains were caused by compression of L5 nerveroots from alterations of the L5/S1 facets. Bowel and bladderdifficulties were produced by compression of the cauda equina fromgross distortion of the vertebral canal. Decompression by removal ofsome bone near the pedicles relieved the symptoms (G. Austin, TheSpinal Cord, Thomas, Springfield, Illinois, 1961). Numerous casestudies on anatomy have been described by E. Lachman (Case Studies inAnatomy, 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1981) and also byL. K. Schneider (Anatomical Case Histories, Year Book, Chicago, 1976).    39-9 What are the chief contents of thesacral canal? 39-9 The sacral canalcontains the dura,cauda equina, and filum terminale. Above S2, a subarachnoid space isalso present (see fig. 41-1 ).    39-10 What is the ossific status of atypical vertebra at birth? 39-10 At birth, atypical vertebra showsthree primary ossific areas, one for the centrum and one for each halfof the neural arch. (The centrum does not correspond to the whole ofthe body: see fig. 39-14 .) The three primary areas become united bybone in early childhood (3 to 6 years). A number of secondary centers(the ring epiphyses and centers for the tips of the transverse andspinous processes) appear at about puberty.    39-11 How is surgical access to thespinal cord achieved? 39-11 Surgical accessto the spinal cordand nerve roots is achieved by sectioning the laminae (laminectomy) oneach side of several vertebrae.    39-12 What is spina bifida? 39-12 Spina bifida isa developmentalanomaly in which the halves of one or more neural (future vertebral)arches have failed to fuse. The spinal cord and meninges(myelomeningocele), or the meninges alone (meningocele), may protrudethrough the defect (spina bifida cystica). When the defect is skeletalrather than neural, it is termed spina bifida occulta; this defect isfound in the sacrum in approximately one fifth of the generalpopulation (A. C. Berry, J. Anal., 120:519,1975), although theincidence is minute in certain peoples (J. I. Levy and C. Freed, J.Anal., 114:449, 1973).    39-13 Which Latin and Greek roots areused with reference to the vertebral column? 39-13 The Latin rootsspino- andvertebro-are used with reference to the vertebral column (e.g., inspinotransverse and vertebrocostal). Greek roots with a similarsignificance are spondyl- and rhachi- (e.g., in spondylolisthesis andrachischisis, the latter meaning "vertebral cleft" and used for an openspina bifida, especially one that extends along many vertebrae).

The superior aspect of the lateralpart is the ala.  Figure 39-12 Scheme of horizontal sections of vertebrae, showing what are thought tobe corresponding parts. Note that the costal element forms a part ofthe transverse process of a cervical vertebra. It forms the rib in thethoracic region, most of the transverse process in the lumbar region,and the greater portion of the lateral part of the sacrum. In thecervical vertebra, the posterior tubercle of the transverse processshould probably also be shaded as part of the costal element.  Figure 39-13 Variations in vertebrae. B shows the common arrangement. In A, "cranialshift," a cervical rib articulates with C7 and rib 12 is small. In B,L5 is partially "sacralized" and S5 is partially freed. In C, "caudalshift," rib 12 is large and a small lumbar rib is present. S1 vertebrais partially "lumbarized" and Co.1 is incorporated into the sacrum.(After Schinz et al.)  Figure 39-14 The neural arch and centrum (left half of figure), and the vertebralarch and body (right half). The terms centrum and neural arch refer tothose parts of a vertebra ossified from primary centers. The termsvertebral arch and body are descriptive terms generally applied toadult vertebrae. The body of a vertebra includes the centrum and partof the neural arch. The vertebral arch, therefore, is less extensivethan the neural arch. Note that the rib articulates with the neuralarch and not with the centrum.  Figure 39-15 Some surface landmarks of the back. (From Royce, L Surface Anatomy,Davis, Philadelphia, 1965,)   * See F.

Maybe you've even become something of an expert. If so, you know that there are five vertebrae in the lumbar region of the spinal cord , the portion of the spine that curves in your lower back. But like many biological “facts,” there are exceptions to every rule.   Sixth lumbar vertebrae in your spine are uncommon, but far from extraordinary. About 10% of the population has an extra bone in this region, and while additional vertebrae don't typically affect your health, they can complicate treatment for spinal cord injuries.  A Sixth Vertebrae?  The sixth vertebra is typically located just below L5, making it the lowest vertebra and positioning it next to your tailbone. The extra bone is essentially just a harmless anomaly; sometimes it's because one vertebra failed to fuse with another, but in other cases it's unclear why the bone appeared. L6 vertebrae don't grow overnight. If you have the condition, you've always had it. In the overwhelming majority of people, this condition causes no symptoms .  Learn the full anatomy of the spine by downloading the: Simplified Guide to Understanding a Spinal Cord Injury.    How an Extra Bone Affects Spine Health  An L6 vertebra is not, in and of itself, cause for concern, and most people go through their entire lives without even knowing they have the condition. However, this additional bone can complicate spinal health in some situations.  Doctors sometimes vary the direction they count when identifying spinal structures, and the presence of an additional bone can cause them to give the wrong number; a doctor who doesn't know your condition might label your bottommost lumbar vertebra L5 when it is in fact L6.  Rarely, the L6 vertebra becomes fused to another vertebra, causing back pain. This portion of the spine is also vulnerable to bulging or herniated discs. And because there is an additional bone fitted into the space of five vertebrae, the presence of an L6 can decrease the flexibility of the spine. Lastly, if your spinal cord injury is very low, it might affect your L6 vertebrae.   Will an Extra Vertebrae Affect Spinal Cord Injury Treatment?  A sixth lumbar vertebra should not affect treatment for your spinal cord injury though you should ensure that every physician who treats you knows about the condition. This ensures no one inaccurately counts to the wrong portion of your spine.  An additional vertebra does not increase the odds of suffering a spinal cord injury since the additional vertebra is in essentially the same spot as L5. Moreover, injuries to this vertebrae are unlikely to cause complete immobility since the injury is so low. Pain from this area, due to fusion to another vertebra, may worsen symptoms of a spinal cord injury. If you experience new or worsening symptoms, be sure to notify your doctor.

However, some people possess an additional lumbar vertebra located below the L5. This extra vertebra, known as the L6, is called a transitional vertebra. About 10 percent of adults have some form of spinal abnormality caused by genetics and a sixth lumbar vertebra is among the most common of these abnormalities. Read on to learn about spinal conditions that affect the L6 vertebra, along with treatments for the associated symptoms.  Spinal conditions affecting the L6-S1  More often than not, the existence of an L6 does not contribute directly to troublesome spinal conditions. In fact, this vertebra is subject to the same potentially debilitating conditions most people experience at the L5 level. Another difference is the way doctors refer to conditions associated with this transitional vertebra. Rather than speak of it in terms of the L5 to L6 level, it is generally referred to as the L6 to S1 level — denoting an association with the sacral region just below the lumbar vertebrae .  Occasionally, the L6 vertebra can become sacralized, which means it is attached to the sacrum by a rudimentary joint that creates additional motion. Therefore, a greater potential for motion-related stress can lead to lower back pain. Other conditions that affect this vertebra include a herniated disc, a bulging disc, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis, which can occur at any level of the spine.  Treatment for L6 conditions  Doctors who discover the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra through the use of an MRI, X-ray or CT scan are likely to prescribe the same type of conservative treatments for chronic pain management as they would for someone without an L6. These methods of treatment include pain medication, physical therapy, behavior modification and more. Occasionally, conservative treatment proves ineffective and a doctor might suggest seeing if you are a candidate for surgery, such as the minimally invasive procedures offered at Laser Spine Institute.  The outpatient procedures at Laser Spine Institute lead to shorter recovery times and safer and effective alternatives when compared to traditional open spine operations.^ By using a less than 1-inch incision and muscle-sparing techniques, our procedures result in less bleeding and a lower risk of complication than traditional surgery.^ Our minimally invasive procedures are performed on an outpatient basis and have helped more than 75,000 patients find relief from chronic neck and back pain.  Contact Laser Spine Institute to learn about the advanced techniques our surgeons utilize and request a no-cost MRI review* to learn if our minimally invasive spine surgery would be effective in relieving the conditions located at your L6 vertebra.

Verkuilen, APNP     |   Peer Reviewed                 Spine surgeons and radiologists (who both may read and interpret MRI scans) sometimes differ in their method of labeling a particular spinal segment. This creates confusion - among both patients and insurance companies - triggering the question: "Where is the problem?"  A Sixth Lumbar Vertebra  Lumbar Spine Anatomy Video  One of the reasons for the confusion is that some people, approximately 10% of adults, have a congenital anomaly in their lower back. One of the most common anomalies is the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra. Having one extra lumbar vertebra provides no advantage or disadvantage to the individual and is rarely a cause of back problems, but it can create some confusion. For example:   Radiologists commonly count down from the last rib when numbering the lumbar vertebral bodies.  Surgeons on the other hand, count up from the sacrum when numbering the lumbar vertebrae.   Neither method of labeling lumbar vertebrae is incorrect, but obviously it can create confusion.  For an individual with 5 vertebral bodies, they would be in agreement when labeling the L4-L5 level. If the individual has 6 lumbar vertebrae, however, the radiologist would typically refer to the lowest level as L6-S1 and the level above that L5-L6, which in the surgeon's mind, would be correctly labeled L4-L5.  Article continues below       It is obviously very important to clearly identify the location of lumbosacral anomalies in order to avoid injection or surgical exposure of the incorrect level. This becomes particularly important for minimally invasive procedures. A physical exam and complementary imaging studies, such as an MRI scan and X-ray, can help improve the accuracy and the communication of the diagnosis.  In This Article:     Understanding Back Problems    Normal Spinal Anatomy    Radiculopathy, Radiculitis and Radicular Pain   Spinal Abnormalities Rarely Cause Back Problems   Spine Anatomy Interactive Video      When Spinal Anomalies Cause Back Problems  Patients are sometimes told that a spinal anomaly - such as a sixth lumbar vertebrae or an extra sacral bone - has been found on an X-ray and is causing their back problems. However, anomalies such as these in the lumbar spine and sacral spine are simply variants of normal bony architecture and are typically of no consequence. In other words, it would be very rare for an abnormality such as a sixth lumbar vertebra or extra bone in the sacrum to cause back problems.  Article continues below       The one exception to this general guideline is in cases where the last transverse process (a bony protrusion near the vertebra) is partially attached to the sacrum, or "sacralized". If this bony protrusion is attached to the sacrum, it can create a rudimentary joint (pseudoarticulation) where there shouldn't be one. The resulting motion in this section of the spine can sometimes be a cause of localized low back pain. This condition can usually be successfully treated without surgery. For instance, an injection of steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation of the transverse process and the sacrum can often be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

Have you studied this at all and do you know how it might affect the spinal cord and nerve roots?  I guess I'm just curious as this kind of thing fascinates me.  I was born with two extra fingers, so I'm a bit of a mutant myself. They had tiny fingernails, but no bone or apparent muscle, so both were 'tied off' after birth.  My younger brother was born with one extra, and my folks were told if they had any more kids they would like be 'polydactyl' as well.  Too bad I wasn't born with a redundant CNS like a Klingon.  OK, my geekiness is starting to show, so I'll shut up now.  ~Rus  "Because you're not promised tomorrow." ~ Stuck Mojo             Reply With Quote              10-12-2001, 11:28 PM    #2        Wise Young    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message    View Blog Entries    Visit Homepage    View Articles       Administrator       Join Date  Jul 2001  Location  New Brunswick, NJ, USA  Posts  38,593          Rus,  Very interesting.  A number of people (I was not able to identify a reliable source of the incidence of such an occurrence) have a 13th rib, usually from L1 vertebra.  This is often associated with a 6th lumbar vertebra.  Such an extra vertebra is sometimes called a transitional vertebra.  Accordin to the following web site   http://www.vh.org/Providers/Textbook...Vertebrae.html  the incidence of a transitional vertebra is 4.2% in a very large series of skeletons (4200).  Also, lumbosacral transitional vertebrae vary by race.      Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae were found to vary by race. It was reported that they were present in 18% of Australian aboriginals (Mitchell), 16% of Indians (Bustami), 10% of Arabs (Bustami), 8.1% of natives of Britain (Brailsford), and 5.8% of Japanese (Toyoda). Bustami studied 340 sacra of two population groups (Arab and Indian). Of these 340 sacra, 32 or 9.4% showed evidence of unilateral sacralization and 14 or 4.1% showed bilateral sacralization. Lumbarization was no found in the 340 sacra examined. Sacralization was present to some degree in 46 specimens (13.5%). The incidence of total sacralization was 10% in Arab and was 16% in Indian population groups. Arab males had a higher incidence in all stages of sacralization while it was the Indian females that showed the higher incidence in their group.   You may be interested to find that while the homo sapien is characterized by having five lumbar vertebra but homo erectus (the first of the human skeletons found in Africa, including Lucy and australopithecus africanus skeletons) typically had 6 lumbar vertebra.  The presence of a 13th rib is of passing interest from the point of view of the Bible which suggests that God made Eve from the 13th rib of Adam.   http://www.angelfire.com/mi/dinosaurs/erectus_ribs.html  Animals generally have more vertebra than humans.  For example, most animals have 12-15 thoracic vertebrae and 6-7 lumbar vertebrae although some whales may have as many as 20 lumbar vertebrae.  Cows have 13 thoracic and 6 lumbar vertebrae.  Pigs have 13-17 thoracic vertebrae and 5-7 lumbar vertebrae.  Sheep have 13-14 thoracic vertebrae and 6 to 7 lumbar vertebrae.  In contrast, almost all mammals have 7 cervical vertebrae, including human.  http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/skeleton.html  Wise             Reply With Quote              10-13-2001, 12:28 PM    #3        cheesecake    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message    View Blog Entries    View Articles       Moderator       Join Date  Aug 2001  Location  USA  Posts  7,535        Co-joined nerves    Can you explain what co-joined nerve roots are? I was told it is a congenital defect but had no awareness of it until my injury. It showed on the MRI and is part of the reason I did not have the type of recovery and the motor and sensory loss was greater. Is this uncommon or something that people have but are never aware of until a problem arises?

These include co-joined roots where one or more roots, instead of each coming out separate through the appropriate opening of the spinal column, join and come out in the wrong opening.  I am no t sure why this should change the recovery from spinal cord injury.  Several anomalies of the spinal column are very well known to increase the risk of spinal cord injury.  The most prominent of these is stenosis of the cervical or lumbar canal, where t he space in which the spinal cord resides is narrowed.  Football players who have stenosis are more likely to get paralysis when hit.  Do you have scoliosis?  This also predisposes to spinal cord injury.  Interestingly, for reasons that are not well-under stood, scoliosis is much more common in females than males.  Scoliosis is also associated with a high incidence of tethering of the spinal cord which predisposes to greater risk and severity of spinal cord injury.

It was discovered after I was in a terrible auto accident 25 years ago.  Since that time, I have had a "bony protrusion" growing on the left side of my lower back.  It has been surgically removed three times, but continues to reoccur. I've suffered severe back pain for the last 25 years.  Recently I found a new pain management doctor, who has actually studied my problem (gasp/ a real doctor who wants to know WHY I hurt, instead of one telling me that I don't hurt at all). New x-rays I had done last week show that the "bony protrusion" is actually the L6 vertebrae, and it is growing sideways to the left.  It is a huge plate of bone that has actually partially fused with my illium (hip bone).  It appears that I have broken this bone multiple times during the normal course of daily motion.  It explains why my pain is so very intense at times that I can't breathe, and why after about 2 months I feel better for a while.  Then it seems to break again, at the place where it wants to grow to the illium.  Then I have two broken bone edges that rub against each other until they begin to knit again.  And then it breaks again. My doctor doesn't know how to fix this.  He is contacting surgeons, but not having any luck so far. Has this happened to anyone else?  If so, was it fixed?  How? At this point I am living my life on pain pills which only help a little.  I am in almost constant pain and now afraid to do simple things like walk or sweep a floor. Any help or suggestions would be most appreciated.  I would be happy to provide links to the X-rays if it would help.  (I'll get them scanned or something, just let me know).

Approximately 10% of adults have some kind of spinal cord anomaly.  Some 2-3% of the population (depending on the race) have a 13th thoracic vertebrae (made infamous because of the 13th rib that God took from Adam to make woman).  Some people have "cervical ribs".  One of the most common spinal anomaly is a 6th lumbar vertebrae.  It rarely causes back problems except when it is fused with the sacrum ( Source ).    This sacralization does cause pain, as you describe.  Most doctors initially try to treat this conservatively with steroid injections.  Surgery may be necessary.  Wise.

If anyone doubts that great pain results from this condition, he/she is WRONG.  I have had terrible pain since I was "jarred" in a wreck about a year and half ago.  The only relief that I seem to get is to lie in bed for a day or two after trying to maintain a normal routine for the rest of the days of any given week. I would appreciate any input from anybody out there regarding this situation.  I hope that this isn't all that I have to look forward to from now on since I'm only 38 right now.

Congenital vertebral anomaly   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search     Congenital anomalies of spine    Classification and external resources    ICD - 10  Q67.5 , Q76 .0-.4    ICD - 9-CM  756.1     [ edit on Wikidata ]     Congenital vertebral anomalies are a collection of malformations of the spine . Most around 85% are not clinically significant, but they can cause compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability. This condition occurs in the womb. Congenital vertebral anomalies include alterations of the shape and number of vertebrae .     Contents    1  Lumbarization and sacralization  2  Hemivertebrae  3  Block vertebrae   3.1  Fossil record  3.2  Gallery    4  Butterfly vertebrae  5  Transitional vertebrae  6  Spina bifida  7  Associations  8  References     Lumbarization and sacralization [ edit ]     Lumbarization of sacral vertebra 1 , seen as 6 vertebrae that do not connect to ribs .    Lumbarization is an anomaly in the spine . It is defined by the nonfusion of the first and second segments of the sacrum . The lumbar spine subsequently appears to have six vertebrae or segments, not five. This sixth lumbar vertebra is known as a transitional vertebra. Conversely the sacrum appears to have only four segments instead of its designated five segments. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae consist of the process of the last lumbar vertebra fusing with the first sacral segment. [1] While only around 10 percent of adults have a spinal abnormality due to genetics, a sixth lumbar vertebra is one of the more common abnormalities. [2]     Sacralization of the L5 vertebra is seen at the lower right of the image.    Sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra (or sacralization ) is a congenital anomaly , in which the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra (L5) fuses to the sacrum on one side or both, or to ilium , or both. These anomalies are observed at about 3.5 percent of people, and it is usually bilateral but can be unilateral or incomplete (ipsilateral or contralateral rudimentary facets) as well. Although sacralization may be a cause of low back pain , it is asymptomatic in many cases (especially bilateral type). Low back pain in these cases most likely occurs due to chronic faulty biomechanics. In sacralization, the L5-S1 intervertebral disc may be thin and narrow. This abnormality is found by X-ray .  Sacralization of L6 means L6 attaches to S1 via a rudimentary joint. This L6-S1 joint creates additional motion, increasing the potential for motion-related stress and lower back pain/conditions. This condition can usually be treated without surgery, injecting steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation instead. Additionally, if L6 fuses to another vertebra this is increasingly likely to cause lower back pain. [3] The presence of a sixth vertebra in the space where five vertebrae normally reside also decreases the flexibility of the spine and increases the likelihood of injury. [4]  Hemivertebrae [ edit ]  Hemivertebrae are wedge-shaped vertebrae and therefore can cause an angle in the spine (such as kyphosis , scoliosis , and lordosis ). Among the congenital vertebral anomalies, hemivertebrae are the most likely to cause neurologic problems. [5] The most common location is the mid thoracic vertebrae , especially the eighth (T8). [6] Neurologic signs result from severe angulation of the spine, narrowing of the spinal canal, instability of the spine, and luxation or fracture of the vertebrae. Signs include rear limb weakness or paralysis, urinary or fecal incontinence, and spinal pain. [5] Most cases of hemivertebrae have no or mild symptoms, so treatment is usually conservative. Severe cases may respond to surgical spinal cord decompression and vertebral stabilization. [6] Associations Recognised associations are many and include: Aicardi syndrome , cleidocranial dysostosis , gastroschisis 3, Gorlin syndrome , fetal pyelectasis 3, Jarcho-Levin syndrome , OEIS complex , VACTERL association . [7]  The probable cause of hemivertebrae is a lack of blood supply causing part of the vertebrae not to form. Hemivertebrae in dogs are most common in the tail, resulting in a screw shape.  Block vertebrae [ edit ]  Block vertebrae occur when there is improper segmentation of the vertebrae, leading to parts of or the entire vertebrae being fused. The adjacent vertebrae fuse through their intervertebral discs and also through other intervertebral joints so that it can lead to blocking or stretching of the exiting nerve roots from that segment. It may lead to certain neurological problems depending on the severity of the block. It can increase stress on the inferior and the superior intervertebral joints. It can lead to an abnormal angle in the spine, there are certain syndromes associated with block vertebrae; for example, Klippel–Feil syndrome . The sacrum is a normal block vertebra.  Fossil record [ edit ]  Main article: Paleopathology  Evidence for block vertebrae found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists , specialists in ancient disease and injury. A block vertebrae has been documented in T. rex . This suggests that the basic development pattern of vertebrae goes at least as far back as the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and mammals . The tyrannosaur's block vertebra was probably caused by a "failure of the resegmentation of the sclerotomes ." [8]  Gallery [ edit ]         Block vertebrae of the cervical spine (vertebrae 4 and 5). Probably based on degenerative or inflammatory changes.           Several congenital block vertebrae in the transition from the thoracic to the lumbar spine and hemivertebrae.           Congenital block vertebra in the lumbar spine (partial vertebrae 3 and 4). The rear portion of the disc still exists.           Congenital block vertebra of the lumbar spine. CT volume rendering.           Congenital block vertebra of the lumbar spine. CT volume rendering.      Butterfly vertebrae [ edit ]  Butterfly vertebrae have a sagittal cleft through the body of the vertebrae and a funnel shape at the ends. This gives the appearance of a butterfly on an x-ray . It is caused by persistence of the notochord (which usually only remains as the center of the intervertebral disc ) during vertebrae formation. There are usually no symptoms. There are also coronal clefts mainly in skeletal Dysplasias such as Chondrodysplasia punctata. In dogs, butterfly vertebrae occur most often in Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers. [9]         Butterfly vertebra (red). Normal vertebra for comparison (blue).           Volume rendering of a CT scan of the lumbar vertebral column, showing butterfly vertebrae at several levels, most typically in L1.      Transitional vertebrae [ edit ]     Short ribs at the first lumbar vertebra, which is thus a transitional vertebra, since lumbar vertebrae normally do not have ribs attached to them.    Transitional vertebrae have the characteristics of two types of vertebra. The condition usually involves the vertebral arch or transverse processes . It occurs at the cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbosacral junction. For instance, the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra may resemble a rib. A transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction can cause arthritis , disk changes, or spinal cord compression. Back pain associated with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) is known as Bertolotti's syndrome . One study found that male German Shepherd Dogs with a lumbosacral transitional vertebra are at greater risk for cauda equina syndrome , which can cause rear limb weakness and incontinence. [10]  Spina bifida [ edit ]  Spina bifida is characterized by a midline cleft in the vertebral arch. It usually causes no symptoms in dogs. It is seen most commonly in Bulldogs and Manx cats. [5] In Manx it accompanies a condition known as sacrocaudal dysgenesis that gives these cats their characteristic tailless or stumpy tail appearance. It is inherited in Manx as an autosomal dominant trait.

            Is There Such A Thing As An Extra Lumbar Vertebra?    Read more       New Reply    Follow     New Topic   Followed by 1 people                                     healthfreak8816991  over a year ago    I recently paid a visit to the ER because I hurt my back.  I learned that I had a 6th lumbar vertebrae.  The doctor said that this is most likely the cause of my lower back pain.  I 've read many things that said this shouldn't cause lower back pain and I've read many things that said it does.  I learned that only about 10%-15% of the population has this "anamoly."  My questions: Does anyone else have this? If so, do you have lower back pain that radiates into your legs? How have you dealt with the pain?  I have requested an MRI.  I think I have a herniated disk.  I fit almost all of the symptoms for it.  It hurts to sit in most positions.  It hurts to cough and sneeze.  It hurts to bend my neck down--as if in a praying position.  It hurts to lift my legs while sitting.  This has been going on since December '07.  Anyone else experienced any of this?  Any input or advice is appreciated!!  Thanks!!  --LinZ                Loading...                  jillybean86633  over a year ago    I just recently was diagnosed with two herniated disks and I have all the same symptoms you describe above.   I also have a "lumbarization of the S1" or an extra "6th" lumbar vertebra.  I've also heard conflicting messages about whether or not it causes pain, but I've had a nagging pain that comes and goes for about 4 years now.  I haven't been able to lay comfortably on my stomach since 2004 and I believe my pain has been caused by that extra vertebra.  I'm otherwise healthy and should have no other reason for low back pain!   the pain that radiates into your legs is from the herniated disk pushing on nerve roots that exit your spinal cord.  I've dealt with the pain with lots of rest (don't sit!) and alternating between ice packs and a heating pad.  I've also started seeing a chiropractor which I found helps tremendously!  I start decompression therapy this week too, which is a surgical alternative approved by the FDA and boasts a phenomenally high success rate.  You may find some relief from over the counter pain medicines, but unfortunately for me those did not do the trick.  I've been taking vicodin every night to be able to sleep for a month now.  Don't be afraid to ask for stronger pain meds if over the counter stuff doesnt work...no need to suffer and you definitely need good rest and good sleep to heal!  I would recommend seeing a chiropractor and looking into decompression therapy...good luck! feel better soon!

I actually was seeing a chiropractor for my neck--it was out of alignment--but when I told him about my back pain, all he did was used this little clicky thing that hurt and left bruises on my back and did not help at all.  What type of chiropractor do you see?  Just a "normal" one?  Mine specialized in the field of Atlas Orthogonal (sp?).  I will definitley look into decompression therapy.  I'm a nursing major and just really can't and don't have any down time.  I've started seeing a physical therapist but I've only been once and it was not very productive.  I go back today.  I hope it goes a little better this time.  Again, thank you for your reply!!  --LinZ     Reply                 Loading...             jillybean86633  over a year ago    that little clicky thing is called an actuator (I think) and I'm having it used on my back right now too, because the chiro doesnt want to adjust my back in the traditional way since I'm using the decompression treatment and my ligaments and such will be much more loose during the therapy.  and yeah, it does hurt a little bit...but when I first started getting traditional adjustments for my disks, those hurt too.  I'm about 3 weeks into it and it no longer hurts to get adjusted.  Perhaps your chiro was using the clicky thing because he did not want to put that much force onto a possibly herniated disk right away.  It's good to get an MRI so you can know exactly whats going on in there.  Unfortunately there really are no quick fixes and you have to do something (like adjustments and physical therapy) for a pretty long time before you can feel totally "normal".  I'm doing physical therapy, chiro adjustments and the decompression therapy 3 times a week for 8 weeks and I've felt relief after week one.  I do NOT want an epidural injection or a spinal fusion.  Those things are BAD news and seem to cause more problems for people than they fix.  I'm glad to hear you're going to therapy!  I actually work at a physical therapy office and the first visit you have usually isn't productive.  You have to work up to the level you would think you would be at when you start therapy.  You might even feel worse after the first few sessions!  While it may seem like you're not doing anything, the therapists know better and I've seen patients over exert themselves many times because they feel like they aren't doing anything and should be doing more.  Now that I've made the longest post ever...lol.  Stick with it! Be patient and you'll feel better before you know it!     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    Hi!!! first of all i have to apologize 'cause my english is not so good, i'm from mexico, i'm 22 years old... i have an extra lumbar vertebra too, i've discovered it when i was 14 because one day without a cause i had a lot of pain in my back, i couldn't walk, to stoop, to remain standing up, the only "confortable" position was in to bed (and believe me, not so much!). i went to the doctor and he told me about my extra vertebra, he injented me an analgesic and he said that i shouldn't be worry about it... two years later i had inconveniences again but i calm my pain with a simple medicine for back-pain named 'robaxisal' (metobarbamol & acetilsalisilic acid)... 1 year later i had pain again and i took another medicine strongest than robaxisal but i do not remember its name. I normally feel pain in my back when I use 'high shoes', when i'm gonna have my menstruation and when i load heavy things, also the doctor told me that i can to pacify the pain with regular exercises of 'column hygiene' like sleeping of side with a pillow between my legs and do some regular activities like sweeping  and things like that in different and better ways.  First of all i thought i was something like a phenomenon but now it is just part of my life, i've never had legs pain or somethig extra than my extra vertebra! =)  but i'm really worried about what willl happens when i get pregnant...  bye!!!

I visited the chiropractor only a few times during a 2 month period. Whatever discomfort I had continued and i realized whatever pain I was feeling could be relieved by a good massage. Today I have no pain issues to complain about. I am sure to stretch and workout regularly to keep strength and flexibility.     Reply                 Loading...

A few days ago (I'm 20 now), I found out I have a 6th vertebrae. The rheumatologist said that that would not be causing my pain at all, but he so no inflammation to indicate RA any longer but my back pain is very severe and radiates up both sides of my back now.     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    I am 33 male and have been off work for 6 months. I have a sacralized sixth vertebrea. I also have a spina bifida occulta at S1 plus a slight reversal of cervical lordosis (normal curve) at C5. I slipped a disc in my lower back and could not even walk. I have broken my hand three or four times and don't go to the doctor. usually handle pain in stride. I have been on pain pills the whole time. tried PT did not help. Went through a discogram where they put a needle into the disc and fill it with dye. worse then breaking bones or anything experienced to this point. The doctor tried for fourty minutes to get the needle into the bad disc. The other discs hurt a little and very uncomfortable but nothing like that one, by the time he was done pushing (very hard) to break the skin of the vertibrea I was just laying there shivering like a child. Nobody can tell me why the disc is so hard. Now they want to fuse the vertebrea. I feel there is more going on, when I first hurt it to look in the mirror you could see my spine curved dramatically now it is not as bad but still hve to sleep on the sofa the bed hurts it. Will be seen by second neurosergeon next month. The muscles in my back are as tight as they could be but after months of PT they are still the same. Just wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone thank you.     Reply                 Loading...

Guest  over a year ago    I found out i had an extra vertebrae when i was 9! after months of me and my mom complaining to the doctor about my back hurting, she then sent me to the hospital for X-rays.  I went to physiotherapy for over five years, and gave up because it hadn't helped the pain at all. My doctor says that she doesnt know what to suggest, and sometimes even accuses me of making up the fact that i'm in pain.  I'm 18 now and i've sort of learnt to live with the pain. My back constantly hurts and pain killers only make a mild difference. I just dont know what to do about it anymore.     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    When I was 29 I threw my back out after a) a snowboarding fall. b) the next day practicing splits during synchro. c) shoveling the wet snow after a huge February storm.  I couldn't walk at all, and my friend drove me to the doctor, I was crawling around my apartment.  The doctor gave me muscle relaxers, which helped, I could walk.  But it didn't really help.  I moved around like an old lady; I could barely stand up from sitting.  I went to the chiropractor, he x-rayed me, and asked how old I was again.  He explained to me that by the time we're 18 or 19 those "extra vertebrae" in the sancral region "fuse" together.  Mine never did, just like everyone else in this post. He explained my lower back will always be unstable due to this added spinal flexibility.  We have extra discs in there, too.  I spent weeks going to him and getting adjusted, and it's mostly worked.  I now do aerial dance, and constantly stretch myself, and my back has started hurting pretty bad again.  I remembered that in my twenties I'd go to yoga, and I never had any problems while I did that.  Tonight I went to a vinyasa flow yoga class, and it has been the first relief in weeks for my back.  I don't know if yoga can help everyone, especially people with herniated discs.  But maybe it might help some other people reading this.  I liken yoga class to giving yourself an internal massage, with the positions they have you stay in  and breathe through.  The stretching of the ligaments in the lower back from yoga seems to help a lot.  But I know I must stay with the yoga routine, or my back will start hurting again.  Good luck.

Lumbarization and Sacralization    Lumbarisation & sacralisation (Bertolotti's Syndrome)     Malformations of the base of the spine and pelvis are very common, with variations too numerous to describe. Being the seat of spinal movement, these structural anomalies subtly influence the free-flowing function of the spine as a whole. The two main congenital disorders go by the name of lumbarisation and sacralisation. In the 'modern' human skeleton the sacrum is a solid bony mass of 5 fused vertebrae at the back of the pelvis on which the upright spine sits. However, in earlier evolutionary forms the segments of the sacrum were not fused. They were free to move - like a tail - and participated as an extension of the spine in normal activity.  what is lumbarisation?    Lumbarization is where the first sacral segment is - at least partially - mobile instead of being part of the fused mass of the sacrum. It constitutes an 'extra' lumbar vertebra, often referred to as L6,    Lumbarization is where the uppermost segment of the sacrum is not fused. Rather it is free to move and participates, along with the neighbouring lumbar vertebrae in spinal activity. The first sacral segment is said to be lumbarised . With lumbarization, anatomists and clinicians have taken to referring to this additional mobile lumbar segment as an 'extra' vertebra, which has led to some confusion in the minds of the patients. There is no extra vertebra jammed into the length of the spine, simply an extra mobile vertebra and one less fixed one. This may be referred to as L6.   BUY NOW  what is sacralisation?  Sacralization is often described as having one fewer vertebra because the bottom lumbar segment (L5) is fused to the pelvis. It can either being fused to the sacrum below, or to the ilium at the side (the large ear-shaped bones of the pelvis) or both. Sacralisation with the sacrum can be termed central sacralisation, whereas to the sides it can be either uni- or bi-lateral transverse sacralisation. Being fused or semi-fused the L5 segment has more in common with its sacral neighbours than its (mobile) lumbar ones, hence it is said to be sacralised .  Central sacralisation may cause hypermobility - even instability - at the L4-S1 level above    With central sacralisation the vertebra may be solidly fused or there may be a slight degree of movement through the presence of a vestigeal L5 disc. It is well possible to get to advanced years being completely unaware that you have one less vertebra. Problems may only come to the fore when fitness levels diminish, particularly the strength of the abdominal muscles.  Bilateral sacralisation usually occurs through enlarged transverse processes either articulating with the pelvis, or fusing to it.     Unilateral partial sacralisation (Bertolotti's Syndrome) causes greater biomechanical disturbance than bilateral    Just to confuse matters, the vertebra in question is often not fused all the way across. It may be fused on one side but not the other. Its participation with spinal movement on one side only makes for very wonky movement and the other working lumbar links above have to cope with that. Where strain sets in there will be pain, often higher up the spine (see below).   what problems do lumbarization and sacralization cause?  It has always been assumed that congenital sacralization and lumbarization are clinically unimportant, but this may not be the case . Generally speaking, both anomalies of the sacrum and base of spine cause trouble, usually because of the incomplete nature of each. With lumbarisation, it is rare for this additional joint to be completely free. With sacralisation it's rare for it to be totally fused. The pure extreme of both is rarely found, rather a No Man’s Land in between.    Read more about this book  Readers' Reviews of Back in Action  BUY Back In Action   Sarah Key's iconic book, in print since 1986, discusses this topic in the section 'Do I Have An Extra Vertebra?'  The same is true of spines that are sacralised at the fifth lumbar segment. Although this segment is said to be mobile, in truth it's not usually free enough . Again this joint is neither fish nor fowl, and struggles to be part of everyday function of the spine. Invariably, this not-quite joint is not up to the task. Furthermore, its debility becomes more obvious with advancing years. Broadly speaking, a partially sacralised joint (with a some degree of movement) is more likely to develop symptoms, whereas a fully sacralised joint (that is fully fused) is usually pain-free but causes symptoms elsewhere at other joints - centrally at the level above and contra-laterally at both the same level and higher levels throughout the lumbar spine. This is described more fully below.  What is Bertolotti's Syndrome (BS) ?  Bertolotti's syndrome is low back pain caused by unilateral partial sacralisation where a pseudarthrosis, or developmental joint,  forms when a transverse process of L5 nudges permanently up against the bone of the pelvis.  The pain of BS is typically one-sided and felt where there is a 'bony hardness' at the top of the back of the pelvis. Unilateral partial sacralisation is the most problematic variant of the sacralisation syndrome as it results in a more complex one-sided disturbance of of the biomechanics through the base of the spine.  Leg length discrepancy may be implicated in bringing symptoms of partial sacralisation to the fore.  Pseudarthrosis (false joint) of small unilateral sacralisation    The pseudarthrosis develops where there is rubbing contact of the transverse process against the pelvis/sacrum. In another example of the miracle of the human body, it is complete with articular cartilage covering the bone and a joint capsule. For the most part, and certainly through youthful years, the pseudarthrosis  spares the body feeling pain, but with age, excessive sitting, high-impact sporting activities,  or a hyperextension injury, the joint  may become painful.  A high percentage if patients with unilateral sacralisatiuon develop degenerative disc disease at L5 and the L4 level above, caused by errant biomechanical forces through the spine at these levels.  Typical bilateral sacralisation pain    Other problems Associated with sacralisation  A fused unilateral sacralisation throws movement strain to the contralateral joint at the same level    Full-fusion unilateral sacralisation of the bottom lumbar segment has several knock-on effects. The first is excessive movement strain of the pseudarthrosis on the contralateral side. One treatment option is to surgically fuse the pseaudarthrosis (see below) although conservative mobilising and self-treatment techniques to make the false joint work better should be tried exhaustively first.  Unilateral fused sacralisation causes contralateral/cephalad movement strain at higher lumbar levels.    Unilateral sacralisation also tends to cause problems in the upper lumbar spine on the contralateral side. Typically, there are problems of the L2-3 spinal segment, usually involving the facet joint as well. The reason for this is not straightforward, although likely to be to do with the normal torque of functional spinal movement combined with the jarring strains on heel strike reverberating left and right through the spine on the way up.  The iliolumbar ligament makes L5 very stable.  By comparison, L4 is flimsy    Full fusion bilateral sacralisation commonly causes degenerative breakdown of the L4 disc above, related to the altered centre of gravity of the base of the spine. With the L5 fused to the sacrum, the seat of spinal movement is raised. L4 - the 'new' spinal base - lacks the secure shoring afforded L5 and this can lead overuse syndrome and developmental instability of the L4 segment. Normally, L5 sitting on the sacrum means the spine originates deep within the pelvis where it is firmly anchored by a three-dimensional array of very strong ligaments. The dense strands of the stellate (star-shaped) ligament fan out either side in robust semi-circles from the fifth lumbar vertebra to various parts of the the inner pelvic bones, lashing the spine securely to the sacral table.  Additional loading from bilateral sacralisation of L5 may cause instability at the L4 level above    For these reasons, treatment for lumbar sacralisation must always involve strengthening exercises of the muscles both front and back of the spine. The spinal intrinsic muscles (multifidus) must be re-educated to bolster the bending strength of L4 as the raised seat of spinal movement and you can see here about spinal strengthening and the Roman Chair . At the same time, stronger abdominal muscles help create a stronger retaining wall at the front. You can read all about the best abs exercises for bad backs here.

The term "congenital scoliosis" refers to a spinal deformity caused by vertebrae that are not properly formed. This occurs very early in development; in the first six weeks of embryonic formation. Congenital scoliosis does not seem to run in families. Genetic studies to date have not yielded much evidence that this condition can be inherited. Although congenital scoliosis is often discovered during the infant or toddler period, in some children it does not diagnosed until their adolescent years.  Pediatric spine surgeons describe congenital spinal anomalies based on which part of the vertebra is malformed or connected. Depending on the structure of the anomaly, the child may exhibit scoliosis (a curve to the right or left), kyphosis (round back), or lordosis (sway back). However, not all congenital anomalies fit neatly into these categories. There are often elements of more than one deformity, particularly scoliosis and kyphosis occurring together (Figure1).  Pediatric spine surgeons may refer to the spine anomaly as a "failure of segmentation." This means that one or more vertebrae are abnormally connected together on one side. This connection will slow growth on that side of the spine. Unopposed growth on one side with slowed growth on the other leads to a spinal deformity. "Failure of formation," the most common type of congenital problem, means that the normal shape of the vertebra is disrupted (Figure 2). "Failure of segmentation" means that the abnormal vertebrae did not separate properly. (Figure 3) On the x-ray these vertebra will look like triangles instead of rectangles. X-rays only show a two-dimensional representation of what is really a three-dimensional problem. The abnormally shaped vertebra may cause a wedge in the front, back, or either side, or a combination, tilting the spine at that level. Pediatric spine surgeons often use descriptive terminology to designate how much growth potential may be in the congenital anomaly. The term "fully segmented" indicates that there is a growth plate and a disk on both the top and bottom of the abnormal vertebra. "Semi-segmented hemi vertebrae" have a disk and growth plate either above or below. "Non-segmented hemi vertebrae" are fused to the vertebra above and below. Since non-segmented hemi vertebrae have no growth plates, the curves they cause are much less likely to progress than those due to semi-segmented hemi vertebrae, which are less likely to progress than a fully segmented hemi vertebra. A "block vertebra" means that there is a missing disk space. Block vertebrae essentially have no growth potential and therefore rarely cause a progressive deformity.

Killian, M.D.)    Figure 3: Defects of Segmentation A: Block vertebrae without scoliosis B: Multiple misshapen vertebrae fused on the opposite side with scoliosis C: Misshapen vertebra, unilateral bar, abnormal discs with scoliosis (Courtesy John T. Killian, M.D.)    In the thoracic (chest) part of the spine, congenital anomalies of the ribs often correspond with congenital anomalies of the vertebra. For example, an extra thoracic vertebra might attach to an extra rib. Vertebrae that are connected together may be associated with ribs that are connected together. The anomalies of the ribs and vertebrae are not always identical, but are often similar. A child with congenital spine anomalies often has more than one. This may be a congenital failure of formation on both the right and left sides of the spine or several grouped together or a mix of failure of formation and segmentation.  Figure 4: Three-dimension CT scan of the spine showing a hemi vertebra (partially formed vertebra) at T-12 and between L-2 and L-3 vertebrae  Evaluation  After the history and physical examination, the next step in evaluating congenital scoliosis is obtaining x-rays. X-rays of the neck should be taken to look for abnormal vertebrae in this region. The three-dimensional structure of the congenital anomaly may be best visualized on a CT scan with reconstruction (this study is usually done as part of a preoperative planning) (Figure 4) . An MRI is very valuable to characterize the congenital anomaly and to be certain that there are no associated anomalies of the spinal cord. In children younger than 3 months (before the vertebrae ossify and harden), an ultrasound examination can scan the spinal cord for abnormalities without the need for sedation. The evaluation of the congenital spine will also include an assessment of the kidneys and the heart Because the kidneys and heart are formed at the same time as the vertebrae, children with congenital scoliosis have a 25% chance of having an anomaly in the urologic system (kidneys, bladder) or a 10% chance in the cardiac system. The child's limbs should be examined for any musculoskeletal abnormalities, such as a clubfoot or malformed hand/arm.  Prognosis  When your child's congenital spine anomaly is first diagnosed, no one will know exactly how much the spine deformity will progress as the child grows. There are some clues, however. Anomalies in the thoracic spine tend to worsen with growth of the patient. Multiple fully-segmented hemi vertebrae on the same side of the spine also tend to progress with growth. A hemi vertebra opposite a set of fused vertebrae is the most likely combination to progress as the child grows. Because the most rapid period of spinal growth is in the first 5 years of life, and then at adolescence, these are the two times when the congenital curvature must be monitored most closely.  Observation  Observation is usually the first method of treatment for a young child with a spinal deformity. The physician will first need to determine if the curvature is progressing or worsening. Some children will have a curvature of their spine that is stable and unchanging, whereas other children will have a curve that relentlessly progresses. Just because the pediatric spine surgeon is "observing" your child does not mean that he/she is not treating them. During this period of time, not only will your child's doctor look for changes in the curve, but they will probably order some special tests to evaluate further the child's condition and have you see some other doctors.  Your pediatric spine surgeon will probably want to see your child every four to six months and have new x-rays made. They will then measure the curves and compare them with the previously made films. The doctor will probably continue to observe your child's curves as long as there is no drastic increase in the size of the curve. In some rare cases, the curve improves or even resolves. If your pediatric spine surgeon documents progression of the curve, though, a different form of treatment will need to be instituted. The surgeon will probably want to obtain bending radiographs of the spine to assess flexibility and help determine the next course of treatment.  Bracing  If the curve is progressive, and your child is still growing, the doctor will inform the parent of the lack of evidence that a brace or cast can prevent progression of a congenital scoliosis.  Surgery  An operation is sometimes necessary to address spinal deformity in the young child, and the decision to do these procedures is based on many factors. If the child's curve has shown progression despite bracing or casting, something will need to be done. The dilemma faced by the surgeon is how to stop the progression of a curve without adversely affecting future growth. Sometimes this is unavoidable, as most operations work by stopping abnormal spinal growth in a procedure called spinal fusion.  In Situ Spinal Fusion  Spinal fusion is a procedure performed to stop growth of the spine. It can be done from the back (posterior) or through the chest (anterior) or both. The joints of the spine are removed, and a bone graft is placed; when the bone heals there will be a fusion mass, or one solid piece of bone (Figure 1). The goal is for the many vertebrae of the spine to become one segment and stop growing crooked. In situ fusion means that the curve will be fused "where it is" with little or no correction of the spine. Sometimes instrumentation (rods, hooks, and screws) may be placed to help straighten the spine slightly and act as an internal brace for the bone graft that will form the fusion mass. When implants are not used, usually in young children, the child may need to wear a brace or cast following the operation.  The goal of an in situ spinal fusion is to address the problem early, before it becomes a serious deformity. For example, if a pediatric spine surgeon sees a child with a 40 o curve that has a poor prognosis (high chance to progress); he/she may elect to perform a limited spinal fusion to prevent the curve from getting any bigger. It is generally a safer procedure than those that correct the curvature of the spine. The results of a procedure to correct the curve at a young age can be unpredictable, as continued growth of the spine in other areas can cause the curve to progress or rotate (twist around).  Figure 1A: The exposed congenital scoliosis deformity is prepared for the fusion. Figure 1B: The bone graft has been added to create a fusion of the deformed vertebrae. Postoperatively, the patient will be immobilized in a cast. (John T. Killian, MD)  Hemi-epiphysiodesis  This surgical procedure is aimed at stopping abnormal growth on one side of the spine with the hope that continued growth on the other side will result in correction of the curve over time. Every curve has a concave and convex side. If the growth centers are removed and spinal fusion is performed on the convex side, the concave side might continue to grow, possibly improving the curve. As noted, these procedures can be unpredictable in young children with abnormal vertebrae in their back.  Hemi Vertebra Resection  Some young children with scoliosis may have abnormally shaped vertebrae in their back that causes the curve. Normal vertebrae are shaped like rectangles. A hemi vertebra is shaped like a triangle or trapezoid. When this hemi vertebra is located at the bottom of the spine it can tilt the base of the spine and cause the child lean to one side. In other parts of the spine, depending on the number of hemi vertebrae present, severe deformity can develop. Depending on your child's situation, this hemi vertebra may be removed from the front, back, or both parts of the spine. Once the hemi vertebra is removed the vertebrae above and below it are fused together, often with instrumentation. Most children will wear a brace or cast after the operation until the spine heals. This operation has inherent risks involved; including bleeding and neurologic injury, but good spinal correction is often achieved.  Growing Rods  Most operations that address spinal deformity in the young child work by stopping growth. This may have unfavorable effects on growth of the thorax, lung development, and size of the trunk. The theory of the growing rod operation is to allow for continued controlled growth of the spine. This is done through the back of the spine. In general, the curve is spanned by one or two rods under the skin to avoid damaging the growth tissues of the spine. The rods are then attached to the spine above and below the curve with hooks or screws. The curve can usually be corrected by fifty percent at the time of the first operation. The child then returns every six months to have the rods "lengthened" approximately one centimeter to keep up with the child's growth. This is usually an outpatient procedure performed through a small incision. Most children will have to wear a brace to protect the instrumentation. When the child becomes older and the spine has grown, the doctor will remove the instrumentation and perform a formal spinal fusion operation. In the past, this procedure had a very high complication rate, most of which were related to the instrumentation (hook dislodgement, rod breakage). Newer techniques are more promising but treatment with growing rods remains a long, difficult therapy for the child.  VEPTR Treatment  Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, a newly characterized disease, is defined as the inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth. The thorax, which includes the spine, the rib cage, and the sternum, is the engine of respiration. It must have adequate volume for the underlying lungs to grow and it must be able to change that volume for breathing (respiration) to occur.  Thoracic insufficiency syndrome plays a part in the development of a child in two distinct ways. The first is the inability to support normal respiration. A thorax in early stages of deformity from scoliosis or from fused or absent ribs may have a minor degree of inhibition of respiration and the patient may appear normal. As the deformity worsens, the respiration can become more labored with increase respiratory rate and the inability to keep up with playmates in play activities. When thoracic volume is severely decreased and the diaphragm is the sole source of respiratory effort, then children may need aides such as nasal oxygen, BiPap ( pressure mask delivering oxygen), or even ventilator support to maintain life sustaining oxygen levels in their blood. The second component of thoracic insufficiency syndrome is the inability of the thorax to support lung growth. Early in life, a small thorax may be adequate for an infant, but if the child grows without the thorax enlarging with normal growth sufficiently to accommodate adult size lungs, then by the time the patient becomes a teenager, the thorax that was adequate during early childhood is very inadequate for adult oxygenation needs.  In thoracic insufficiency syndrome, the three-dimensional deformity of the thorax can limit its important role as a respiratory engine. Diseases can affect the spine and rib cage in many different ways, but the common problems are deficiencies in thoracic volume, symmetry, and function.  Most of the work of breathing is accomplished by the work of the diaphragm muscle, which is the thin muscle at the base of the thorax underneath the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thorax increases with the air brought into the lungs. When the diaphragm muscles relax, air is forced out of the lungs. Another important contribution to the act of breathing is the outward expansion of the chest wall itself from the many small muscles between the ribs. For the thorax to have optimal efficiency as a respiratory pump, it must have ideal volume for age, the ribs need to have a symmetrical shape in order for them to move properly, and the diaphragm muscle must be properly anchored at the base of the chest. In congenital scoliosis, there can be missing or fused ribs. When there is an absence of ribs, the underlying lung collapses inward with breathing without effectively expanding. In fused ribs and congenital scoliosis, the concave side of the curve usually contains a lung constricted by the fused ribs. Additional loss of thoracic volume may be seen in scoliosis when the curve rotates the spine into the chest on the convexity of the curve, often protruding deeper into the chest in a deformity called lordosis (sway back), flattening the chest with loss of thoracic volume. In this instance, the ribs cannot move well enough to contribute to respiration, and breathing becomes totally dependent on the diaphragm muscle. Increasing deformity of the thorax results in greater volume loss and may lead to respiratory problems to a point that a child may require oxygen or even ventilator support.  Recently, a new surgical technique termed "expansion thoracoplasties" with the vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR or "titanium rib") device, have been approved by the FDA to treat the combined thoracic deformity (spine/rib cage) by enlarging the constricted chest and straightening the spine indirectly without a spine fusion. Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR) expansion thoracoplasty was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of thoracic insufficiency syndrome in skeletally immature patients. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) is usually associated with uncommon three-dimensional deformities of both the spine and rib cage. Several types of VEPTR based expansion thoracoplasties operations can be used for different types of deformities to gain chest volume for growth of the underlying lungs while indirectly correcting the scoliosis without spine fusion. (Figure 6) VEPTR surgery is extensive, devices are placed under the scapula (shoulder blade) and are attached to the ribs near the neck and continue down to either the spine, or the ribs near the waist, this helps to stabilize the surgically expanded chest wall constriction (expansion thoracoplasty). To accommodate later growth, the devices are expanded twice a year in outpatient surgery through small incisions. Currently, there are a limited number of institutions offering VEPTR surgery. Your child's spine surgeon can advise whether your child's condition is appropriate for VEPTR treatment and provide referral information, if needed. Some centers are using the VEPTR device as a means to straighten the spine indirectly via the ribs and chest wall.  Figure 1A: The mid thoracic spine multiple hemi vertebrae have produced a severe scoliosis Figure Figure 1B: VEPTR surgery has used 2 rods to stabilize the severe congenital scoliosis (Courtesy of Kit Song, MD)  Instrumentation and Fusion  Definitive spinal fusion is performed to stop growth of the spine and thus achieve permanent correction. This treatment becomes appropriate when the patient has demonstrated significant evidence of progression of the congenital scoliosis.  Posterior fusion provides permanent stabilization in the corrected position and is achieved by removing the joints between the vertebrae to be fused, usually all the vertebrae which are involved in the curve. Bone graft - either from the pelvis, ribs, or from the bone bank (allograft) - is placed in each joint space which has been removed. Over time (4-6 months), the graft incorporates to the vertebral bone, and the operated portion of the spine heals into a solid block of bone which cannot bend, thus eliminating further progression of the curve. Typically in a child who has reached an appropriate age for definitive fusion, instrumentation will also be placed when the fusion is performed. The instrumentation rigidly fixes the spine internally, so that the corrected position is carefully preserved while the fusion takes place over the 4-6 month period. This rigid fixation is achieved by screws, hooks, and wires ("anchors") attached to the spine, usually at multiple sites along the curve, and then rods are attached to the anchors to stiffen the entire area (Figure 1) . Depending on the flexibility of the curve and any preceding treatment (such as traction), there may be additional correction of the deformity achieved by the application of the instrumentation. However, the primary goal of the surgery is to stop the curve from progressing further, and thus be the definitive stabilization - additional correction is an added benefit but not the primary concern. Often the patient does not need any further external immobilization (cast or brace) if the internal fixation device is felt to be adequate at the time of surgery.

However, some people possess an additional lumbar vertebra located below the L5. This extra vertebra, known as the L6, is called a transitional vertebra. About 10 percent of adults have some form of spinal abnormality caused by genetics and a sixth lumbar vertebra is among the most common of these abnormalities. Read on to learn about spinal conditions that affect the L6 vertebra, along with treatments for the associated symptoms.  Spinal conditions affecting the L6-S1  More often than not, the existence of an L6 does not contribute directly to troublesome spinal conditions. In fact, this vertebra is subject to the same potentially debilitating conditions most people experience at the L5 level. Another difference is the way doctors refer to conditions associated with this transitional vertebra. Rather than speak of it in terms of the L5 to L6 level, it is generally referred to as the L6 to S1 level — denoting an association with the sacral region just below the lumbar vertebrae .  Occasionally, the L6 vertebra can become sacralized, which means it is attached to the sacrum by a rudimentary joint that creates additional motion. Therefore, a greater potential for motion-related stress can lead to lower back pain. Other conditions that affect this vertebra include a herniated disc, a bulging disc, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis, which can occur at any level of the spine.  Treatment for L6 conditions  Doctors who discover the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra through the use of an MRI, X-ray or CT scan are likely to prescribe the same type of conservative treatments for chronic pain management as they would for someone without an L6. These methods of treatment include pain medication, physical therapy, behavior modification and more. Occasionally, conservative treatment proves ineffective and a doctor might suggest seeing if you are a candidate for surgery, such as the minimally invasive procedures offered at Laser Spine Institute.  The outpatient procedures at Laser Spine Institute lead to shorter recovery times and safer and effective alternatives when compared to traditional open spine operations.^ By using a less than 1-inch incision and muscle-sparing techniques, our procedures result in less bleeding and a lower risk of complication than traditional surgery.^ Our minimally invasive procedures are performed on an outpatient basis and have helped more than 75,000 patients find relief from chronic neck and back pain.

Verkuilen, APNP     |   Peer Reviewed                 Spine surgeons and radiologists (who both may read and interpret MRI scans) sometimes differ in their method of labeling a particular spinal segment. This creates confusion - among both patients and insurance companies - triggering the question: "Where is the problem?"  A Sixth Lumbar Vertebra  Lumbar Spine Anatomy Video  One of the reasons for the confusion is that some people, approximately 10% of adults, have a congenital anomaly in their lower back. One of the most common anomalies is the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra. Having one extra lumbar vertebra provides no advantage or disadvantage to the individual and is rarely a cause of back problems, but it can create some confusion. For example:   Radiologists commonly count down from the last rib when numbering the lumbar vertebral bodies.  Surgeons on the other hand, count up from the sacrum when numbering the lumbar vertebrae.   Neither method of labeling lumbar vertebrae is incorrect, but obviously it can create confusion.  For an individual with 5 vertebral bodies, they would be in agreement when labeling the L4-L5 level. If the individual has 6 lumbar vertebrae, however, the radiologist would typically refer to the lowest level as L6-S1 and the level above that L5-L6, which in the surgeon's mind, would be correctly labeled L4-L5.  Article continues below       It is obviously very important to clearly identify the location of lumbosacral anomalies in order to avoid injection or surgical exposure of the incorrect level. This becomes particularly important for minimally invasive procedures. A physical exam and complementary imaging studies, such as an MRI scan and X-ray, can help improve the accuracy and the communication of the diagnosis.

However, anomalies such as these in the lumbar spine and sacral spine are simply variants of normal bony architecture and are typically of no consequence. In other words, it would be very rare for an abnormality such as a sixth lumbar vertebra or extra bone in the sacrum to cause back problems.  Article continues below       The one exception to this general guideline is in cases where the last transverse process (a bony protrusion near the vertebra) is partially attached to the sacrum, or "sacralized". If this bony protrusion is attached to the sacrum, it can create a rudimentary joint (pseudoarticulation) where there shouldn't be one. The resulting motion in this section of the spine can sometimes be a cause of localized low back pain. This condition can usually be successfully treated without surgery. For instance, an injection of steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation of the transverse process and the sacrum can often be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

Main Document The human spinal cord consists of nerves that connect the brain to nerves in the body. It is a superhighway for messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The spinal cord is surrounded for most of its length by the bones (vertebrae) that form the spine. The outer layer of the human spinal cord consists of white matter, i.e., myelin-sheathed nerve fibers. These are bundled into specialized tracts that conduct impulses triggered by pressure, pain, heat, and other sensory stimuli or conduct motor impulses activating muscles and glands. The inner layer, or gray matter, is mainly composed of nerve cell bodies. Within the gray matter, running the length of the cord and extending into the brain, lies the central canal through which the cerebrospinal fluid circulates.  How Long is the Spinal Cord?   The human spinal cord, part of the central nervous system, is around 45 cm (18 in) in men and around 43 cm (17 in) long in women. The spinal cord has a varying width, ranging from 13 mm (1/2 in) thick in the cervical and lumbar regions to 6.4 mm (1/4 in) thick in the thoracic area. Your spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column (spinal column or backbone).   How Many Bones Make Up the Human Spine?   The human spinal column is made up of 33 bones - 7 vertebrae in the cervical region, 12 in the thoracic region, 5 in the lumbar region, 5 in the sacral region and 4 in the coccygeal region.   What is the Difference Between Vertebrates and Invertebrates?   Vertebrates have a backbone or a spinal column.  Invertebrates do not have a backbone or a spinal column.   What is the Difference Between Vertebra and Vertebrae?   Vertebra = Singular  Vertebrae = Plural   What is an SCI?   A spinal cord injury (SCI) can occur anywhere along the spinal cord. It is the result of damage to cells in the spinal cord and causes a loss of communication between the brain and the parts of the body below the injury. Effects of a SCI may include low blood pressure, inability to regulate blood pressure effectively, reduced control of body temperature, inability to sweat below the level of injury, and chronic pain.       Spinal Cord Injury Information on Vertebra C1 to S5    Jump To:   Cervical (C1 - C8)  Thoracic (T1 - T12)  Lumbar (L1 - L5)  Sacral (S1 - S5)    C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8  T1  T2  T3  T4  T5  T6  T7  T8  T9  T10  T11  T12  L1  L2  L3  L4  L5  S1  S2  S3  S4  S5     C1 to C5 Spinal Vertebra Information      Most severe of the spinal cord injury levels.  C2 to C3 - Usually fatal as a result of inability to breathe.  Requires 24 hour a day assistance.  Paralysis in arms, hands, trunk and legs.  Will not be able to drive a car on their own.  Ability to speak is sometimes impaired or reduced.  If both arms and legs are affected, this is called tetraplegia or quadriplegia.  May be able to use powered wheelchairs with special controls to move around on their own.  Patient may not be able to breathe on his or her own, cough, or control bowel or bladder movements.  Requires complete assistance with activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, bathing, and getting in or out of bed.          Cervical (neck) Injuries (C1 to C8)    C1 - Atlas - The Atlas is the topmost vertebra, and along with C2, forms the joint connecting the skull and spine. Its chief peculiarity is that it has no body, and this is due to the fact that the body of the atlas has fused with that of the next vertebra.     C2 - Axis - Forms the pivot upon which C1 rotates. The most distinctive characteristic of this bone is the strong odontoid process (dens) which rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body. The body is deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and front part of the third vertebra. Injuries to C-1 and C-2 can result in a loss of many involuntary functions including the ability to breathe, necessitating breathing aids such as ventilators or diaphragmatic pacemakers.    C3 - Injury to spinal bone three often causes pain, tingling, and sometimes numbness in the arms, neck, and head. If the fourth cervical vertebrae (C4) nerve root is also involved, pain is usually felt in the upper arms and shoulders, as well as the lower neck.    C4 - Cervical Vertebra - Quadriplegia and breathing difficulty - The fourth cervical (neck) vertebra from the top. Injuries above the C-4 level may require a ventilator for the person to breathe properly.    C5 - Quadriplegia with some shoulder and elbow function - 5th cervical vertabrae down from the base of the skull, found in the neck. C5 injuries often maintain shoulder and biceps control, but have no control at the wrist or hand.  C5 to C8 injuries - Corresponding nerves control the arms and hands, a person with this level of spinal injury may still be able to breathe on their own and speak normally.      C6 - Cervical Vertebra - Quadriplegia with shoulder, elbow, and some wrist function - The sixth cervical (neck) vertebra from the top. The next-to-last of the seven cervical vertebrae. An injury to the spinal cord between C6 and C7 vertebrae is called a C6-7 injury. These injuries generally allow wrist control, but no hand function.    C7 - Vertebra Prominens - Quadriplegia with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and some hand function - The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process, hence the name vertebra prominens. In some subjects, the seventh cervical vertebra is associated with an abnormal pair of ribs, known as cervical ribs. These ribs are usually small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing unpleasant symptoms. C-7 and T-1 can straighten their arms but still may have dexterity problems with the hand and fingers. Injuries at the thoracic level and below result in paraplegia, with the hands not affected.    C8 - Quadriplegia with normal arm function; hand weakness - Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there are eight cervical nerves (C1-C8). All nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while the C8 nerve emerges below the C7 vertebra. In other words C8 is a nerve root not a vertebrae.        Thoracic Vertebrae (T1 to T12)    The thoracic vertebrae increase in size from T1 through T12 and represent the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae are situated between the cervical (neck) vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae. These thoracic vertebrae provide attachment for the ribs and make up part of the back of the thorax or chest. Damage or SCI's above the T1 vertebra affects the arms and the legs. Injuries below the T1 vertebra affect the legs and trunk below the injury, but usually do not affect the arms and hands. Paralysis of the legs is called paraplegia . Paralysis of the arms AND legs is called quadriplegia . The most common fractures of the spine occur in the thoracic (midback) and lumbar spine (lower back) or at the connection of the two (thoracolumbar junction). These fractures are typically caused by high-velocity accidents, such as a car crash, or a fall from height.   T1 to T6 - Paraplegia with loss of function below mid-chest; full control of arms  T1 to T8 - Most often control the hands, but poor trunk control as the result of lack of abdominal muscle control.  T6 to T12 - Paraplegia with loss of function below the waist; good control of torso  T9 to T12 - Allow good trunk control and abdominal muscle control. Lumbar and Sacral injuries yield decreasing control of the hip flexors and legs. Individuals with SCI also experience other changes. For example, they may experience dysfunction of the bowel and bladder.  Corresponding nerves affect muscles, upper chest, mid-back and abdominal muscles.   T1 to T5 Thoracic Nerves   Can learn to drive a modified car.  Arm and hand function is usually fairly normal.  Will most likely need to use a manual wheelchair.  Injuries usually affect the trunk and legs (paraplegia).  Can stand with the use of a standing frame, some patients may walk with braces   T6 to T12 Thoracic Nerves   Nerves affect muscles of the trunk (abdominal and back muscles) depending on the level of injury.  Usually results in paraplegia.  Normal upper-body movement.  Can learn to drive an adapted vehicle.  Most likely will need to use a manual wheelchair.  Should be able to cough productively (if abdominal muscles are intact).  A fair to good ability to control and balance the body while in a seated position.  Some patients will be capable of standing in a standing frame, while others may require the use of braces to walk.  Often will have little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder function but can usually manage on their own with adaptive equipment.      T1 - Comparatively speaking, T1 is the smallest of all thoracic vertebrae. The T1 vertebra is the first (uppermost) of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae that make up the central and largest section of the spinal column between the lumbar vertebrae below and the cervical vertebrae above.    T2 - The second vertebra in the thoracic spine is responsible for helping to support the rib cage. The T2 vertebra possesses facets that create joints with two of the ribs, thus helping to keep the thoracic spine far more stable than the cervical spine in the neck or the lumbar spine in the lower back. T2 vertebra degeneration include: Herniated, bulging or prolapsed discs, Bone spurs, Facet disease, Forms of osteoarthritis and Traumatic or sports-related injuries.    T3 - The third thoracic vertebrae is a small vertebra in the upper middle back that plays an integral role in supporting the rib cage. The anterior aspect of the upper thoracic spine is a difficult region to approach in spinal surgery.    T4 - Spinal cord transection at T4 results in severe damage of the nervous tissue, with impairment of motor, sensory and autonomic functions. T4 syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition in which spinal injury at the T4 vertebra causes a set of symptoms including diffuse arm pain and pins and needles or numbness in the upper arm.    T5 - The T5 vertebra, as well as the rest of the thoracic spine, provides a stable foundation for the human rib cage.    T6 - An injury at the level of T6 (thoracic) spinal cord results in damage to the autonomic nervous system, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, affecting the function of major abdominal organs.    T7 - The T7 vertebra is in the middle of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae of the torso and the center of the spinal column. Thoracic vertebrae play an important role, not only in the protection of the spinal cord, but also in the protection of vital organs. A vertebral compression fracture refers to a break of the vertebral body, most often below the T7 level of the thoracic spine (upper back), and is most commonly caused by weakened bone resulting from osteoporosis. Most vertebral compression fractures result in a loss of more than 15% to 20% of the height of the vertebra.    T8 - T8 vertebra is toward the lower (caudal) end of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae within the central, torso section of the spine. Like other spinal vertebrae, the T8 primarily protects and encases the spinal cord. The T8 is also at the same level as the xiphoid process. The eighth thoracic spinal nerve runs beneath the T8. Throughout the thoracic spine, discs like those above and beneath the T8 vertebra can become damaged and cause painful symptoms.    T9 - T9 to T12 are known as the transition vertebrae. The lumbar cord is situated between T9 and T11 vertebrae. T9 to T12 injuries can be classified as either complete or incomplete injuries. Complete injuries result in the total loss of movement and sensation below the point of injury, while incomplete injuries indicate that some function below the level of injury is retained.    T10 - T10 is situated at the umbilicus. The T10 vertebra is near to the bottom of the twelve (12) thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12) within the torso and making up the central portion of the spinal column. This particular vertebra has a complete articular facet and the thoracic spinal nerves passes out under it. T10 innervates the muscles of the lower abdomen. It is part of the section of the spinal cord which is most vulnerable to injury due to the area's high level of flexibility. An injury in this area will most likely experience limited or complete loss of use of the muscles in the lower abdomen, buttocks, legs, and feet. Extent of disability is determined by damage done to the T10 vertebra. Partial damage may cause weakness, numbness, lack of muscle control, or loss of the use of one side of the lower body. Complete damage could result in the loss of use of the lower body (paraplegia).    T11 - The ribs connected to T11 and T12 at the bottom of the thoracic spine do not attach the sternum in front, but do provide protection for the kidneys in the back of the body. Because these levels have slightly less stability, they are slightly more prone to problems that can cause pain. A person with a T11 vertebral injury may have or recover sensations in the L1 through L4 dermatomes which include the front of the leg down to the mid-shin level. In addition, such a patient should recover hip extensors, knee extensors, and even ankle dorsiflexion. However, the sacral functions, including bowel and bladder and many of the flexor functions of the leg may be absent or weak.    T12 - T12 ends just above the hip girdle. T12 bears the most weight of any thoracic vertebra, making it the strongest thoracic vertebra, but also the most susceptible to stress-related injuries. Compression fractures of the spine usually occur at the bottom part of the thoracic spine (T11 and T12) and the first vertebra of the lumbar spine (L1). The most common thoracic spinal cord injury involves T11 and T12.        Lumbar Vertebrae (L1 to L5)    Lumbar nerves (L1 to L5) injuries generally result in some loss of function in the hips and legs. Often there is little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but patients usually manage on their own with the use of special equipment. Depending on strength in the legs, some patients may need a wheelchair and may also walk with braces. The lumbar vertebrae graduate in size from L1 through L5. These vertebrae bear much of the body's weight and related biomechanical stress. The lumbar vertebrae are also the largest segments of the movable part of the vertebral column, and are characterized by the absence of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process, and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body. Some individuals have four lumbar vertebrae, while others have six. Lumbar disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these individuals.     L1 - The first lumbar vertebra is at the same level as the ninth rib. This level is also called the important transpyloric plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level.    L2 - Injuries to the spinal column at L2 or lower will damage the tip of the spinal cord, called the conus, or the spray of spinal roots that are descending to the appropriate spinal vertebral levels to exit the spinal canal or the caudal equina.    L3 - The L3 vertebra is in the middle of the five lumbar vertebrae in the lower back portion of the spinal column. The L3 vertebra, or third lumbar vertebra, is one of the most common sites for the occurrence of a herniated disc and other spinal conditions that can cause chronic lower back pain. A lot of motion in the back is divided between these five motion segments with segments L3 - L4 and L4 - L5 taking most of the stress. L3 - L4 and L4 - L5 segments are most likely to breakdown from wear and tear causing such conditions as osteoarthritis. L2 and L3 cover the front part of the thighs.    L4 - The most likely to herniate. The effects of this can cause pain and numbness that can radiate through the leg and extend down to the feet (sciatica). Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are conditions that affect the moveable joints of the spine that help keep the vertebrae aligned one on top of the other. Spondylolysis is actually a weakness or stress fracture in one of the bony bridges that connects the upper and lower facet joints. This fracture can happen at any level of the spine but usually occurs at the fourth (L4) or fifth (L5) lumbar vertebra. L4 and L5 fractures are commonly the result of a high impact trauma from falls or motor vehicle accidents.    L5 - The fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) is the largest of the five lumbar vertebrae and is considered an atypical vertebra due to its shape. As the last of the lumbar vertebrae, the L5 vertebra bears more body weight than any of the other 23 vertebrae that sit atop it in the vertebral column. The L4 and L5 disc, in between the L4 and L5 vertebrae, can herniate or degenerate, leading to possible leg pain (sciatica) and/or lower back pain. The fifth lumbar vertebra is the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. Sacral Nerves (S1 to S5) injuries generally result in some loss of functionin the hips and legs. Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but patients can manage on their own with special equipment Most likely they will also still be able to walk.        Sacral Nerves (S1 to S5)    The sacrum is shaped different in males and females. In females the sacrum is shorter and wider than in males. The Sacrum is located behind the pelvis. Five bones (abbreviated S1 through S5) fused into a triangular shape, form the sacrum. The sacrum fits between the two hipbones connecting the spine to the pelvis located just below the lumbar vertebrae. The Sacrum consists of four or five sacral vertebrae in a child, which become fused into a single bone after age 26. The sacrum forms the back wall of the pelvic girdle and moves with it.  The first three vertebrae in the sacral have transverse processes which come together to form wide lateral wings called alae. These alae articulate with the blades of the pelvis (ilium).  As part of the pelvic girdle, the sacrum forms the back wall of the pelvis and also forms joints at the hip bone called the sacroiliac joints. The sacrum contains a series of four openings on each side through which the sacral nerves and blood vessels run. The sacral canal runs down the center of the sacrum and represents the end of the vertebral canal.  Back pain or leg pain ( sciatica ) can typically arise due to injury where the lumbar spine and sacral region connect (at L5 - S1) because this section of the spine is subjected to a large amount of stress and twisting.  People with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis are inclined to develop stress fractures and fatigue fractures in the sacrum.  The bottom of the spinal column is called the coccyx or tailbone. It consists of 3 to 5 bones that are fused together in an adult. Many muscles connect to the coccyx.  Sacral Nerves (S1 to S5) injuries generally result in some loss of function in the hips and legs. Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but can manage on their own with special equipment Most likely will be able to walk.     S1 -  L5 to S1 Isthmic Spondylolisthesis: A small fracture in the facet joints can allow the L5 vertebra to slip forward over the S1 vertebra, impinging the nerve root and leading to leg pain and other symptoms.  L5-S1 disc herniation: Occurs when the inner portion leaks out and touches the nearby nerve root, causing pain to radiate in the lower back and/or down the leg.  L5-S1 degenerative disc disease: If the L5-S1 disc is compromised, the L5-S1 disc itself can become a source of lower back and/or leg pain.      S2 - S2 is located at the level of posterior superior iliac spine. S2 covers the back of the thighs.    S3 - S3 cover the medial side of the buttocks.    S4 - S4-5 covers the perineal region.    S5 - S5 is the lowest dermatome and represents the skin immediately at and adjacent to the anus.

The 24 presacral vertebrae allow movementand hence render the vertebral column flexible. Stability is providedby ligaments, muscles, and the form of the bones. The abbreviations C.,T., L., S., and Co. are used for the regions, and these are sometimesfollowed by V. for vertebra or N. for nerve.  Curvatures.   The adult vertebral column presents four anteroposteriorcurvatures: thoracic and sacral, both concave anteriorly, and cervicaland lumbar, both concave posteriorly (fig. 39-1 ). Thethoracic and sacral curvatures, termed primary, appear during theembryonic period proper, whereas the cervical and lumbar curvatures,termed secondary, appear later (although before birth) and areaccentuated in infancy by support of the head and by the adoption of anupright posture.  Parts of a Vertebra.   A typical vertebra consists of (1) a body and (2) a vertebralarch, which has several processes (articular, transverse, and spinous)for articular and muscular attachments. Between the body and the archis the vertebral foramen: the sum of the vertebral foramina constitutesthe vertebral canal, which houses the spinal cord (fig. 39-2 ). Inaddition to the transverse and spinous processes, which serve as shortlevers, the 12 thoracic vertebrae are connected by joints with paired,long levers, namely the ribs.  The bodies of the vertebrae are separated from each other byintervertebral discs. The body is mainly spongy bone and red marrow,but the margins of the upper and lower surfaces consist of a ring ofcompact bone, the vertebral end-plates. The body is marked on its sidesby vascular foramina.  The vertebral arch consists of right and left pedicles (which connectit to the body) and right and left laminae. The transverse processesemerge laterally at the junction of the pedicles and laminae, and thespinous process proceeds posteriorly from the union of the laminae. Thesuperior and inferior articular processes project vertically from thevertebral arches on each side and bear articular facets. When vertebraare in their anatomical position, notches between adjacent pediclesform intervertebral foramina, each of which typically transmitsneuralstructures including a spinal ganglion and a ventral root of a spinalnerve.  Relationship of Spinal Nervesto Vertebrae.   The first cervical nerve emerges between the skull and theatlas, and cervical nerves C2 to 7 continue to leave the vertebralcanal above the correspondingly numbered vertebrae. C8 emerges betweenthe C7 and T1 vertebrae, and the remaining spinal nerves leave belowthe correspondingly numbered vertebrae.    Regional characteristics ofvertebrae  The vertebrae of each region have special characteristics, which arenow described.   Cervical Vertebrae.  The seven vertebrae of the neck are characterized by an opening in eachtransverse process known as a foramen transversarium. The upper sixpairs of foramina transversaria transmit the vertebral artery. The C1vertebra, which supports the skull, is termed the atlas, and C2, whichserves as a pivot for the atlas, is termed the axis.  Atlas (fig. 39-3 ).  The atlas (C1), which has neither body nor spinous process, consistsof two lateral masses connected by a short anterior and a longerposterior arch. Each lateral mass presents upper and lower facets, forthe occipital condyle of the skull and for the axis, respectively. Thetransverse processes are long and are vaguely palpable in vivoimmediately below the auricle. The anterior arch presents an anteriortubercle in front (for the anterior longitudinal ligament) and a facetposteriorly (for the dens of the axis). The posterior arch is groovedabove for the vertebral artery and the small C1 nerve on each side, andit presents a posterior tubercle behind.  Axis (fig. 39-4 ).  The axis (C2) is characterized by the dens (or odontoid process),which projects upward from the body and articulates with the anteriorarch of the atlas. The dens is anchored to the occipital bone (byapical and alar ligaments) and is limited behind by the transverseligament of the atlas (fig. 39-3 ). It is frequently claimed that the densrepresents the body of the atlas, but this is doubtful. *   Remaining cervical vertebrae(fig. 39-5 ).  The lower cervical vertebrae, C2 to 6 are typical and present short,bifid spinous processes. The bodies are small and oval in shape. Thereare superiorly-projecting lips at the superolateral borders of thevertebral bodies. These closely match indentations in the lateralborder of inferior aspect of the vertebral body above. Each transverseprocess, pierced by a foramen transversarium, ends laterally inanterior and posterior tubercles, which are connected by an"intertubercular lamella" or bar. # The bars are grooved by the ventral primary rami of the spinal nerves,which pass posterior to the foramina transversaria. The anteriortubercles of C6 vertebra are large and are termed the carotidtubercles, because the common carotid arteries can be compressedagainst them. C7 vertebra has a long, non-bifid spinous process and isknown as the vertebra prominens. (The spinous processes of C6 and 7 andT1 are usually visible in vivo when the neck is flexed.) The anteriortubercles (costal processes) of C7 vertebra may develop separately ascervical ribs. (Lumbar ribs are less frequent.)   Thoracic Vertebrae (figs. 39-5 , 39-6 and 39-7 ).  It should be noted that all vertebrae are dorsal, although only 12 arethoracic. The 12 vertebrae of the thorax bear the ribs. The T1 vertebra(like C.V.7) is transitional in appearance. T2 to 8 vertebra aretypical thoracic vertebrae with a kidney shaped body (fig. 39-5 ).Demifacets for the heads of the ribs (see fig. 20-3 ) arefound supeiorly and inferiorly at the junction of the body and pedicle.The transverse processes of T1 to 10 have costal facets for thetubercles of the ribs. The spinous processes are long, slender,and sloping: their tips lie opposite the subjacent body or even at thelevel of the intervertebral disc below the subjacent body. Thevarious facets for the ribs on T1 and on T9 to 12 veertebral bodies arearranged differently. T11 and 12 are transitional in form, i.e., partlyresembling lumbar vertebrae. A humped back is termed kyphosis.   Lumbar Vertebrae (figs. 39-8 and 39-9 ).  The five vertebrae between the thorax and sacrum are large and presentneither foramina transversaria nor costal facets (fig. 39-5 ). Thebody is kidney shpaed, and the pedicles and laminae are short andthick. The part of the lamina between the superior and inferiorarticular processes is known as the pars interarticularis and is liableto injury in some people (resulting in spondylolisthesis, i.e., aslipping forward of the body of one vertebra on the vertebra or sacrumbelow it). A mamillary process projects posteriorward from the superiorarticular process. The transverse process, which corresponds to a rib,is long and thin, and an accessory process may project inferiorwardfrom its root. The spinous processes are quadrilateral and projecthorizontally backward. The fifth lumbar vertebra, usually the largestvertebra, is mainly responsible for the lumbosacral angle (between thelumbar part of the column and the sacrum). Excessive "hollowing" of theback is termed lordosis.   Sacrum (figs. 39-10 and 39-11 ).  Five (sometimes six) vertebrae are fused in the adult to form thesacrum, which can be felt below the "small of the back." The sacrumarticulates above with L5, laterally with the hip bones, and inferiorlywith the coccyx. It has a roughly triangular appearance with a pelvicand dorsal surface, a lateral mass on each side, and a base and apex.The pelvic surface, concave and facing antero-inferiorly, presents fourpaired sacral foramina for the ventral primary rami of sacral nerves 1to 4. The dorsal surface, convex and facing posterosuperiorly, presentsa modified series of spinous processes termed the median sacral crestand four paired sacral foramina for the dorsal primary rami of sacralnerves 1 to 4. Below, the sacrum shows right and left sacral cornua,which bound a variable gap termed the sacral hiatus. An anesthetic forthe spinal nerves may be injected extradurally through the sacralhiatus (caudal analgesia). The cornua articulate with correspondinghorns on the coccyx. The lateral part or mass of the sacrum, lateral tothe sacral foramina, consists of the fused transverse processes(including their costal elements). Its superior surface is frequentlytermed the ala. The superolateral part of the lateral mass presents theauricular (ear-shaped) surface for articulation with the hip bone(sacro-iliac joint). The surface is limited behind by an area (sacraltuberosity) for interosseous ligaments. The base, formed by the supriorpart of the first sacral vertebra, presents a prominent anterior margintermed the promontory (fig. 39-11 ). Superior articular processes articulatewith the fifth lumbar vertebra. The sacral canal (which contains thedura, cauda equina, and filum terminale) extends from the base to thesacral hiatus. The apex of the sacrum may be fused with the coccyx.  Coccyx (fig. 39-10 ).  The vertebrae (usually four) below the sacrum are variably fused in theadult to form the coccyx, which resembles a miniature sacrum in shape.   Development of vertebrae(figs. 39-12 and 39-13 )  Vertebrae develop in mesenchyme and cartilage during the embryonicperiod proper, and most begin to ossify during fetal life. Typically, avertebra at birth shows three ossific areas, one for the centrum(defined in fig. 39-14 ) and one for each half of the neural arch.At about puberty, ossific centers appear in the margins of the upperand lower surfaces of the body (ring epiphyses) and at the tips of thevarious processes. Developmental failure of half a vertebra(hemivertebra) is one cause of lateral curvature (scoliosis).  Failure of fusion of the halves of one or more neural (futurevertebral) arches is termed spina bifida. The meninges alone(meningocele), or the spinal cord and meninges (meningomyelocele), mayprotrude through the defect (spina bifida cystica). When the defect isskeletal rather than neural, it may be concealed by the skin (althoughsometimes marked by a tuft of hair) and is termed spina bifida occulta.In the sacrum, this is quite common.   Surface anatomy   The spinous processes of the vertebrae are palpable in the medianfurrow of the back. The external occipital protuberance is palpable inadults. The spines of vertebrae C6, C7, and T1 are usuallyprominent and palpable, and they are made more conspicuous by flexionof the neck and trunk. In the thoracic region, the spinous processof each vertebra extends to the level of at least the body of thevertebra below. The inferior angle of the scapula is frequently at thelevel of the spinous process of T7. A horizontal plane between thehighest points of the iliac crests (supracristal plane) is usually atthe level of the spinous process of L4, and this is used as a landmarkfor lumbar puncture. A needle introduced here should enter thesubarachnoid space after 4 to 6 cm. The posterior superior iliac spineis commonly marked by a skin dimple (fig. 39-15 ).

Questions   39-1 How many vertebrae are movable? 39-1 The 24"presacral" vertebrae aremovable. Eighty-nine per cent of people have 24 presacral vertebrae, 6per cent have 23, and 5 per cent have 25 (P. E. Bomstein and R. R.Peterson, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 25:139-146, 1966).    39-2 Which curvatures first appear in thevertebral column? 39-2 The thoracic andsacral curvaturesareprimary (appearing during embryonic life). The cervical and lumbarcurvatures are secondary (appearing during fetal life and accentuatedduring infancy).    39-3 How many processes characterize avertebral arch? 39-3 A typicalvertebral arch ischaracterized by at least seven processes: four articular, twotransverse, and one spinous. Lumbar vertebrae have small, additional(mamillary and accessory) processes. The axis has an odontoid process(the dens) but no superior articular processes (merely facets). Theatlas has only transverse processes.    39-4 Where are the intervertebral foraminaand what do they contain? 39-4 Theintervertebral foramina arebetween adjacent pedicles, and typically each contains a spinalganglion and a ventral root (or rootlets) of a spinal nerve (see fig. 41-3 ).    39-5 Between which vertebrae does the C8nerve emerge? 39-5 C8 nerve rootemerges between C7 andT1 vertebrae. Hence the remaining spinal nerves below leave inferior tothe correspondingly numbered vertebrae.    39-6 What are the key features of thecervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae? 39-6 The key featuresof cervical,thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae are, respectively, foraminatransversaria, articulation with ribs, absence of both of the abovefeatures, and fusion.    39-7 How many dorsal vertebrae are presentin the body? 39-7 All 33 vertebraeare dorsal. Twelveare thoracic.    39-8 What is the pars interarticularis? 39-8 The parsinterarticularis, visibleonoblique radiographs of the lumbar vertebrae (see fig. 39-9 ), isthe part of the neural arch between the superior and inferior articularprocesses. The slipping forward of a vertebral body (e.g., L5) istermed spondylolisthesis (Gk, vertebral slipping) and usually involvesfracture at the pars interarticularis. Case Report. A 50-year-old nursecomplained of numbness of the right big toe, a burning pain down thelateral side of the right leg and foot, bowel and bladder problems, andweakness of the lower limbs. She developed a marked depression over thespinous process of L5. At operation, spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1 wasfound, with defective partes interarticulares of L5 and protrusion ofthe L4/5 disc. The leg pains were caused by compression of L5 nerveroots from alterations of the L5/S1 facets. Bowel and bladderdifficulties were produced by compression of the cauda equina fromgross distortion of the vertebral canal. Decompression by removal ofsome bone near the pedicles relieved the symptoms (G. Austin, TheSpinal Cord, Thomas, Springfield, Illinois, 1961). Numerous casestudies on anatomy have been described by E. Lachman (Case Studies inAnatomy, 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1981) and also byL. K. Schneider (Anatomical Case Histories, Year Book, Chicago, 1976).    39-9 What are the chief contents of thesacral canal? 39-9 The sacral canalcontains the dura,cauda equina, and filum terminale. Above S2, a subarachnoid space isalso present (see fig. 41-1 ).    39-10 What is the ossific status of atypical vertebra at birth? 39-10 At birth, atypical vertebra showsthree primary ossific areas, one for the centrum and one for each halfof the neural arch. (The centrum does not correspond to the whole ofthe body: see fig. 39-14 .) The three primary areas become united bybone in early childhood (3 to 6 years). A number of secondary centers(the ring epiphyses and centers for the tips of the transverse andspinous processes) appear at about puberty.    39-11 How is surgical access to thespinal cord achieved? 39-11 Surgical accessto the spinal cordand nerve roots is achieved by sectioning the laminae (laminectomy) oneach side of several vertebrae.    39-12 What is spina bifida? 39-12 Spina bifida isa developmentalanomaly in which the halves of one or more neural (future vertebral)arches have failed to fuse. The spinal cord and meninges(myelomeningocele), or the meninges alone (meningocele), may protrudethrough the defect (spina bifida cystica). When the defect is skeletalrather than neural, it is termed spina bifida occulta; this defect isfound in the sacrum in approximately one fifth of the generalpopulation (A. C. Berry, J. Anal., 120:519,1975), although theincidence is minute in certain peoples (J. I. Levy and C. Freed, J.Anal., 114:449, 1973).    39-13 Which Latin and Greek roots areused with reference to the vertebral column? 39-13 The Latin rootsspino- andvertebro-are used with reference to the vertebral column (e.g., inspinotransverse and vertebrocostal). Greek roots with a similarsignificance are spondyl- and rhachi- (e.g., in spondylolisthesis andrachischisis, the latter meaning "vertebral cleft" and used for an openspina bifida, especially one that extends along many vertebrae).

The superior aspect of the lateralpart is the ala.  Figure 39-12 Scheme of horizontal sections of vertebrae, showing what are thought tobe corresponding parts. Note that the costal element forms a part ofthe transverse process of a cervical vertebra. It forms the rib in thethoracic region, most of the transverse process in the lumbar region,and the greater portion of the lateral part of the sacrum. In thecervical vertebra, the posterior tubercle of the transverse processshould probably also be shaded as part of the costal element.  Figure 39-13 Variations in vertebrae. B shows the common arrangement. In A, "cranialshift," a cervical rib articulates with C7 and rib 12 is small. In B,L5 is partially "sacralized" and S5 is partially freed. In C, "caudalshift," rib 12 is large and a small lumbar rib is present. S1 vertebrais partially "lumbarized" and Co.1 is incorporated into the sacrum.(After Schinz et al.)  Figure 39-14 The neural arch and centrum (left half of figure), and the vertebralarch and body (right half). The terms centrum and neural arch refer tothose parts of a vertebra ossified from primary centers. The termsvertebral arch and body are descriptive terms generally applied toadult vertebrae. The body of a vertebra includes the centrum and partof the neural arch. The vertebral arch, therefore, is less extensivethan the neural arch. Note that the rib articulates with the neuralarch and not with the centrum.  Figure 39-15 Some surface landmarks of the back. (From Royce, L Surface Anatomy,Davis, Philadelphia, 1965,)   * See F.

Maybe you've even become something of an expert. If so, you know that there are five vertebrae in the lumbar region of the spinal cord , the portion of the spine that curves in your lower back. But like many biological “facts,” there are exceptions to every rule.   Sixth lumbar vertebrae in your spine are uncommon, but far from extraordinary. About 10% of the population has an extra bone in this region, and while additional vertebrae don't typically affect your health, they can complicate treatment for spinal cord injuries.  A Sixth Vertebrae?  The sixth vertebra is typically located just below L5, making it the lowest vertebra and positioning it next to your tailbone. The extra bone is essentially just a harmless anomaly; sometimes it's because one vertebra failed to fuse with another, but in other cases it's unclear why the bone appeared. L6 vertebrae don't grow overnight. If you have the condition, you've always had it. In the overwhelming majority of people, this condition causes no symptoms .  Learn the full anatomy of the spine by downloading the: Simplified Guide to Understanding a Spinal Cord Injury.    How an Extra Bone Affects Spine Health  An L6 vertebra is not, in and of itself, cause for concern, and most people go through their entire lives without even knowing they have the condition. However, this additional bone can complicate spinal health in some situations.  Doctors sometimes vary the direction they count when identifying spinal structures, and the presence of an additional bone can cause them to give the wrong number; a doctor who doesn't know your condition might label your bottommost lumbar vertebra L5 when it is in fact L6.  Rarely, the L6 vertebra becomes fused to another vertebra, causing back pain. This portion of the spine is also vulnerable to bulging or herniated discs. And because there is an additional bone fitted into the space of five vertebrae, the presence of an L6 can decrease the flexibility of the spine. Lastly, if your spinal cord injury is very low, it might affect your L6 vertebrae.   Will an Extra Vertebrae Affect Spinal Cord Injury Treatment?  A sixth lumbar vertebra should not affect treatment for your spinal cord injury though you should ensure that every physician who treats you knows about the condition. This ensures no one inaccurately counts to the wrong portion of your spine.  An additional vertebra does not increase the odds of suffering a spinal cord injury since the additional vertebra is in essentially the same spot as L5. Moreover, injuries to this vertebrae are unlikely to cause complete immobility since the injury is so low. Pain from this area, due to fusion to another vertebra, may worsen symptoms of a spinal cord injury. If you experience new or worsening symptoms, be sure to notify your doctor.

However, some people possess an additional lumbar vertebra located below the L5. This extra vertebra, known as the L6, is called a transitional vertebra. About 10 percent of adults have some form of spinal abnormality caused by genetics and a sixth lumbar vertebra is among the most common of these abnormalities. Read on to learn about spinal conditions that affect the L6 vertebra, along with treatments for the associated symptoms.  Spinal conditions affecting the L6-S1  More often than not, the existence of an L6 does not contribute directly to troublesome spinal conditions. In fact, this vertebra is subject to the same potentially debilitating conditions most people experience at the L5 level. Another difference is the way doctors refer to conditions associated with this transitional vertebra. Rather than speak of it in terms of the L5 to L6 level, it is generally referred to as the L6 to S1 level — denoting an association with the sacral region just below the lumbar vertebrae .  Occasionally, the L6 vertebra can become sacralized, which means it is attached to the sacrum by a rudimentary joint that creates additional motion. Therefore, a greater potential for motion-related stress can lead to lower back pain. Other conditions that affect this vertebra include a herniated disc, a bulging disc, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis, which can occur at any level of the spine.  Treatment for L6 conditions  Doctors who discover the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra through the use of an MRI, X-ray or CT scan are likely to prescribe the same type of conservative treatments for chronic pain management as they would for someone without an L6. These methods of treatment include pain medication, physical therapy, behavior modification and more. Occasionally, conservative treatment proves ineffective and a doctor might suggest seeing if you are a candidate for surgery, such as the minimally invasive procedures offered at Laser Spine Institute.  The outpatient procedures at Laser Spine Institute lead to shorter recovery times and safer and effective alternatives when compared to traditional open spine operations.^ By using a less than 1-inch incision and muscle-sparing techniques, our procedures result in less bleeding and a lower risk of complication than traditional surgery.^ Our minimally invasive procedures are performed on an outpatient basis and have helped more than 75,000 patients find relief from chronic neck and back pain.

Verkuilen, APNP     |   Peer Reviewed                 Spine surgeons and radiologists (who both may read and interpret MRI scans) sometimes differ in their method of labeling a particular spinal segment. This creates confusion - among both patients and insurance companies - triggering the question: "Where is the problem?"  A Sixth Lumbar Vertebra  Lumbar Spine Anatomy Video  One of the reasons for the confusion is that some people, approximately 10% of adults, have a congenital anomaly in their lower back. One of the most common anomalies is the presence of a sixth lumbar vertebra. Having one extra lumbar vertebra provides no advantage or disadvantage to the individual and is rarely a cause of back problems, but it can create some confusion. For example:   Radiologists commonly count down from the last rib when numbering the lumbar vertebral bodies.  Surgeons on the other hand, count up from the sacrum when numbering the lumbar vertebrae.   Neither method of labeling lumbar vertebrae is incorrect, but obviously it can create confusion.  For an individual with 5 vertebral bodies, they would be in agreement when labeling the L4-L5 level. If the individual has 6 lumbar vertebrae, however, the radiologist would typically refer to the lowest level as L6-S1 and the level above that L5-L6, which in the surgeon's mind, would be correctly labeled L4-L5.  Article continues below       It is obviously very important to clearly identify the location of lumbosacral anomalies in order to avoid injection or surgical exposure of the incorrect level. This becomes particularly important for minimally invasive procedures. A physical exam and complementary imaging studies, such as an MRI scan and X-ray, can help improve the accuracy and the communication of the diagnosis.  In This Article:     Understanding Back Problems    Normal Spinal Anatomy    Radiculopathy, Radiculitis and Radicular Pain   Spinal Abnormalities Rarely Cause Back Problems   Spine Anatomy Interactive Video      When Spinal Anomalies Cause Back Problems  Patients are sometimes told that a spinal anomaly - such as a sixth lumbar vertebrae or an extra sacral bone - has been found on an X-ray and is causing their back problems. However, anomalies such as these in the lumbar spine and sacral spine are simply variants of normal bony architecture and are typically of no consequence. In other words, it would be very rare for an abnormality such as a sixth lumbar vertebra or extra bone in the sacrum to cause back problems.  Article continues below       The one exception to this general guideline is in cases where the last transverse process (a bony protrusion near the vertebra) is partially attached to the sacrum, or "sacralized". If this bony protrusion is attached to the sacrum, it can create a rudimentary joint (pseudoarticulation) where there shouldn't be one. The resulting motion in this section of the spine can sometimes be a cause of localized low back pain. This condition can usually be successfully treated without surgery. For instance, an injection of steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation of the transverse process and the sacrum can often be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

Have you studied this at all and do you know how it might affect the spinal cord and nerve roots?  I guess I'm just curious as this kind of thing fascinates me.  I was born with two extra fingers, so I'm a bit of a mutant myself. They had tiny fingernails, but no bone or apparent muscle, so both were 'tied off' after birth.  My younger brother was born with one extra, and my folks were told if they had any more kids they would like be 'polydactyl' as well.  Too bad I wasn't born with a redundant CNS like a Klingon.  OK, my geekiness is starting to show, so I'll shut up now.  ~Rus  "Because you're not promised tomorrow." ~ Stuck Mojo             Reply With Quote              10-12-2001, 11:28 PM    #2        Wise Young    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message    View Blog Entries    Visit Homepage    View Articles       Administrator       Join Date  Jul 2001  Location  New Brunswick, NJ, USA  Posts  38,593          Rus,  Very interesting.  A number of people (I was not able to identify a reliable source of the incidence of such an occurrence) have a 13th rib, usually from L1 vertebra.  This is often associated with a 6th lumbar vertebra.  Such an extra vertebra is sometimes called a transitional vertebra.  Accordin to the following web site   http://www.vh.org/Providers/Textbook...Vertebrae.html  the incidence of a transitional vertebra is 4.2% in a very large series of skeletons (4200).  Also, lumbosacral transitional vertebrae vary by race.      Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae were found to vary by race. It was reported that they were present in 18% of Australian aboriginals (Mitchell), 16% of Indians (Bustami), 10% of Arabs (Bustami), 8.1% of natives of Britain (Brailsford), and 5.8% of Japanese (Toyoda). Bustami studied 340 sacra of two population groups (Arab and Indian). Of these 340 sacra, 32 or 9.4% showed evidence of unilateral sacralization and 14 or 4.1% showed bilateral sacralization. Lumbarization was no found in the 340 sacra examined. Sacralization was present to some degree in 46 specimens (13.5%). The incidence of total sacralization was 10% in Arab and was 16% in Indian population groups. Arab males had a higher incidence in all stages of sacralization while it was the Indian females that showed the higher incidence in their group.   You may be interested to find that while the homo sapien is characterized by having five lumbar vertebra but homo erectus (the first of the human skeletons found in Africa, including Lucy and australopithecus africanus skeletons) typically had 6 lumbar vertebra.  The presence of a 13th rib is of passing interest from the point of view of the Bible which suggests that God made Eve from the 13th rib of Adam.   http://www.angelfire.com/mi/dinosaurs/erectus_ribs.html  Animals generally have more vertebra than humans.  For example, most animals have 12-15 thoracic vertebrae and 6-7 lumbar vertebrae although some whales may have as many as 20 lumbar vertebrae.  Cows have 13 thoracic and 6 lumbar vertebrae.  Pigs have 13-17 thoracic vertebrae and 5-7 lumbar vertebrae.  Sheep have 13-14 thoracic vertebrae and 6 to 7 lumbar vertebrae.  In contrast, almost all mammals have 7 cervical vertebrae, including human.  http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/skeleton.html  Wise             Reply With Quote              10-13-2001, 12:28 PM    #3        cheesecake    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message    View Blog Entries    View Articles       Moderator       Join Date  Aug 2001  Location  USA  Posts  7,535        Co-joined nerves    Can you explain what co-joined nerve roots are? I was told it is a congenital defect but had no awareness of it until my injury. It showed on the MRI and is part of the reason I did not have the type of recovery and the motor and sensory loss was greater. Is this uncommon or something that people have but are never aware of until a problem arises?

These include co-joined roots where one or more roots, instead of each coming out separate through the appropriate opening of the spinal column, join and come out in the wrong opening.  I am no t sure why this should change the recovery from spinal cord injury.  Several anomalies of the spinal column are very well known to increase the risk of spinal cord injury.  The most prominent of these is stenosis of the cervical or lumbar canal, where t he space in which the spinal cord resides is narrowed.  Football players who have stenosis are more likely to get paralysis when hit.  Do you have scoliosis?  This also predisposes to spinal cord injury.  Interestingly, for reasons that are not well-under stood, scoliosis is much more common in females than males.  Scoliosis is also associated with a high incidence of tethering of the spinal cord which predisposes to greater risk and severity of spinal cord injury.

It was discovered after I was in a terrible auto accident 25 years ago.  Since that time, I have had a "bony protrusion" growing on the left side of my lower back.  It has been surgically removed three times, but continues to reoccur. I've suffered severe back pain for the last 25 years.  Recently I found a new pain management doctor, who has actually studied my problem (gasp/ a real doctor who wants to know WHY I hurt, instead of one telling me that I don't hurt at all). New x-rays I had done last week show that the "bony protrusion" is actually the L6 vertebrae, and it is growing sideways to the left.  It is a huge plate of bone that has actually partially fused with my illium (hip bone).  It appears that I have broken this bone multiple times during the normal course of daily motion.  It explains why my pain is so very intense at times that I can't breathe, and why after about 2 months I feel better for a while.  Then it seems to break again, at the place where it wants to grow to the illium.  Then I have two broken bone edges that rub against each other until they begin to knit again.  And then it breaks again. My doctor doesn't know how to fix this.  He is contacting surgeons, but not having any luck so far. Has this happened to anyone else?  If so, was it fixed?  How? At this point I am living my life on pain pills which only help a little.  I am in almost constant pain and now afraid to do simple things like walk or sweep a floor. Any help or suggestions would be most appreciated.  I would be happy to provide links to the X-rays if it would help.  (I'll get them scanned or something, just let me know).

Approximately 10% of adults have some kind of spinal cord anomaly.  Some 2-3% of the population (depending on the race) have a 13th thoracic vertebrae (made infamous because of the 13th rib that God took from Adam to make woman).  Some people have "cervical ribs".  One of the most common spinal anomaly is a 6th lumbar vertebrae.  It rarely causes back problems except when it is fused with the sacrum ( Source ).    This sacralization does cause pain, as you describe.  Most doctors initially try to treat this conservatively with steroid injections.  Surgery may be necessary.  Wise.

If anyone doubts that great pain results from this condition, he/she is WRONG.  I have had terrible pain since I was "jarred" in a wreck about a year and half ago.  The only relief that I seem to get is to lie in bed for a day or two after trying to maintain a normal routine for the rest of the days of any given week. I would appreciate any input from anybody out there regarding this situation.  I hope that this isn't all that I have to look forward to from now on since I'm only 38 right now.

Congenital vertebral anomaly   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search     Congenital anomalies of spine    Classification and external resources    ICD - 10  Q67.5 , Q76 .0-.4    ICD - 9-CM  756.1     [ edit on Wikidata ]     Congenital vertebral anomalies are a collection of malformations of the spine . Most around 85% are not clinically significant, but they can cause compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability. This condition occurs in the womb. Congenital vertebral anomalies include alterations of the shape and number of vertebrae .     Contents    1  Lumbarization and sacralization  2  Hemivertebrae  3  Block vertebrae   3.1  Fossil record  3.2  Gallery    4  Butterfly vertebrae  5  Transitional vertebrae  6  Spina bifida  7  Associations  8  References     Lumbarization and sacralization [ edit ]     Lumbarization of sacral vertebra 1 , seen as 6 vertebrae that do not connect to ribs .    Lumbarization is an anomaly in the spine . It is defined by the nonfusion of the first and second segments of the sacrum . The lumbar spine subsequently appears to have six vertebrae or segments, not five. This sixth lumbar vertebra is known as a transitional vertebra. Conversely the sacrum appears to have only four segments instead of its designated five segments. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae consist of the process of the last lumbar vertebra fusing with the first sacral segment. [1] While only around 10 percent of adults have a spinal abnormality due to genetics, a sixth lumbar vertebra is one of the more common abnormalities. [2]     Sacralization of the L5 vertebra is seen at the lower right of the image.    Sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra (or sacralization ) is a congenital anomaly , in which the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra (L5) fuses to the sacrum on one side or both, or to ilium , or both. These anomalies are observed at about 3.5 percent of people, and it is usually bilateral but can be unilateral or incomplete (ipsilateral or contralateral rudimentary facets) as well. Although sacralization may be a cause of low back pain , it is asymptomatic in many cases (especially bilateral type). Low back pain in these cases most likely occurs due to chronic faulty biomechanics. In sacralization, the L5-S1 intervertebral disc may be thin and narrow. This abnormality is found by X-ray .  Sacralization of L6 means L6 attaches to S1 via a rudimentary joint. This L6-S1 joint creates additional motion, increasing the potential for motion-related stress and lower back pain/conditions. This condition can usually be treated without surgery, injecting steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation instead. Additionally, if L6 fuses to another vertebra this is increasingly likely to cause lower back pain. [3] The presence of a sixth vertebra in the space where five vertebrae normally reside also decreases the flexibility of the spine and increases the likelihood of injury. [4]  Hemivertebrae [ edit ]  Hemivertebrae are wedge-shaped vertebrae and therefore can cause an angle in the spine (such as kyphosis , scoliosis , and lordosis ). Among the congenital vertebral anomalies, hemivertebrae are the most likely to cause neurologic problems. [5] The most common location is the mid thoracic vertebrae , especially the eighth (T8). [6] Neurologic signs result from severe angulation of the spine, narrowing of the spinal canal, instability of the spine, and luxation or fracture of the vertebrae. Signs include rear limb weakness or paralysis, urinary or fecal incontinence, and spinal pain. [5] Most cases of hemivertebrae have no or mild symptoms, so treatment is usually conservative. Severe cases may respond to surgical spinal cord decompression and vertebral stabilization. [6] Associations Recognised associations are many and include: Aicardi syndrome , cleidocranial dysostosis , gastroschisis 3, Gorlin syndrome , fetal pyelectasis 3, Jarcho-Levin syndrome , OEIS complex , VACTERL association . [7]  The probable cause of hemivertebrae is a lack of blood supply causing part of the vertebrae not to form. Hemivertebrae in dogs are most common in the tail, resulting in a screw shape.  Block vertebrae [ edit ]  Block vertebrae occur when there is improper segmentation of the vertebrae, leading to parts of or the entire vertebrae being fused. The adjacent vertebrae fuse through their intervertebral discs and also through other intervertebral joints so that it can lead to blocking or stretching of the exiting nerve roots from that segment. It may lead to certain neurological problems depending on the severity of the block. It can increase stress on the inferior and the superior intervertebral joints. It can lead to an abnormal angle in the spine, there are certain syndromes associated with block vertebrae; for example, Klippel–Feil syndrome . The sacrum is a normal block vertebra.  Fossil record [ edit ]  Main article: Paleopathology  Evidence for block vertebrae found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists , specialists in ancient disease and injury. A block vertebrae has been documented in T. rex . This suggests that the basic development pattern of vertebrae goes at least as far back as the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and mammals . The tyrannosaur's block vertebra was probably caused by a "failure of the resegmentation of the sclerotomes ." [8]  Gallery [ edit ]         Block vertebrae of the cervical spine (vertebrae 4 and 5). Probably based on degenerative or inflammatory changes.           Several congenital block vertebrae in the transition from the thoracic to the lumbar spine and hemivertebrae.           Congenital block vertebra in the lumbar spine (partial vertebrae 3 and 4). The rear portion of the disc still exists.           Congenital block vertebra of the lumbar spine. CT volume rendering.           Congenital block vertebra of the lumbar spine. CT volume rendering.      Butterfly vertebrae [ edit ]  Butterfly vertebrae have a sagittal cleft through the body of the vertebrae and a funnel shape at the ends. This gives the appearance of a butterfly on an x-ray . It is caused by persistence of the notochord (which usually only remains as the center of the intervertebral disc ) during vertebrae formation. There are usually no symptoms. There are also coronal clefts mainly in skeletal Dysplasias such as Chondrodysplasia punctata. In dogs, butterfly vertebrae occur most often in Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers. [9]         Butterfly vertebra (red). Normal vertebra for comparison (blue).           Volume rendering of a CT scan of the lumbar vertebral column, showing butterfly vertebrae at several levels, most typically in L1.      Transitional vertebrae [ edit ]     Short ribs at the first lumbar vertebra, which is thus a transitional vertebra, since lumbar vertebrae normally do not have ribs attached to them.    Transitional vertebrae have the characteristics of two types of vertebra. The condition usually involves the vertebral arch or transverse processes . It occurs at the cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbosacral junction. For instance, the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra may resemble a rib. A transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction can cause arthritis , disk changes, or spinal cord compression. Back pain associated with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) is known as Bertolotti's syndrome . One study found that male German Shepherd Dogs with a lumbosacral transitional vertebra are at greater risk for cauda equina syndrome , which can cause rear limb weakness and incontinence. [10]  Spina bifida [ edit ]  Spina bifida is characterized by a midline cleft in the vertebral arch. It usually causes no symptoms in dogs. It is seen most commonly in Bulldogs and Manx cats. [5] In Manx it accompanies a condition known as sacrocaudal dysgenesis that gives these cats their characteristic tailless or stumpy tail appearance. It is inherited in Manx as an autosomal dominant trait.

            Is There Such A Thing As An Extra Lumbar Vertebra?    Read more       New Reply    Follow     New Topic   Followed by 1 people                                     healthfreak8816991  over a year ago    I recently paid a visit to the ER because I hurt my back.  I learned that I had a 6th lumbar vertebrae.  The doctor said that this is most likely the cause of my lower back pain.  I 've read many things that said this shouldn't cause lower back pain and I've read many things that said it does.  I learned that only about 10%-15% of the population has this "anamoly."  My questions: Does anyone else have this? If so, do you have lower back pain that radiates into your legs? How have you dealt with the pain?  I have requested an MRI.  I think I have a herniated disk.  I fit almost all of the symptoms for it.  It hurts to sit in most positions.  It hurts to cough and sneeze.  It hurts to bend my neck down--as if in a praying position.  It hurts to lift my legs while sitting.  This has been going on since December '07.  Anyone else experienced any of this?  Any input or advice is appreciated!!  Thanks!!  --LinZ                Loading...                  jillybean86633  over a year ago    I just recently was diagnosed with two herniated disks and I have all the same symptoms you describe above.   I also have a "lumbarization of the S1" or an extra "6th" lumbar vertebra.  I've also heard conflicting messages about whether or not it causes pain, but I've had a nagging pain that comes and goes for about 4 years now.  I haven't been able to lay comfortably on my stomach since 2004 and I believe my pain has been caused by that extra vertebra.  I'm otherwise healthy and should have no other reason for low back pain!   the pain that radiates into your legs is from the herniated disk pushing on nerve roots that exit your spinal cord.  I've dealt with the pain with lots of rest (don't sit!) and alternating between ice packs and a heating pad.  I've also started seeing a chiropractor which I found helps tremendously!  I start decompression therapy this week too, which is a surgical alternative approved by the FDA and boasts a phenomenally high success rate.  You may find some relief from over the counter pain medicines, but unfortunately for me those did not do the trick.  I've been taking vicodin every night to be able to sleep for a month now.  Don't be afraid to ask for stronger pain meds if over the counter stuff doesnt work...no need to suffer and you definitely need good rest and good sleep to heal!  I would recommend seeing a chiropractor and looking into decompression therapy...good luck! feel better soon!     Reply                 Loading...                  healthfreak8816991  over a year ago    Thank you for your reply!!  I actually was seeing a chiropractor for my neck--it was out of alignment--but when I told him about my back pain, all he did was used this little clicky thing that hurt and left bruises on my back and did not help at all.  What type of chiropractor do you see?  Just a "normal" one?  Mine specialized in the field of Atlas Orthogonal (sp?).  I will definitley look into decompression therapy.  I'm a nursing major and just really can't and don't have any down time.  I've started seeing a physical therapist but I've only been once and it was not very productive.  I go back today.  I hope it goes a little better this time.  Again, thank you for your reply!!  --LinZ     Reply                 Loading...             jillybean86633  over a year ago    that little clicky thing is called an actuator (I think) and I'm having it used on my back right now too, because the chiro doesnt want to adjust my back in the traditional way since I'm using the decompression treatment and my ligaments and such will be much more loose during the therapy.  and yeah, it does hurt a little bit...but when I first started getting traditional adjustments for my disks, those hurt too.  I'm about 3 weeks into it and it no longer hurts to get adjusted.  Perhaps your chiro was using the clicky thing because he did not want to put that much force onto a possibly herniated disk right away.  It's good to get an MRI so you can know exactly whats going on in there.  Unfortunately there really are no quick fixes and you have to do something (like adjustments and physical therapy) for a pretty long time before you can feel totally "normal".  I'm doing physical therapy, chiro adjustments and the decompression therapy 3 times a week for 8 weeks and I've felt relief after week one.  I do NOT want an epidural injection or a spinal fusion.  Those things are BAD news and seem to cause more problems for people than they fix.  I'm glad to hear you're going to therapy!  I actually work at a physical therapy office and the first visit you have usually isn't productive.  You have to work up to the level you would think you would be at when you start therapy.  You might even feel worse after the first few sessions!  While it may seem like you're not doing anything, the therapists know better and I've seen patients over exert themselves many times because they feel like they aren't doing anything and should be doing more.  Now that I've made the longest post ever...lol.  Stick with it! Be patient and you'll feel better before you know it!     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    Hi!!! first of all i have to apologize 'cause my english is not so good, i'm from mexico, i'm 22 years old... i have an extra lumbar vertebra too, i've discovered it when i was 14 because one day without a cause i had a lot of pain in my back, i couldn't walk, to stoop, to remain standing up, the only "confortable" position was in to bed (and believe me, not so much!). i went to the doctor and he told me about my extra vertebra, he injented me an analgesic and he said that i shouldn't be worry about it... two years later i had inconveniences again but i calm my pain with a simple medicine for back-pain named 'robaxisal' (metobarbamol & acetilsalisilic acid)... 1 year later i had pain again and i took another medicine strongest than robaxisal but i do not remember its name. I normally feel pain in my back when I use 'high shoes', when i'm gonna have my menstruation and when i load heavy things, also the doctor told me that i can to pacify the pain with regular exercises of 'column hygiene' like sleeping of side with a pillow between my legs and do some regular activities like sweeping  and things like that in different and better ways.  First of all i thought i was something like a phenomenon but now it is just part of my life, i've never had legs pain or somethig extra than my extra vertebra! =)  but i'm really worried about what willl happens when i get pregnant...  bye!!!

I visited the chiropractor only a few times during a 2 month period. Whatever discomfort I had continued and i realized whatever pain I was feeling could be relieved by a good massage. Today I have no pain issues to complain about. I am sure to stretch and workout regularly to keep strength and flexibility.     Reply                 Loading...

A few days ago (I'm 20 now), I found out I have a 6th vertebrae. The rheumatologist said that that would not be causing my pain at all, but he so no inflammation to indicate RA any longer but my back pain is very severe and radiates up both sides of my back now.     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    I am 33 male and have been off work for 6 months. I have a sacralized sixth vertebrea. I also have a spina bifida occulta at S1 plus a slight reversal of cervical lordosis (normal curve) at C5. I slipped a disc in my lower back and could not even walk. I have broken my hand three or four times and don't go to the doctor. usually handle pain in stride. I have been on pain pills the whole time. tried PT did not help. Went through a discogram where they put a needle into the disc and fill it with dye. worse then breaking bones or anything experienced to this point. The doctor tried for fourty minutes to get the needle into the bad disc. The other discs hurt a little and very uncomfortable but nothing like that one, by the time he was done pushing (very hard) to break the skin of the vertibrea I was just laying there shivering like a child. Nobody can tell me why the disc is so hard. Now they want to fuse the vertebrea. I feel there is more going on, when I first hurt it to look in the mirror you could see my spine curved dramatically now it is not as bad but still hve to sleep on the sofa the bed hurts it. Will be seen by second neurosergeon next month. The muscles in my back are as tight as they could be but after months of PT they are still the same. Just wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone thank you.     Reply                 Loading...

Guest  over a year ago    I found out i had an extra vertebrae when i was 9! after months of me and my mom complaining to the doctor about my back hurting, she then sent me to the hospital for X-rays.  I went to physiotherapy for over five years, and gave up because it hadn't helped the pain at all. My doctor says that she doesnt know what to suggest, and sometimes even accuses me of making up the fact that i'm in pain.  I'm 18 now and i've sort of learnt to live with the pain. My back constantly hurts and pain killers only make a mild difference. I just dont know what to do about it anymore.     Reply                 Loading...             Guest  over a year ago    When I was 29 I threw my back out after a) a snowboarding fall. b) the next day practicing splits during synchro. c) shoveling the wet snow after a huge February storm.  I couldn't walk at all, and my friend drove me to the doctor, I was crawling around my apartment.  The doctor gave me muscle relaxers, which helped, I could walk.  But it didn't really help.  I moved around like an old lady; I could barely stand up from sitting.  I went to the chiropractor, he x-rayed me, and asked how old I was again.  He explained to me that by the time we're 18 or 19 those "extra vertebrae" in the sancral region "fuse" together.  Mine never did, just like everyone else in this post. He explained my lower back will always be unstable due to this added spinal flexibility.  We have extra discs in there, too.  I spent weeks going to him and getting adjusted, and it's mostly worked.  I now do aerial dance, and constantly stretch myself, and my back has started hurting pretty bad again.  I remembered that in my twenties I'd go to yoga, and I never had any problems while I did that.  Tonight I went to a vinyasa flow yoga class, and it has been the first relief in weeks for my back.  I don't know if yoga can help everyone, especially people with herniated discs.  But maybe it might help some other people reading this.  I liken yoga class to giving yourself an internal massage, with the positions they have you stay in  and breathe through.  The stretching of the ligaments in the lower back from yoga seems to help a lot.  But I know I must stay with the yoga routine, or my back will start hurting again.  Good luck.

Lumbarization and Sacralization    Lumbarisation & sacralisation (Bertolotti's Syndrome)     Malformations of the base of the spine and pelvis are very common, with variations too numerous to describe. Being the seat of spinal movement, these structural anomalies subtly influence the free-flowing function of the spine as a whole. The two main congenital disorders go by the name of lumbarisation and sacralisation. In the 'modern' human skeleton the sacrum is a solid bony mass of 5 fused vertebrae at the back of the pelvis on which the upright spine sits. However, in earlier evolutionary forms the segments of the sacrum were not fused. They were free to move - like a tail - and participated as an extension of the spine in normal activity.  what is lumbarisation?    Lumbarization is where the first sacral segment is - at least partially - mobile instead of being part of the fused mass of the sacrum. It constitutes an 'extra' lumbar vertebra, often referred to as L6,    Lumbarization is where the uppermost segment of the sacrum is not fused. Rather it is free to move and participates, along with the neighbouring lumbar vertebrae in spinal activity. The first sacral segment is said to be lumbarised . With lumbarization, anatomists and clinicians have taken to referring to this additional mobile lumbar segment as an 'extra' vertebra, which has led to some confusion in the minds of the patients. There is no extra vertebra jammed into the length of the spine, simply an extra mobile vertebra and one less fixed one. This may be referred to as L6.   BUY NOW  what is sacralisation?  Sacralization is often described as having one fewer vertebra because the bottom lumbar segment (L5) is fused to the pelvis. It can either being fused to the sacrum below, or to the ilium at the side (the large ear-shaped bones of the pelvis) or both. Sacralisation with the sacrum can be termed central sacralisation, whereas to the sides it can be either uni- or bi-lateral transverse sacralisation. Being fused or semi-fused the L5 segment has more in common with its sacral neighbours than its (mobile) lumbar ones, hence it is said to be sacralised .  Central sacralisation may cause hypermobility - even instability - at the L4-S1 level above    With central sacralisation the vertebra may be solidly fused or there may be a slight degree of movement through the presence of a vestigeal L5 disc. It is well possible to get to advanced years being completely unaware that you have one less vertebra. Problems may only come to the fore when fitness levels diminish, particularly the strength of the abdominal muscles.  Bilateral sacralisation usually occurs through enlarged transverse processes either articulating with the pelvis, or fusing to it.     Unilateral partial sacralisation (Bertolotti's Syndrome) causes greater biomechanical disturbance than bilateral    Just to confuse matters, the vertebra in question is often not fused all the way across. It may be fused on one side but not the other. Its participation with spinal movement on one side only makes for very wonky movement and the other working lumbar links above have to cope with that. Where strain sets in there will be pain, often higher up the spine (see below).   what problems do lumbarization and sacralization cause?  It has always been assumed that congenital sacralization and lumbarization are clinically unimportant, but this may not be the case . Generally speaking, both anomalies of the sacrum and base of spine cause trouble, usually because of the incomplete nature of each. With lumbarisation, it is rare for this additional joint to be completely free. With sacralisation it's rare for it to be totally fused. The pure extreme of both is rarely found, rather a No Man’s Land in between.    Read more about this book  Readers' Reviews of Back in Action  BUY Back In Action   Sarah Key's iconic book, in print since 1986, discusses this topic in the section 'Do I Have An Extra Vertebra?'  The same is true of spines that are sacralised at the fifth lumbar segment. Although this segment is said to be mobile, in truth it's not usually free enough . Again this joint is neither fish nor fowl, and struggles to be part of everyday function of the spine. Invariably, this not-quite joint is not up to the task. Furthermore, its debility becomes more obvious with advancing years. Broadly speaking, a partially sacralised joint (with a some degree of movement) is more likely to develop symptoms, whereas a fully sacralised joint (that is fully fused) is usually pain-free but causes symptoms elsewhere at other joints - centrally at the level above and contra-laterally at both the same level and higher levels throughout the lumbar spine. This is described more fully below.  What is Bertolotti's Syndrome (BS) ?  Bertolotti's syndrome is low back pain caused by unilateral partial sacralisation where a pseudarthrosis, or developmental joint,  forms when a transverse process of L5 nudges permanently up against the bone of the pelvis.  The pain of BS is typically one-sided and felt where there is a 'bony hardness' at the top of the back of the pelvis. Unilateral partial sacralisation is the most problematic variant of the sacralisation syndrome as it results in a more complex one-sided disturbance of of the biomechanics through the base of the spine.  Leg length discrepancy may be implicated in bringing symptoms of partial sacralisation to the fore.  Pseudarthrosis (false joint) of small unilateral sacralisation    The pseudarthrosis develops where there is rubbing contact of the transverse process against the pelvis/sacrum. In another example of the miracle of the human body, it is complete with articular cartilage covering the bone and a joint capsule. For the most part, and certainly through youthful years, the pseudarthrosis  spares the body feeling pain, but with age, excessive sitting, high-impact sporting activities,  or a hyperextension injury, the joint  may become painful.  A high percentage if patients with unilateral sacralisatiuon develop degenerative disc disease at L5 and the L4 level above, caused by errant biomechanical forces through the spine at these levels.  Typical bilateral sacralisation pain    Other problems Associated with sacralisation  A fused unilateral sacralisation throws movement strain to the contralateral joint at the same level    Full-fusion unilateral sacralisation of the bottom lumbar segment has several knock-on effects. The first is excessive movement strain of the pseudarthrosis on the contralateral side. One treatment option is to surgically fuse the pseaudarthrosis (see below) although conservative mobilising and self-treatment techniques to make the false joint work better should be tried exhaustively first.  Unilateral fused sacralisation causes contralateral/cephalad movement strain at higher lumbar levels.    Unilateral sacralisation also tends to cause problems in the upper lumbar spine on the contralateral side. Typically, there are problems of the L2-3 spinal segment, usually involving the facet joint as well. The reason for this is not straightforward, although likely to be to do with the normal torque of functional spinal movement combined with the jarring strains on heel strike reverberating left and right through the spine on the way up.  The iliolumbar ligament makes L5 very stable.  By comparison, L4 is flimsy    Full fusion bilateral sacralisation commonly causes degenerative breakdown of the L4 disc above, related to the altered centre of gravity of the base of the spine. With the L5 fused to the sacrum, the seat of spinal movement is raised. L4 - the 'new' spinal base - lacks the secure shoring afforded L5 and this can lead overuse syndrome and developmental instability of the L4 segment. Normally, L5 sitting on the sacrum means the spine originates deep within the pelvis where it is firmly anchored by a three-dimensional array of very strong ligaments. The dense strands of the stellate (star-shaped) ligament fan out either side in robust semi-circles from the fifth lumbar vertebra to various parts of the the inner pelvic bones, lashing the spine securely to the sacral table.  Additional loading from bilateral sacralisation of L5 may cause instability at the L4 level above    For these reasons, treatment for lumbar sacralisation must always involve strengthening exercises of the muscles both front and back of the spine. The spinal intrinsic muscles (multifidus) must be re-educated to bolster the bending strength of L4 as the raised seat of spinal movement and you can see here about spinal strengthening and the Roman Chair . At the same time, stronger abdominal muscles help create a stronger retaining wall at the front. You can read all about the best abs exercises for bad backs here.

The term "congenital scoliosis" refers to a spinal deformity caused by vertebrae that are not properly formed. This occurs very early in development; in the first six weeks of embryonic formation. Congenital scoliosis does not seem to run in families. Genetic studies to date have not yielded much evidence that this condition can be inherited. Although congenital scoliosis is often discovered during the infant or toddler period, in some children it does not diagnosed until their adolescent years.  Pediatric spine surgeons describe congenital spinal anomalies based on which part of the vertebra is malformed or connected. Depending on the structure of the anomaly, the child may exhibit scoliosis (a curve to the right or left), kyphosis (round back), or lordosis (sway back). However, not all congenital anomalies fit neatly into these categories. There are often elements of more than one deformity, particularly scoliosis and kyphosis occurring together (Figure1).  Pediatric spine surgeons may refer to the spine anomaly as a "failure of segmentation." This means that one or more vertebrae are abnormally connected together on one side. This connection will slow growth on that side of the spine. Unopposed growth on one side with slowed growth on the other leads to a spinal deformity. "Failure of formation," the most common type of congenital problem, means that the normal shape of the vertebra is disrupted (Figure 2). "Failure of segmentation" means that the abnormal vertebrae did not separate properly. (Figure 3) On the x-ray these vertebra will look like triangles instead of rectangles. X-rays only show a two-dimensional representation of what is really a three-dimensional problem. The abnormally shaped vertebra may cause a wedge in the front, back, or either side, or a combination, tilting the spine at that level. Pediatric spine surgeons often use descriptive terminology to designate how much growth potential may be in the congenital anomaly. The term "fully segmented" indicates that there is a growth plate and a disk on both the top and bottom of the abnormal vertebra. "Semi-segmented hemi vertebrae" have a disk and growth plate either above or below. "Non-segmented hemi vertebrae" are fused to the vertebra above and below. Since non-segmented hemi vertebrae have no growth plates, the curves they cause are much less likely to progress than those due to semi-segmented hemi vertebrae, which are less likely to progress than a fully segmented hemi vertebra. A "block vertebra" means that there is a missing disk space. Block vertebrae essentially have no growth potential and therefore rarely cause a progressive deformity.  Figure 2: Defects of Formation A: Misshapen vertebra causing scoliosis B: Misshapen vertebra fused to normal vertebra C: Three misshapen vertebrae without scoliosis D: Three fused vertebrae without scoliosis E: Trapezoidal shaped vertebrae with scoliosis (Courtesy John T. Killian, M.D.)    Figure 3: Defects of Segmentation A: Block vertebrae without scoliosis B: Multiple misshapen vertebrae fused on the opposite side with scoliosis C: Misshapen vertebra, unilateral bar, abnormal discs with scoliosis (Courtesy John T. Killian, M.D.)    In the thoracic (chest) part of the spine, congenital anomalies of the ribs often correspond with congenital anomalies of the vertebra. For example, an extra thoracic vertebra might attach to an extra rib. Vertebrae that are connected together may be associated with ribs that are connected together. The anomalies of the ribs and vertebrae are not always identical, but are often similar. A child with congenital spine anomalies often has more than one. This may be a congenital failure of formation on both the right and left sides of the spine or several grouped together or a mix of failure of formation and segmentation.  Figure 4: Three-dimension CT scan of the spine showing a hemi vertebra (partially formed vertebra) at T-12 and between L-2 and L-3 vertebrae  Evaluation  After the history and physical examination, the next step in evaluating congenital scoliosis is obtaining x-rays. X-rays of the neck should be taken to look for abnormal vertebrae in this region. The three-dimensional structure of the congenital anomaly may be best visualized on a CT scan with reconstruction (this study is usually done as part of a preoperative planning) (Figure 4) . An MRI is very valuable to characterize the congenital anomaly and to be certain that there are no associated anomalies of the spinal cord. In children younger than 3 months (before the vertebrae ossify and harden), an ultrasound examination can scan the spinal cord for abnormalities without the need for sedation. The evaluation of the congenital spine will also include an assessment of the kidneys and the heart Because the kidneys and heart are formed at the same time as the vertebrae, children with congenital scoliosis have a 25% chance of having an anomaly in the urologic system (kidneys, bladder) or a 10% chance in the cardiac system. The child's limbs should be examined for any musculoskeletal abnormalities, such as a clubfoot or malformed hand/arm.  Prognosis  When your child's congenital spine anomaly is first diagnosed, no one will know exactly how much the spine deformity will progress as the child grows. There are some clues, however. Anomalies in the thoracic spine tend to worsen with growth of the patient. Multiple fully-segmented hemi vertebrae on the same side of the spine also tend to progress with growth. A hemi vertebra opposite a set of fused vertebrae is the most likely combination to progress as the child grows. Because the most rapid period of spinal growth is in the first 5 years of life, and then at adolescence, these are the two times when the congenital curvature must be monitored most closely.  Observation  Observation is usually the first method of treatment for a young child with a spinal deformity. The physician will first need to determine if the curvature is progressing or worsening. Some children will have a curvature of their spine that is stable and unchanging, whereas other children will have a curve that relentlessly progresses. Just because the pediatric spine surgeon is "observing" your child does not mean that he/she is not treating them. During this period of time, not only will your child's doctor look for changes in the curve, but they will probably order some special tests to evaluate further the child's condition and have you see some other doctors.  Your pediatric spine surgeon will probably want to see your child every four to six months and have new x-rays made. They will then measure the curves and compare them with the previously made films. The doctor will probably continue to observe your child's curves as long as there is no drastic increase in the size of the curve. In some rare cases, the curve improves or even resolves. If your pediatric spine surgeon documents progression of the curve, though, a different form of treatment will need to be instituted. The surgeon will probably want to obtain bending radiographs of the spine to assess flexibility and help determine the next course of treatment.  Bracing  If the curve is progressive, and your child is still growing, the doctor will inform the parent of the lack of evidence that a brace or cast can prevent progression of a congenital scoliosis.  Surgery  An operation is sometimes necessary to address spinal deformity in the young child, and the decision to do these procedures is based on many factors. If the child's curve has shown progression despite bracing or casting, something will need to be done. The dilemma faced by the surgeon is how to stop the progression of a curve without adversely affecting future growth. Sometimes this is unavoidable, as most operations work by stopping abnormal spinal growth in a procedure called spinal fusion.  In Situ Spinal Fusion  Spinal fusion is a procedure performed to stop growth of the spine. It can be done from the back (posterior) or through the chest (anterior) or both. The joints of the spine are removed, and a bone graft is placed; when the bone heals there will be a fusion mass, or one solid piece of bone (Figure 1). The goal is for the many vertebrae of the spine to become one segment and stop growing crooked. In situ fusion means that the curve will be fused "where it is" with little or no correction of the spine. Sometimes instrumentation (rods, hooks, and screws) may be placed to help straighten the spine slightly and act as an internal brace for the bone graft that will form the fusion mass. When implants are not used, usually in young children, the child may need to wear a brace or cast following the operation.  The goal of an in situ spinal fusion is to address the problem early, before it becomes a serious deformity. For example, if a pediatric spine surgeon sees a child with a 40 o curve that has a poor prognosis (high chance to progress); he/she may elect to perform a limited spinal fusion to prevent the curve from getting any bigger. It is generally a safer procedure than those that correct the curvature of the spine. The results of a procedure to correct the curve at a young age can be unpredictable, as continued growth of the spine in other areas can cause the curve to progress or rotate (twist around).  Figure 1A: The exposed congenital scoliosis deformity is prepared for the fusion. Figure 1B: The bone graft has been added to create a fusion of the deformed vertebrae. Postoperatively, the patient will be immobilized in a cast. (John T. Killian, MD)  Hemi-epiphysiodesis  This surgical procedure is aimed at stopping abnormal growth on one side of the spine with the hope that continued growth on the other side will result in correction of the curve over time. Every curve has a concave and convex side. If the growth centers are removed and spinal fusion is performed on the convex side, the concave side might continue to grow, possibly improving the curve. As noted, these procedures can be unpredictable in young children with abnormal vertebrae in their back.  Hemi Vertebra Resection  Some young children with scoliosis may have abnormally shaped vertebrae in their back that causes the curve. Normal vertebrae are shaped like rectangles. A hemi vertebra is shaped like a triangle or trapezoid. When this hemi vertebra is located at the bottom of the spine it can tilt the base of the spine and cause the child lean to one side. In other parts of the spine, depending on the number of hemi vertebrae present, severe deformity can develop. Depending on your child's situation, this hemi vertebra may be removed from the front, back, or both parts of the spine. Once the hemi vertebra is removed the vertebrae above and below it are fused together, often with instrumentation. Most children will wear a brace or cast after the operation until the spine heals. This operation has inherent risks involved; including bleeding and neurologic injury, but good spinal correction is often achieved.  Growing Rods  Most operations that address spinal deformity in the young child work by stopping growth. This may have unfavorable effects on growth of the thorax, lung development, and size of the trunk. The theory of the growing rod operation is to allow for continued controlled growth of the spine. This is done through the back of the spine. In general, the curve is spanned by one or two rods under the skin to avoid damaging the growth tissues of the spine. The rods are then attached to the spine above and below the curve with hooks or screws. The curve can usually be corrected by fifty percent at the time of the first operation. The child then returns every six months to have the rods "lengthened" approximately one centimeter to keep up with the child's growth. This is usually an outpatient procedure performed through a small incision. Most children will have to wear a brace to protect the instrumentation. When the child becomes older and the spine has grown, the doctor will remove the instrumentation and perform a formal spinal fusion operation. In the past, this procedure had a very high complication rate, most of which were related to the instrumentation (hook dislodgement, rod breakage). Newer techniques are more promising but treatment with growing rods remains a long, difficult therapy for the child.  VEPTR Treatment  Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, a newly characterized disease, is defined as the inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth. The thorax, which includes the spine, the rib cage, and the sternum, is the engine of respiration. It must have adequate volume for the underlying lungs to grow and it must be able to change that volume for breathing (respiration) to occur.  Thoracic insufficiency syndrome plays a part in the development of a child in two distinct ways. The first is the inability to support normal respiration. A thorax in early stages of deformity from scoliosis or from fused or absent ribs may have a minor degree of inhibition of respiration and the patient may appear normal. As the deformity worsens, the respiration can become more labored with increase respiratory rate and the inability to keep up with playmates in play activities. When thoracic volume is severely decreased and the diaphragm is the sole source of respiratory effort, then children may need aides such as nasal oxygen, BiPap ( pressure mask delivering oxygen), or even ventilator support to maintain life sustaining oxygen levels in their blood. The second component of thoracic insufficiency syndrome is the inability of the thorax to support lung growth. Early in life, a small thorax may be adequate for an infant, but if the child grows without the thorax enlarging with normal growth sufficiently to accommodate adult size lungs, then by the time the patient becomes a teenager, the thorax that was adequate during early childhood is very inadequate for adult oxygenation needs.  In thoracic insufficiency syndrome, the three-dimensional deformity of the thorax can limit its important role as a respiratory engine. Diseases can affect the spine and rib cage in many different ways, but the common problems are deficiencies in thoracic volume, symmetry, and function.  Most of the work of breathing is accomplished by the work of the diaphragm muscle, which is the thin muscle at the base of the thorax underneath the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thorax increases with the air brought into the lungs. When the diaphragm muscles relax, air is forced out of the lungs. Another important contribution to the act of breathing is the outward expansion of the chest wall itself from the many small muscles between the ribs. For the thorax to have optimal efficiency as a respiratory pump, it must have ideal volume for age, the ribs need to have a symmetrical shape in order for them to move properly, and the diaphragm muscle must be properly anchored at the base of the chest. In congenital scoliosis, there can be missing or fused ribs. When there is an absence of ribs, the underlying lung collapses inward with breathing without effectively expanding. In fused ribs and congenital scoliosis, the concave side of the curve usually contains a lung constricted by the fused ribs. Additional loss of thoracic volume may be seen in scoliosis when the curve rotates the spine into the chest on the convexity of the curve, often protruding deeper into the chest in a deformity called lordosis (sway back), flattening the chest with loss of thoracic volume. In this instance, the ribs cannot move well enough to contribute to respiration, and breathing becomes totally dependent on the diaphragm muscle. Increasing deformity of the thorax results in greater volume loss and may lead to respiratory problems to a point that a child may require oxygen or even ventilator support.  Recently, a new surgical technique termed "expansion thoracoplasties" with the vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR or "titanium rib") device, have been approved by the FDA to treat the combined thoracic deformity (spine/rib cage) by enlarging the constricted chest and straightening the spine indirectly without a spine fusion. Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR) expansion thoracoplasty was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of thoracic insufficiency syndrome in skeletally immature patients. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) is usually associated with uncommon three-dimensional deformities of both the spine and rib cage. Several types of VEPTR based expansion thoracoplasties operations can be used for different types of deformities to gain chest volume for growth of the underlying lungs while indirectly correcting the scoliosis without spine fusion. (Figure 6) VEPTR surgery is extensive, devices are placed under the scapula (shoulder blade) and are attached to the ribs near the neck and continue down to either the spine, or the ribs near the waist, this helps to stabilize the surgically expanded chest wall constriction (expansion thoracoplasty). To accommodate later growth, the devices are expanded twice a year in outpatient surgery through small incisions. Currently, there are a limited number of institutions offering VEPTR surgery. Your child's spine surgeon can advise whether your child's condition is appropriate for VEPTR treatment and provide referral information, if needed. Some centers are using the VEPTR device as a means to straighten the spine indirectly via the ribs and chest wall.

This treatment becomes appropriate when the patient has demonstrated significant evidence of progression of the congenital scoliosis.  Posterior fusion provides permanent stabilization in the corrected position and is achieved by removing the joints between the vertebrae to be fused, usually all the vertebrae which are involved in the curve. Bone graft - either from the pelvis, ribs, or from the bone bank (allograft) - is placed in each joint space which has been removed. Over time (4-6 months), the graft incorporates to the vertebral bone, and the operated portion of the spine heals into a solid block of bone which cannot bend, thus eliminating further progression of the curve. Typically in a child who has reached an appropriate age for definitive fusion, instrumentation will also be placed when the fusion is performed. The instrumentation rigidly fixes the spine internally, so that the corrected position is carefully preserved while the fusion takes place over the 4-6 month period. This rigid fixation is achieved by screws, hooks, and wires ("anchors") attached to the spine, usually at multiple sites along the curve, and then rods are attached to the anchors to stiffen the entire area (Figure 1) . Depending on the flexibility of the curve and any preceding treatment (such as traction), there may be additional correction of the deformity achieved by the application of the instrumentation. However, the primary goal of the surgery is to stop the curve from progressing further, and thus be the definitive stabilization - additional correction is an added benefit but not the primary concern. Often the patient does not need any further external immobilization (cast or brace) if the internal fixation device is felt to be adequate at the time of surgery.
