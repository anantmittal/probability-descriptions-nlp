        The Mathematical Impossibility Of Evolution        PDF     ICR began publishing its popular free newsletter Acts & Facts in June 1972, over 31 years ago. The first two issues were 6-page, single-column, fold-over tract-like papers, black-and-white—not very impressive in appearance.  Issue No. 1 contained only news items describing some of our early campus meetings. Specially featured was the meeting held by Dr. Duane Gish on the Davis campus of the University of California. This was the meeting that involved an unscheduled 2½ hour debate with world-famous evolutionist, G. Ledyard Stebbins. A favorable response from the large student attendance and a very positive write-up in the student paper eventually led to Dr. Gish's famous cartoon booklet, Have You Been Brainwashed? which has been greatly used by the Lord in the past three decades, being distributed in the millions all over the world.  That issue also announced the publication of Dr. Gish's first book, Evolution: The Fossils Say No! which has been used widely and has won many evolutionists to accept the truth of special creation.  Issue No. 2 also was mostly news, but it did contain a semi-technical article on "The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution" which is being reproduced herein as a matter of interest—not only of historical interest as the forerunner of our popular Impact articles (the first of which was published in the first 1973 issue), but also because it still seems to show in a very simple way that evolution is impossible—no one, to my knowledge, has ever tried to refute it.  The third issue of Acts & Facts reported on the first ICR-sponsored expedition to Mount Ararat in search of Noah's Ark, led by John Morris. The first Impact article, however, was published in the January/February 1973 issue on the subject, "Evolution, Creation, and the Public Schools , " urging that concerned citizens should use an educational and persuasion approach, rather than legislation or litigation, in trying to get a balanced approach to origins teaching accepted in the public schools.  In spite of this advice, however, many well-meaning creationists have tried—always unsuccessfully—to try to force this issue. We still recommend education and persuasion as the best policy.  Anyway, an Impact article on significant scientific or apologetics topics has been published every month since that first 1973 Acts & Facts . The forerunner of all these, still quite valid, I believe, is reproduced with a few modifications below:  The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution  According to the most-widely accepted theory of evolution today, the sole mechanism for producing evolution is that of random mutation combined with natural selection. Mutations are random changes in genetic systems. Natural selection is considered by evolutionists to be a sort of sieve, which retains the "good" mutations and allows the others to pass away.  Since random changes in ordered systems almost always will decrease the amount of order in those systems, nearly all mutations are harmful to the organisms which experience them. Nevertheless, the evolutionist insists that each complex organism in the world today has arisen by a long string of gradually accumulated good mutations preserved by natural selection. No one has ever actually observed a genuine mutation occurring in the natural environment which was beneficial (that is, adding useful genetic information to an existing genetic code), and therefore, retained by the selection process. For some reason, however, the idea has a certain persuasive quality about it and seems eminently reasonable to many people—until it is examined quantitatively , that is!  For example, consider a very simple putative organism composed of only 200 integrated and functioning parts, and the problem of deriving that organism by this type of process. The system presumably must have started with only one part and then gradually built itself up over many generations into its 200-part organization. The developing organism, at each successive stage, must itself be integrated and functioning in its environment in order to survive until the next stage. Each successive stage, of course, becomes statistically less likely than the preceding one, since it is far easier for a complex system to break down than to build itself up. A four-component integrated system can more easily "mutate" (that is, somehow suddenly change) into a three-component system (or even a four-component non-functioning system) than into a five-component integrated system. If, at any step in the chain, the system mutates "downward," then it is either destroyed altogether or else moves backward, in an evolutionary sense.  Therefore, the successful production of a 200-component functioning organism requires, at least , 200 successive, successful such "mutations," each of which is highly unlikely. Even evolutionists recognize that true mutations are very rare, and beneficial mutations are extremely rare—not more than one out of a thousand mutations are beneficial, at the very most.  But let us give the evolutionist the benefit of every consideration. Assume that, at each mutational step, there is equally as much chance for it to be good as bad. Thus, the probability for the success of each mutation is assumed to be one out of two, or one-half. Elementary statistical theory shows that the probability of 200 successive mutations being successful is then (½) 200 , or one chance out of 10 60 . The number 10 60 , if written out, would be "one" followed by sixty "zeros." In other words, the chance that a 200-component organism could be formed by mutation and natural selection is less than one chance out of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion! Lest anyone think that a 200-part system is unreasonably complex, it should be noted that even a one-celled plant or animal may have millions of molecular "parts."  The evolutionist might react by saying that even though any one such mutating organism might not be successful, surely some around the world would be, especially in the 10 billion years (or 10 18 seconds) of assumed earth history. Therefore, let us imagine that every one of the earth's 10 14 square feet of surface harbors a billion (i.e., 10 9 ) mutating systems and that each mutation requires one-half second (actually it would take far more time than this). Each system can thus go through its 200 mutations in 100 seconds and then, if it is unsuccessful, start over for a new try. In 10 18 seconds, there can, therefore, be 10 18 /10 2 , or 10 16 , trials by each mutating system. Multiplying all these numbers together, there would be a total possible number of attempts to develop a 200-component system equal to 10 14 (10 9 ) (10 16 ), or 10 39 attempts. Since the probability against the success of any one of them is 10 60 , it is obvious that the probability that just one of these 10 39 attempts might be successful is only one out of 10 60 /10 39 , or 10 21 .  All this means that the chance that any kind of a 200-component integrated functioning organism could be developed by mutation and natural selection just once, anywhere in the world, in all the assumed expanse of geologic time, is less than one chance out of a billion trillion. What possible conclusion, therefore, can we derive from such considerations as this except that evolution by mutation and natural selection is mathematically and logically indefensible!  Discussion   There have been many other ways in which creationist writers have used probability arguments to refute evolutionism, especially the idea of random changes preserved, if beneficial, by natural selection. James Coppedge devoted almost an entire book, Evolution: Possible or Impossible (Zondervan, 1973, 276 pp.), to this type of approach. I have also used other probability-type arguments to the same end (see, e.g., Science and Creation , Master Books, pp. 161-201).  The first such book, so far as I know, to use mathematics and probability in refuting evolution was written by a pastor, W. A. Williams, way back in 1928. Entitled, Evolution Disproved , it made a great impression on me when I first read it about 1943, at a time when I myself was still struggling with evolution.  In fact, evolutionists themselves have attacked traditional Darwinism on the same basis (see the Wistar Institute Symposium, Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution, 1967, 140 pp.). While these scientists did not reject evolution itself, they did insist that the Darwinian randomness postulate would never work.  Furthermore, since the law of increasing entropy, or the second law of thermodynamics, is essentially a statement of probabilities, many writers have also used that law itself to show that evolution on any significant scale is essentially impossible. Evolutionists have usually ignored the arguments or else used vacuous arguments against them ("Anything can happen given enough time"; "The earth is an open system, so the second law doesn't apply"; "Order can arise out of chaos through dissipative structures"; etc.).  In the real world of scientific observation, as opposed to metaphysical speculation, however, no more complex system can ever "evolve" out of a less complex system, so the probability of the naturalistic origin of even the simplest imaginary form of life is zero.  The existence of complexity of any kind is evidence of God and creation. "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth" ( Isaiah 40:26 ).

MORRIS, PH.D.  | SUNDAY, JULY 01, 1979               One of the strongest direct evidences for special creation is the existence of innumerable highly complex systems in the universe, systems composed of components occurring in a pattern of "order" rather than disorder. Creationists maintain that highly ordered systems could not arise by chance, since random processes generate disorder rather than order, simplicity rather than complexity and confusion instead of "information."  For example, consider a series of ten flash cards, numbered from one to ten. If these are thoroughly and randomly mixed, and then laid out successively in a linear array along the table, it would be extremely unlikely that the numbers would fall out in order from one to ten. Actually, there are 3,628,800 different ways in which these numbers could be arranged, so that the "probability" of this particular ordered arrangement is only one in 3,628,800. (This number is "ten factorial," written as 10!, and can be calculated simply by multiplying together all the numbers from one to ten.)  It is obvious that the probability of such a numerically ordered arrangement decreases rapidly as the number of components increases. For any linear system of 100 components in specified order, the probability is one in 100!, or one chance in 10 158 (a number represented by "one followed by 158 zeroes").  A system requiring such a high degree of order could never happen by chance. This follows from the fact that probability theory only applies to systems with a finite possibility of occurring at least once in the universe, and it would be inconceivable that 10 158 different trials could ever be made in our entire space-time universe.  Astro-physicists estimate that there are no more than 10 80 infinitesimal "particles" in the universe, and that the age of the universe in its present form is no greater than 10 18 seconds (30 billion years). Assuming each particle can participate in a thousand billion (10 12 ) different events every second (this is impossibly high, of course), then the greatest number of events that could ever happen (or trials that could ever be made) in all the universe throughout its entire history is only 10 80 x 10 18 x 10 12 , or 10 110 (most authorities would make this figure much lower, about 10 50 ). Any event with a probability of less than one chance in 10 110 , therefore, cannot occur. Its probability becomes zero, at least in our known universe.  Thus, the above-suggested ordered arrangement of 100 components has a zero probability. It could never happen by chance. Since every single living cell is infinitely more complex and ordered than this, it is impossible that even the simplest form of life could ever have originated by chance. Even the simplest replicating protein molecule that could be imagined has been shown by Golay 1 to have a probability of one in 10 450 . Salisbury 2 calculates the probability of a typical DNA chain to be one in 10 600 .  However, when creationists use this evidence from probability while lecturing or debating on the creation/evolution question, evolutionists often dismiss the evidence as irrelevant, using the clever and confusing argument that no arrangement is more or less probable than any other arrangement, and some arrangement must exist! (See Figure. 1)  For example, suppose the ten flash cards showed up as follows:    This arrangement obviously is unordered in comparison with the ordered arrangement below:    Nevertheless, the evolutionist will say, the unordered arrangement has the same probability (one in 3,628,800, or 10!) as the ordered arrangement. Consequently, since some arrangement is necessary, and any arrangement is just as probable as any other, there is no reason to see any particular significance in the arrangement which happens to occur. Consequently, any argument for design based on probability, they say, is meaningless.  Superficially, this claim may seem logical, even though we immediately sense that something is wrong with it. We know intuitively, as well as experimentally, that ordered arrangements are much less probable than unordered arrangements. Random arrangements of boulders on a hillside, for example, are "natural," whereas the same boulders arranged in a circle would require explanation.  Closer consideration, of course, does quickly reveal that such evolutionary reasoning is specious. If arrangement (a) had, for some reason, been specified beforehand, then its actual occurrence in the shuffle would indeed have been surprising. It could then no longer be considered an unordered arrangement, since it had been "ordered" externally! But it was not specified ahead of time—it was just the luck of the draw. Arrangement (b), however, has intrinsic order and its actual occurrence, therefore, would almost certainly not have been by chance.  This type of evolutionary equivocation crops up in various guises. One debater responded to the creationists' probability argument by calling attention to the particular combination of people in the audience. With all the people in the state, he noted, the probability that this specific group, rather than some other group, would come together by chance was "extremely small, yet there they were! The answer, of course, was that the group had not come together by chance at all—each person had come by direct intent. Nor had the individuals in the group been prespecified, as would have been the case in a designed system, where each component had to occupy a specific position in order for the system to function.  Once in a while, the objection is a little more subtle. The fact that a certain ordered structure, functioning in a specific way, seems to have an infinitesimal probability of origin by chance is side-stepped by asserting that if some other chance assemblage had come together, it may have functioned in some other way. Evolution might then have taken a different direction. The present functioning system is merely the natural development from the components that happened to come together, and this is no less probable than any other assemblage that might have evolved differently.  But this tenuous argument implicitly assumes that any chance aggregation of particles will contain some amount of "information" and, therefore, will have some kind of evolutionary potential. Such a belief is gratuitous and naive, to say the least, when all real experience indicates the exact opposite. That is, it is far easier and more common to generate something disordered and useless than something organized and functioning.  One cannot simply pull a working system out of a hat full of random particles. The system must possess the requisite "information" before it can get anywhere or do anything constructive. It must be organized in some kind of pattern, and patterns do not usually appear spontaneously. They are not inevitable, as the above evolutionary argument implies, but extremely rare.  For example, although one could arrange the ten flash cards in a number of possible "ordered" patterns, the number is quite limited. There seems to be a certain amount of "information" in each of the arrangements shown below, but it is obvious that arrangements (b) and (c) are more "ordered," containing more information than any of the others. Arrangement (a), as noted earlier, contains no real order or information—it is strictly "random." No doubt a few other arrangements could be devised with a small amount of order to them, but only a few (See Figure 2).    To be generous, however, let us assume that as many as 100 patterns could be devised for the ten cards which would contain some modicum of order. Each of these would have some amount of "information" and therefore, might theoretically be able to specify some sort of wobbly function. This is entirely speculative, of course, since the only one which is known to be functional is the ideal pattern, as defined in arrangement (b).  Even at best, however, there would be only 100 possible functional arrangements, leaving 3,628,700 completely unordered, and, therefore, non-functional arrangements, a ratio of over 36,000 to one. That is, the odds are at least 36,000 to one against any random assemblage of ten components into a meaningful system, which could possibly serve as a base or pattern for anything.  This simple examination merely confirms that which is intuitively obvious anyhow, namely, that disorder in a system is tremendously more probable than any kind of order in that system -- not only one specific pattern, but any kind of pattern! Furthermore, this improbability increases as the number of components in the system increases (See Figure 3 ).    The number of ordered arrangements shown in the table is somewhat arbitrary, of course, but certainly generous. In any event, it is very clear that the probability of the chance occurrence of any kind of "information" in a system is very small, and that this probability rapidly diminishes as the complexity of the system increases.  This means that, whenever one sees any kind of real ordered complexity in nature, particularly as found in living systems, he can be sure this complexity was designed.  One must conclude that, contrary to the established and current wisdom, a scenario describing the genesis  of life on earth by chance and natural causes which can be accepted on the basis of fact and not faith has not yet been written. 3 I believed we developed this practice (i.e., of postulating prebiological natural selection) to avoid facing the conclusion that the probability of a self-replicating state is zero… When for practical purposes the concept of infinite time and matter has to be invoked, that concept of probability is annulled. 4  There is still one other evolutionary equivocation to be noted, however. What chance cannot accomplish, evolutionists glibly attribute to natural selection.  So natural selection as a process is okay. We are also pretty sure that it goes on in nature although good examples are surprisingly rare. The best evidence comes from the many cases where it can be shown that biological structures have been optimized—that is, structures that represent optimal engineering solutions to the problems that an animal has of feeding or escaping predators or generally functioning in its environment ...The presence of these optimal structures does not, of course, prove that they developed through natural selection, but it does provide strong circumstantial argument. 5  This is a rather typical example of the way evolutionists bypass even the strongest evidences for design. Dr. Raup, with his doctorate from Harvard, is a highly competent geologist, serving as Curator of Geology at Chicago's great Field Museum, and formerly as Professor of Geology at the University of Rochester. He candidly acknowledges the complete absence of transitional forms in the fossil record and the complete absence of evidence for observable progressive evolution.  Instead of finding the gradual unfolding of life, what geologists of Darwin's time, and geologists of the present day actually find is a highly uneven or jerky record; that is, species appear in the sequence very suddenly, show little or no change during their existence in the record, then abruptly go out of the record. And it is not always clear, in fact it's rarely clear, that the descendants were actually better adapted than their predecessors. In other words, biological improvement is hard to find. 6  Thus, in spite of the utter lack of evidence in either living populations or the fossil record that natural selection ever generates higher orders of complexity (or "biological improvement," or "better adaptation") the mere existence of "optimal structures" is taken by evolutionists as confirmation of the remarkable power of natural selection!  But, of course, such a process as natural selection does not even exist at the prebiological level! Whatever effect selection may possibly have had on random processes in later biological reproduction, it is clear beyond any rational argument that chance processes could never have produced even the simplest forms of life in the first place. Without a living God to create life, the laws of probability and complexity prove beyond doubt that life could never come into existence at all.

Home The Probability of Life       Creationists have long asserted that the chances of life forming naturally are so remote that they could not have happened. Read about how, in fact, the chances are much wider than most think.  by Richard Peacock      Creationists often claim that the chances of a modern enzyme forming by random means are astronomically small, and therefore the chances of a complete bacterium (which is composed of hundreds or thousands of such enzymes & proteins) is so near to impossible that it would never happen in the 13 billion years or so since the universe took shape.  The main problem with this argument is that it assumes abiogenesis (the initial formation of life from simpler molecules) was a totally random process. It also assumes that in order for abiogenesis to be successful, a complete microbe would have had to form spontaneously. In fact, the same non-random forces which propel biological evolution also propelled abiogenesis. Specifically, Natural Selection.  The calculation which supports the creationist argument begins with the probability of a 300-molecule-long protein forming by total random chance. This would be approximately 1 chance in 10 390 . This number is astoundingly huge. By comparison, the number of all the atoms in the observable universe is 10 80 . So, if a simple protein has that unlikely chance of forming, what hope does a complete bacterium have?  If this were the theory of abiogeneisis, and if it relied entirely on random chance, then yes, it would be impossible for life to form in this way. However, this is not the case.  Abiogenesis was a long process with many small incremental steps, all governed by the non-random forces of Natural Selection and chemistry. The very first stages of abiogenesis were no more than simple self-replicating molecules, which might hardly have been called alive at all.  For example, the simplest theorized self-replicating peptide is only 32 amino acids long. The probability of it forming randomly, in sequential trials, is approximately 1 in 10 40 , which is much more likely than the 1 in 10 390 claim creationists often cite.  Though, to be fair, 10 40 is still a very large number. It would still take an incredibly large number of sequential trials before the peptide would form. But remember that in the prebiotic oceans of the early Earth, there would be billions of trials taking place simultaneously as the oceans, rich in amino acids, were continuously churned by the tidal forces of the moon and the harsh weather conditions of the Earth.  In fact, if we assume the volume of the oceans were 10 24 liters, and the amino acid concentration was 10 -6 M (which is actually very dilute), then almost 10 31 self-replicating peptides would form in under a year, let alone millions of years. So, even given the difficult chances of 1 in 10 40 , the first stages of abiogenesis could have started very quickly indeed.   Please note: this article uses a hypothetical self-replicating peptide as a model molecule for these calculations.  The current theories of abiogenesis are usually based on the "RNA World" theory, where in fact self-replication was first acheived through RNA molecules, rather than DNA molecules.  See the references below for more information on the RNA World Theory.

Return to main evolution page    David H. Bailey 14 February 2018 (c) 2018  Introduction Both traditional creationists and intelligent design writers have invoked probability arguments in criticisms of biological evolution. They argue that certain features of biology are so fantastically improbable that they could never have been produced by a purely natural, "random" process, even assuming the billions of years of history asserted by geologists and astronomers.  They often equate the hypothesis of evolution to the absurd suggestion that monkeys randomly typing at a typewriter could compose a selection from the works of Shakepeare, or that an explosion in an aerospace equipment yard could produce a working 747 airliner [ Dembski1998 ; Foster1991 ; Hoyle1981 ; Lennox2009 ]. One creationist-intelligent design argument goes like this: the human alpha-globin molecule, a component of hemoglobin that performs a key oxygen transfer function, is a protein chain based on a sequence of 141 amino acids.  There are 20 different amino acids common in living systems, so the number of potential chains of length 141 is 20 141 , which is roughly 10 183 (i.e., a one followed by 183 zeroes).  These writers argue that this figure is so enormous that even after billions of years of random molecular trials, no human alpha-globin protein molecule would ever appear "at random," and thus the hypothesis that human alpha-globin arose by an evolutionary process is decisively refuted  [ Foster1991 , pg. 79-83; Hoyle1981 , pg. 1-20; Lennox2009 , pg. 163-173]. The treacherous world of probability and statistics While not generally appreciated by the public at large, it is a well-known fact in the world of scientific research that arguments based on probability and statistics are fraught with potential fallacies and errors. For these reasons, rigorous courses in probability and statistics are now required of students in virtually all fields of science, and in numerous other disciplines as well.  Attorneys need to be at least moderately well-versed in probability and statistics arguments and how they can go awry in the courtroom arguments [ Saini2009 ]. In the finance world, statistical overfitting and other errors of probability and statistics are now thought to be a leading reason behind the fact that strategies and investment funds which look great on paper often disappoint in real-world usage [ Bailey2014 ]. To illustrate the difficulties with probability arguments, mathematics teachers often ask their class (let's say it has 30 students) if they think it is likely that two or more persons in the class have exactly the same birthday.  Most students say that it is highly unlikely, thinking that the chances that two people have the same particular birthday is 1/365, and so 30 times this amount is only 30/365. But this argument is fallacious, since, for example, in a class of 30 students there are 435 pairs of students.  When the probability calculation is done correctly for the case of 30 students [it is equal to 1 - (364/365 x 363/365 x ... x 336/365)], one obtains 70.6%.  In general, if there are 23 or more students in the class, then the chances that two or more have the same birthday is greater than 50%. For numerous other examples of how seemingly improbable "coincidences" can happen, see [ Hand2014 ]. Fallacies in the creationist probability arguments One major fallacy in the alpha-globin argument mentioned above, common to many others of this genre, is that it ignores the fact that a large class of alpha-globin molecules can perform the essential oxygen transfer function, so that the computation of the probability of a single instance is misleadingly remote.  Indeed, most of the 141 amino acids in alpha-globin can be changed without altering the key oxygen transfer function, as can be seen by noting the great variety in alpha-globin molecules across the animal kingdom (see DNA ).
When one revises the calculation above, based on only 25 locations essential for the oxygen transport function (which is a generous over-estimate), one obtains 10 33 fundamentally different chains, a enormous figure but vastly smaller than 10 183 . A calculation such as this can be refined further, taking into account other features of alpha-globin and its related biochemistry.  Some of these calculations produce probability values even more extreme than the above.  But do any of these calculations really matter? The main problem is that all such calculations, whether done accurately or not, suffer from the fatal fallacy of presuming that a structure such as human alpha-globin arose by a single all-at-once random trial event. But generating a molecule "at random" in a single shot is decidedly not the scientific hypothesis in question -- this is a creationist theory, not a scientific theory.  Instead, available evidence from hundreds of published studies on the topic has demonstrated that alpha-globin arose as the end product of a long sequence of intermediate steps, each of which was biologically useful in an earlier context.  See, for example, the survey article [ Hardison2001 ], which cites 144 papers on the topic of hemoglobin evolution. In short, it does not matter how good or how bad the mathematics used in the analysis is, if the underlying model is a fundamentally invalid description of the phenomenon in question.  Any simplistic probability calculation of evolution that does not take into account the step-by-step process by which the structure came to be is almost certainly fallacious and can easily mislead [ Musgrave1998 ]. What's more, such calculations completely ignore the atomic-level biochemical processes involved, which often exhibit strong affinities for certain types of highly ordered structures.  For example, molecular self-assembly occurs in DNA molecule duplication every time a cell divides.  If we were to compute the chances of the formation of a human DNA molecule during meiosis, using a simple-minded probability calculation similar to that mentioned above, the result would be something on the order of one in 10 1,000,000,000 , which is far, far beyond the possibility of "random" assemblage.  Yet this process occurs millions of times every day in the human body. Is evolution a "random" process? It is also important to keep in mind that the process of natural biological evolution is not really a "random" process.  Evolution certainly has some "random" aspects, notably mutations and genetic events during reproduction.  But the all-important process of natural selection, acting under the pressure of an extremely competitive landscape, often involving thousands of other individuals of the same species and other species as well, together with numerous complicated environmental pressures such as climate change, is anything but random.  This strongly directional nature of natural selection, which is the essence of evolution, by itself invalidates most of these probability calculations. Hemoglobin and chlorophyll With regards to hemoglobin, in particular, it has long been noted that heme, the key oxygen-carrying component of hemoglobin, is remarkably similar to chlorophyll, the molecule behind photosynthesis.  The principal difference is that heme has a central iron atom, whereas chlorophyll has a central magnesium atom; otherwise they are virtually identical.  This similarity can hardly be a coincidence, and in fact researchers concluded long ago that these two biomolecules must have shared a common lineage (meaning, of course, that organisms which incorporate these biomolecules must have shared a common lineage) [ Hendry1980 ].  Here is a diagram of the two molecules [from MasterOrganicChemistry.com ]:   Snowflakes Some of the difficulties with creationist probability arguments can be illustrated by considering snowflakes.  Bentley and Humphrey's book Snow Crystals includes over 2000 high-resolution black-and-white photos of real snowflakes, each with intricate yet highly regular patterns that are almost perfectly six-way symmetric [ Bentley1962 ].  A good online source with numerous high-resolution photographs has been compiled by Kenneth Libbrecht [ Libbrecht2012 ].  Four of Bentley's photos are shown below.  By employing a reckoning based on six-way symmetry, one can calculate the chances that one of these structures can form "at random" as roughly one part in 10 2500 .  This probability figure is even more extreme than some that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature.  So is this proof that each individual snowflake has been designed by a supernatural intelligent entity?  Obviously not. The fallacy here, once again, is presuming an all-at-once random assembly of molecules.  Instead, snowflakes, like biological organisms, are formed as the product of a long series of steps acting under well-known physical laws, and the outcomes of such processes very sensitively depend on the starting conditions and numerous environmental parameters.  It is thus folly to presume that one can correctly reckon the chances of a given outcome by means of superficial probability calculations that ignore the processes by which they formed.        Can English text be generated "at random"? As mentioned above, some critics have equated the notion of natural evolution to the absurd suggestion that some monkeys typing randomly at a keyboard could generate a passage of Shakespeare.  But this too is a fallacious argument. A recent study exhibited results of a computer program simulating natural evolution, which "evolved" segments of English text very much akin to actual passages from Charles Dickens.  In many instances, a class of college students were unable to distinguish the computer-generated text segments from real text segments taken from Dickens' Great Expectations .  See English-text for details. Along this line, computer programs have been written that mimic the process of biological evolution to produce novel solutions to engineering problems, in many cases superior to the best human efforts, in an approach that has been termed "genetic algorithms" or "evolutionary computing."  As a single example, in 2017 Google researchers generated 1000 image recognition algorithms, each of which were trained using state-of-the-art deep neural networks to recognize a selected set of images.  They then used an array of 250 computers, each running two algorithms, to identify an image.  Only the algorithm that scored higher proceeded to the next iteration, where it was changed somewhat, mimicking mutations in natural evolution. Google researchers found that their scheme could achieve accuracies as high as 94.6% [ Gershgorn2017 ]. Closely related are advances in artificial intelligence, in which a set of computer programs "compete" to produce a superior program.  One notable example is the 2016 defeat of the world's top Go player by a computer program named AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, in an event that surprised observers who had not expected this for decades, if ever.  Then in 2017, DeepMind announced even more remarkable results: their researchers had started from scratch, programming a computer with only the rules of Go, together with a "deep learning" algorithm, and then had the program play games against itself.  Within a few days it had advanced to the point that it defeated the earlier champion-beating AlphaGo program 100 games to zero.  After one month, the program's rating was as far above the world champion as the world champion was above a typical amateur [ Greenmeier2017 ]. As an example of the many mathematical studies of evolution, researchers showed mathematically that there was plenty of time in the geologic record for evolution to have produced the complexity in nature [ Wilf2010 ]. Improbable structures and features in nature Numerous examples from the natural world can be cited to demonstrate the futility of trying to argue against evolution using probability -- nature can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features, by the normal process of evolution:  Lenski's 2012 E. coli experiment : In January 2012, a research team led by Richard Lenski at Michigan State University demonstrated that colonies of viruses can evolve a new trait in as little as 15 days.  The researchers studied a virus, known as "lambda," which infects only the bacterium E. coli.  They engineered a strain of E. coli that had almost none of the molecules that this virus normally attaches to, then released them into the virus colony.  In 24 of 96 separate experimental lines, the viruses evolved a strain that enabled them to attach to E. coli, using a new molecule that they had never before been observed to utilize.  All of the successful runs utilized essentially the same set of four distinct mutations.  Justin Meyer, a member of the research team, noted that the chances of all four mutations arising "at random" in a given experimental line (based on a superficial probability argument) are roughly one in 10 27 (one thousand trillion trillion) [ Zimmer2012 ].  Note also that the chances for this to happen in 24 out of 96 experimental lines are roughly one in 10 626 .   Synthesis of RNA nucleotides and other biomolecules :  Many scientists hypothesize that RNA (a molecule similar to DNA) was involved in the origin of life (see Origin ).  But as recently as a few years ago, even producing the four nucleotides (components) of RNA on the primitive Earth was  thought to be a "near miracle."  Nonetheless, in May 2009 a team led by John Sutherland of the University of Manchester discovered a particular combination of chemicals, very likely to have been plentiful on the early Earth, that formed the RNA nucleotide ribocytidine phosphate.  By exposing the mixture to ultraviolet light, a second nucleotide of RNA was formed [ Wade2009 ].  Then in May 2016, one of the remaining two was synthesized, by a team in Munich, Germany [ Service2016 ].  Sutherland's group also recently showed that two simple compounds, which almost certainly were abundant on the early Earth, can launch a cascade of chemical reactions that can produce all three major classes of biomolecules: nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids [ Wade2015a ].  In short, the natural production of biomolecules once thought to be "impossible" is now fairly well understood.   Hawaiian crickets : In the 1990s, a population of crickets in Hawaii (a species introduced to the islands over 100 years ago) became victims of dive-bombing flies that targeted male crickets who were chirping to attract mates, then implanted their larvae in them.  Recently, when researchers visited a region in Kauai that previously was the home to many of these chirping crickets, it was now completely silent, and they feared the crickets were now extinct in the area.  Fortunately, nighttime searches found that in fact there were lots of crickets there, but very few of the males now chirped.  Further study found that in just five years, or roughly 20 generations, a rather improbable mutation had arisen that inhibited the males from chirping, and this genetic trait had now spread to almost the entire population [ Zuk2013 , pg. 81-82].   Tibetan high-altitude genes : In 2010, researchers analyzing DNA found that natives of the Tibetan highlands possess 30 unique genes that permit them to live well at very high altitudes: the genes foster more efficient metabolism, prevent the overproduction of red blood cells, and generate higher levels of substances that transmit oxygen to tissue.  Given that the Tibetans separated from other Han Chinese only about 3,000 years ago, this is thought to be one of the fastest documented cases of evolution in humans [ Wade2010b ].  Many other examples could be listed -- see Novelty and Origin . Dembski's information theory arguments Intelligent design writer William Dembski invokes both probability and information theory (the mathematical theory of information content in data) in his arguments against Darwinism [e.g., Dembski2002 ].  However, mathematicians who have examined Dembski's works have identified major flaws in his reasoning [ Elsberry2011 ].  For a detailed discussion of Dembski's theories, see Information theory . Does creationism provide a reasonable alternative? Does a creationist worldview, in particular the hypothesis of independent creation of each species with no common biological ancestry, provide a reasonable alternative in terms of probability? Here it is instructive to consider transposons or "jumping genes," namely sections of DNA that have been "copied" from one part of an organism's genome and "pasted" seemingly at random in other locations.  The human genome, for example, has over four million individual transposons in over 800 families [ Mills2007 ].  In most cases transposons do no harm, because they "land" in an unused section of DNA, but because they are inherited they serve as excellent markers for genetic studies.  Indeed, transposons have been used to classify a large number of vertebrate species into a family tree, with a result that is virtually identical to what biologists had earlier reckoned based only physical features and biological functions [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92].  As just one example, consider the following table, where columns labeled ABCDE denote five blocks of transposons, and x and o denote that the block is present or absent in the genome [ Rogers2011 , pg. 89]. Transposon blocks
			Species		A	B	C	D	E
        /---------	Human		o	x	x	x	x
       /----------	Bonobo		x	x	x	x	x
      / \---------	Chimp		x	x	x	x	x
     /------------	Gorilla		o	o	x	x	x
-----|------------	Orangutan	o	o	o	x	x
     \------------	Gibbon		o	o	o	o	o It is clear from these data that our closest primate relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos.  As another example, here is a classification of four cetaceans (ocean mammals) based on transposon data  [ Rogers2011 , pg. 27]: Transposon blocks
		Species			A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P
    /------	Bottlenose dolphin	x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
   /\------	Narwhal whale		x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
---|-------	Sperm whale		x  x  x  x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o
   \-------	Humpback whale		x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o Other examples could be listed, encompassing an even broader range of species [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92]. Needless to say, these data, which all but scream "descent from common ancestors," are highly problematic for creationists and others who hold that the individual species were separately created without common biological ancestry.  Transposons typically are several thousand DNA base pair letters long, but, since there are often some disagreements from species to species, let us be very conservative and say only 1000 base pair letters long.  Then for two species to share even one transposon starting at the same spot, presumably only due to random mutations since creation, the probability (according to the creationist hypothesis) is one in 4 1000 or roughly one in 10 600 .  For 16 such common transposons, the chances are one in 4 16000 or roughly one in 10 9600 .  What's more, as mentioned above, an individual species typically has at least several hundred thousand such transposons.  Including even part of these in the reckoning would hugely multiply these odds. But this is not all, because we have not yet considered the fact that in each diagram above, or in other tables of real biological transposon data, there is a clear hierarchical relationship.  This is by no means assured, and in fact is quite improbable -- for almost all tables of "random" data, there is no hierarchical pattern, and no way to the rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern.  For example, in a computer run programmed by the present author, each column of the above cetacean table was pseudorandomly shuffled (thus maintaining the same number of x and o in each column), and the program checked whether the rows of the resulting table could be rearranged to be in a hierarchical order.  There were no successes in 10,000,000 trials.  As a second experiment, a 4 x 16 table of pseudorandom data (with a 50-50 chance of x or o) was generated, and then the program attempted to rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern as before.  There were only three successes in 10,000,000 trials. Like the calculations mentioned earlier, these calculations are simplified and informal; more careful reckonings can be done, and one can vary the underlying assumptions.  But, again, do the fine details of the calculations really matter?  One way or the other, it is clear that the creationist hypothesis of separate creation does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  The only other possibility, from a strict creationist worldview, is to posit that a supreme being separately created species with hundreds of thousands of transposons already in place, essentially just as we see them today.  But this merely replaces a scientific disaster (the utter failure of the creationist model to explain the vast phylogenetic patterns in intron data) with a theological disaster (why did a truth-loving supreme being fill the genomes of the entire biological kingdom with vast amounts of misleading DNA evidence, all pointing unambiguously to an evolutionary descent from common ancestors, if that is not the conclusion we are to draw?).  Indeed, with regards to the discomfort some have about evolution, the creationist alternative of separate creation is arguably far worse, both scientifically and theologically. Conclusions It is undeniably true that there are some perplexing features of evolution from the point of view of probability.  Even at the molecular level, structures are seen that appear to be exceedingly improbable.  What is the origin of these structures?  How did they evolve to the forms we see today?  In spite of many published papers on these topics, researchers in the field would be the first to acknowledge that there is still much that is not yet fully understood. However, arguments based on probability, statistics or information theory that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature do not help unravel these mysteries, because most of these arguments have serious fallacies:  They presume that a given biomolecule came into existence "at random" via an all-at-once chance assemblage of atoms.  But this is not the scientific hypothesis of how they formed; instead, numerous published studies, covering many biomolecules, indicate that these biomolecules were the result of a long series of intermediate steps over the eons, each useful in a previous biological context. Thus such arguments are fundamentally flawed from the beginning.  They apply faulty mathematical reasoning, such as by ignoring the fact that a very wide range of biomolecules could perform a similar function to the given biomolecule.  Thus the odds they provide against the formation of the given biomolecule are greatly exaggerated.  They ignore the fact that biological evolution is fundamentally not a purely "random" process -- mutations may be random, but natural selection is far from random.  They ignore reams of evidence from the natural world that evolution can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features.  Some writers attempt to invoke advanced mathematical concepts (e.g., information theory), but derive highly questionable results and misapply these results in ways that render the conclusions invalid in an evolutionary biology context.  The creationist hypothesis of separate creation for each species does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  It is ironic that to the extent that such probability-based arguments have any validity at all, it is precisely the creationist hypothesis of separate, all-at-once complete formation that is falsified. Perhaps at some time in the distant future, a super-powerful computer will be able simulate with convincing fidelity the multi-billion-year biological history of the earth, in the same way that scientists today attempt to simulate (in a much more modest scope) the earth's weather and climate.  Then, after thousands of such simulations have been performed, with different starting conditions, we might obtain some meaningful statistics on the chances involved in the origin of life, or in the formation of some class of biological structures such as hemoglobin, or in the rise of intelligent creatures such as ourselves. Until that time, probability calculations such as those that appear in creationist-intelligent design literature should be viewed with great skepticism, to say the least. In a larger context, one has to question whether highly technical issues such as calculations of probabilities have any place in a discussion of religion.  Why attempt to "prove" God with probability, particularly when there are very serious questions as to whether such reasoning is valid?  One is reminded of a passage in the New Testament:  "For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?" [1 Cor. 14:8].  It makes far more sense to leave such matters to peer-reviewed scientific research. See DNA , English text , Information theory , Origin and Deceiver for additional related discussion.

Compelling Convergence    June 11, 2011 from News to Know A computer analysis comparing the bone strength of pelicans and whales is said to provide “compelling evidence” for convergent evolution. Because both pelicans and rorqual whales stretch their jaws wide to engulf large amounts of water along with their next meal, both need very strong jaws.

By JOHN ALLEN PAULOS  Sept. 3, 2006   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      A recent international study in the journal Science by Professor Jon Miller of Michigan State University and his associates finds that a growing number of Americans do not believe in the theory of evolution. In fact, the survey of 32 European nations and Japan reveals that only Turkey has a higher percentage of its citizens rejecting Darwin. The author attributes the results in the United States to religious fundamentalism, inadequate science education, and partisan political maneuvering. With regard to the latter Miller notes, "There is no major political party in Europe and Japan that uses opposition to evolution as a part of its political platform." But there's another contributing factor to this opposition to evolution that I'd like to discuss here. It is the concerted attempt by creationists to dress up in the garb of mathematics fundamentalist claims about human origins and to focus criticism on what they take to be the minuscule probability of evolutionary development. (Even the conservative television pundit and ace biologist Ann Coulter has lent her perspicacity to this mathematical endeavor in her recent book.) Creationists argue that the likelihood of, say, a new species of horse developing is absurdly tiny. The same, they say, is true of the development of the eye or the mechanism for blood clotting.  Creationists' Argument  A bit more specifically, the standard argument goes roughly as follows. A very long sequence of individually improbable mutations must occur in order for a species or a biological process to evolve. If we assume these are independent events, then the probability of all of them occurring and occurring in the right order is the product of their respective probabilities, which is always an extremely tiny number. Thus, for example, the probability of getting a 3, 2, 6, 2, and 5 when rolling a single die five times is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 or 1/7,776 -- one chance in 7,776. The much longer sequences of fortuitous events necessary for a new species or a new process to evolve leads to the minuscule numbers that creationists argue prove that evolution is so wildly improbable as to be essentially impossible.   The Flaw  This line of argument, however, is deeply flawed. Leaving aside the issue of independent events, which is too extensive to discuss here, I note that there are always a fantastically huge number of evolutionary paths that might be taken by an organism (or a process) over time. I also note that there is only one that actually will be taken. So if, after the fact, we observe the particular evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole. Misunderstanding this tiny probability, they reject outright the evolutionary process. Here's another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are almost 10 to the 68th power -- a one with 68 zeroes after it -- orderings of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a humongous number, but it's not hard to devise even everyday situations that give rise to much larger numbers. Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule. Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a priori probability is so very tiny. Some ordering had to result from the shuffling, and this one did. Nor, of course, would we be justified in concluding that the whole process of moving from one ordering to another via shuffles is so wildly improbable as to be practically impossible. The actual result of the shufflings will always have a minuscule probability of occurring, but, unless you're a creationist, that doesn't mean the process of obtaining the result is at all dubious.  The Science study is disturbing for many reasons, not the least of which is that there's no telling to what length the creationist trunk of the G.O.P. elephant will evolve.

It is a human tendency to search for meaning, and what could be more meaningful than the belief that our lives have a greater purpose, that all life in fact is guided by a supreme intelligence which manifests itself even at the level of individual molecules?  Proponents of intelligent design believe that the components of life are so complex that they could not possibly have been produced by an evolutionary process. To bolster their argument, they calculate the odds that a specific protein might assemble by chance in the prebiotic environment. The odds against such a chance assembly are so astronomically immense that a protein required for life to begin could not possibly have assembled by chance on the early Earth.  Therefore, the argument goes, life must have been designed. It is not my purpose to argue against this belief, but the intelligent design argument uses a statistical tool of science -- a probability calculation  -- to make a point, so I will use another tool of science, which is to propose an alternative hypothesis and test it.  In living cells, most catalysts are protein enzymes, composed of amino acids, but in the 1980s another kind of catalyst was discovered. These are RNA molecules composed of nucleotides that are now called ribozymes. Because a ribozyme can act both as a catalyst and as a carrier of genetic information in its nucleotide sequence, it has been proposed that life passed through an RNA World phase that did not require DNA and proteins. For the purposes of today’s column I will go through the probability  calculation that a specific ribozyme might assemble by chance. Assume that the ribozyme is 300 nucleotides long, and that at each position there could be any of four nucleotides present. The chances of that ribozyme assembling are then 4^300,  a number so large that it could not possibly happen by chance even once in 13 billion years, the age of the universe.  But life DID begin! Could we be missing something?  The answer, of course, is yes, we are. The calculation assumes that a single specific ribozyme must be synthesized for life to begin, but that’s not how it works. Instead,  let’s make the plausible assumption that an enormous number of random polymers are synthesized, which are then subject to selection and evolution. This is the alternative hypothesis, and we can test it. Now I will recall a classic experiment by David Bartel and Jack Szostak, published in Science in 1993. Their goal was to see if a completely random system of molecules could undergo selection in such a way that defined species of molecules emerged with specific properties. They began by synthesizing many trillions of different RNA molecules about 300 nucleotides long, but the nucleotides were all random nucleotide sequences. Nucleotides, by the way, are monomers of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, just as amino acids are the monomers, or subunits, of proteins, and making random sequences is easy to do with modern methods of molecular biology.  They reasoned that buried in those trillions were a few catalytic RNA molecules called ribozymes that happened to catalyze a ligation reaction, in which one strand of RNA is linked to a second strand. The RNA strands to be ligated were attached to small beads on a column, then were exposed to the trillions of random sequences simply by flushing them through the column. This process could fish out any RNA molecules that happened to have even a weak ability to catalyze the reaction. They then amplified those molecules and put them back in for a second round, repeating the process for 10 rounds. By the way, this is the same basic logic that breeders use when they select for a property such as coat color in dogs. The results were amazing. After only 4 rounds of selection and amplification they began to see an increase in catalytic activity, and after 10 rounds the rate was 7 million times faster than the uncatalyzed rate. It was even possible to watch the RNA evolve. Nucleic acids can be separated and visualized by a technique called gel electrophoresis. The mixture is put in at the top of a gel held between two glass plates and a voltage is applied. Small molecules travel fastest through the gel, and larger molecules move more slowly, so they are separated. In this case, RNA molecules having a specific length produce a visible band in a gel. At the start of the reaction, nothing could be seen, because all the molecules are different. But with each cycle new bands appeared. Some came to dominate the reaction, while others went extinct. Bartel and Szostak’s results have been repeated and extended by other researchers, and they demonstrate a fundamental principle of evolution at the molecular level. At the start of the experiment, every molecule of RNA was different from all the rest because they were assembled by a chance process. There were no species, just a mixture of trillions of different molecules. But then a selective hurdle was imposed, a ligation reaction that allowed only certain molecules to survive and reproduce enzymatically.  In a few generations groups of molecules began to emerge that displayed ever-increasing catalytic function. In other words, species of molecules appeared out of this random mixture in an evolutionary process that closely reflects the natural selection that Darwin outlined for populations of higher animals. These RNA molecules were defined by the sequence of bases in their structures, which caused them to fold into specific conformations that had catalytic properties. The sequences were in essence analogous to genes, because the information they contained was passed between generations during the amplification process. The Bartel and Szostak experiment directly refutes the argument that the odds are stacked against an origin of life by natural processes. The inescapable conclusion is that genetic information can in fact emerge from random mixtures of polymers, as long as the populations contain large numbers of polymeric molecules with variable monomer sequences, and a way to select and amplify a specific property. I will close with a quote from Freeman Dyson, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University who also enjoys thinking about the origin of life: “You  had what I call the garbage bag model. The early cells were just  little bags of some kind of cell membrane, which might have been  oily or it might have been a metal oxide.  And inside you  had a more or less random collection of organic molecules, with the  characteristic that small molecules could diffuse in through the  membrane, but big molecules could not diffuse out. By converting  small molecules into big molecules, you could concentrate the organic  contents on the inside, so the cells would become more concentrated  and the chemistry would gradually become more efficient. So these  things could evolve without any kind of replication.  It's a  simple statistical inheritance.  When a cell became so big that  it got cut in half, or shaken in half, by some rainstorm or environmental  disturbance, it would then produce two cells which would be its daughters,  which would inherit, more or less, but only statistically, the chemical  machinery inside.  Evolution could work under those conditions.”     Stars, Planets, Life    More Articles  What's It Like For a Working Scientist To Write a Novel?

One of the breakout sessions featured a fellow from the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) presenting a lecture about probability and evolution.  His talk was mostly just a watered-down version of William Dembski’s standard talking points.  His triumphant conclusion was that the probability of something or other having evolved by natural processes was one over something enormous, from which he concluded that evolution had been refuted.  There were only about fifteen of us in the room.  During the subsequent question period, one older gentleman said something very close to this: “When scientists are confronted with a probability that small…”  He paused here, as though struggling to accept just how small a number it was.  “What else can they do but just stare at it helplessly?”  I was the next to speak.  I said, “I think I can tell you how they would react to that calculation.  They would question the legitimacy of the assumptions that went into it.”  I then rattled off three implausible assumptions underlying the calculation.  The other fellow just stared at me.  The speaker, incredibly, replied that this was just a popular level presentation, and then rattled off several additional points of disanalogy between his calculation and reality.  He seemed to think that was a good answer.  I replied that the problem wasn’t simply that certain details had been left out of the calculation to keep it manageable.  It was that the variables that were missing could not be quantified with any accuracy.  Consequently, absolutely nothing like what he was doing could be made to work.  He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  Creationists love probability.  If you are a speaker trying to bamboozle a lay audience, there is no better way than to drop in a back-of-the-envelope calculation.  The trouble is that the things they are trying to quantify are inherently unquantifiable.  There is no way to calculate the probability of an eye, for example, evolving over the course of millions of years of evolution by natural selection.  The young-Earthers typically try to circumvent this point by ignoring the role of selection.  They typically toss off combinatorial arguments in which the probability of evolving some complex molecule, like hemoglobin, is taken to be one over the number of ways of arranging the amino acids in that molecule.  Sadly, that only works if all of those arrangements are equiprobable, but the continuing action of natural selection ensures that they are not.  The ID folks try to gum up the works with blather about specificity or universal probability bounds.  But when it comes time to perform specific probability calculations (something they almost never do) they inevitably invoke “irreducible complexity” as an excuse for ignoring the role of natural selection.  That is not a reasonable thing to do, to put it kindly.  I was thinking about this while reading this post over at Uncommon Descent.  Jonathan M. writes:  A couple months ago, I took an online “moodle” class with the Center for Inquiry on the topic of the evolution debate. The instructor was the renowned philosopher and evolutionary biologist, Massimo Pigliucci. I entered into an exchange of dialogue with Pigliucci and the other students on the evidence for the efficacy of naturalistic evolution, as well as presenting some counter-arguments against it and for ID.  During the course of our discussion, Pigliucci made some claims which astonished me — especially as arguments coming from a trained philosopher and world-renowned evolutionary theorist. To my surprise, when I articulated the numerous probabilistic hurdles — hurdles which are so pervasive at every level — which Darwinism has to overcome in order to be considered a viable paradigm, he wrote,  No evolutionary biologist I know…actually attaches probabilities to specific evolutionary events of the type you are talking about. There is no way to do that. Similarly, there is no way to attach probabilities to the set of physical laws regulating our universe, for the simple reason that we have no sample population to draw from (which is why typically you estimate probabilities).   Let’s pause here.  One suspects that the key phrase in Pigliucici’s statement is, “of the sort you are talking about.”  Assuming that Jonathan M.’s vague reference to the probabilistic hurdles facing evolution involves the sorts of things ID folks usually say, then Pigliucci’s statement is exactly right.  When an ID proponent starts applying probability language to questions regarding the fine-tuning of the universe or to specific biological structures, it’s a pretty safe bet they are talking through their hats.  But Jonathan M. demurs.  He continues:  This struck me at the time as a very strange argument to be making given the fact that many Darwinists (Dawkins & Futuyma spring to mind) say that the brilliance of Darwin was to reduce the improbability of getting complex, design-like systems. What was the whole point of “Climbing Mount Improbable”? The point was that probability didn’t have to jump up the sheer face of the cliff. It could meander up the gently sloping rear side, in small probability increments. But if we can’t assign probabilities to the events, exactly what has Darwin’s theory done?  The image of probability jumping up the sheer face of a cliff is amusing, but otherwise I fail to understand how any of this relates to what Pigliucci said.  After all, he certainly did not say that you must never, ever use probability language in the context of evolution.  In context, it is perfectly clear what Dawkins and Futuyma have in mind.  If we naively think of every possible genotype having the same probability as every other possible genotype, and then imagine evolution proceeding by selecting genotypes entirely at random, then the probability is vanishingly small that we shall ever find one that produces a functional, complex organism.  But when we factor natural selection into the process it becomes clear that we should not be treating all possible genotypes as equiprobable.  Instead, most of those genotypes have a probability close to zero of ever occurring, because they will be weeded out by selection.  The handful of functional genotypes will be favored by selection.  In this way it is meaningful to say that natural selection changes the probabilities of evolving various structures.  Notice, though, that neither Dawkins nor Futuyma tried to calculate a precise number representing the probability of evolving some particular complex system.  That’s precisely the sort of calculation Pigliucci was describing as impossible.  Jonathan M. now writes:  In response to Massimo, I cited several attempts by Darwinists — many of which feature in the peer-reviewed literature — which attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of the Darwinian mechanism by virtue of probabilistic arguments. I wrote…  He now unloads a long list of examples in which evolutionists employ probabilistic arguments.  Follow the link to the post for the details. He concludes his list with:  But this should be sufficient to refute your [Pigliucci’s] claim that evolutionary biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility.  He now protests that he never got a reply from Pigliucci.  I’m not surprised, since Jonathan M. is completely confused about what the issue is.  Pigliucci certainly never claimed that biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility (whatever that even means).  He said simply that evolutionary biologists do not assign probabilities to specific events in the way that ID folks would like.  For example, Jonathan M. points to a calculation in which biologist Sean Carroll estimated the probability of obtaining the same mutation four times independently in different orders of birds.  In such a narrowly defined situation the problem has more to do with combinatorics than probability, and we can be confident that all of the relevant variables can be approximated with reasonable accuracy.  He also points to a paper by Durrett and Schmidt , in which they evaluated the probability of obtaining two particular mutations in at least one individual of a population.  Once again, in such a narrowly defined situation it is possible to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  But notice that neither they, nor Carroll, were trying to calculate the probability of evolving a flagellum or anything remotely like that.  In the remaining examples the authors don’t explicitly calculate the probability of anything.  Jonathan M. mentions Dawkins’ “weasel” experiment , presented in his book The Blind Watchmaker. But Dawkins was merely illustrating the power of cumulative selection versus random selection.  He was not calculating probabilities. This paper by Wilf and Ewens , also mentioned in the post, puts some mathematical meat on the bones of Dawkins’ suggestion.  They are working with probabilities only indirectly, and certainly were not trying to assign precise numerical values to specific evolutionary events.  The final reference is to the Avida simulation , but this too had nothing to do with working out the probabilities of specific evolutionary events.  The basic point here is very simple.  A proper probability calculation begins with the definition of a probability space, which means roughly that you must have a grasp on all of the things that might happen and also on the probabilities with which those events occur.  There are many contexts in evolutionary biology where that can be done.  In population genetics, for example, we typically narrow our focus to small numbers of loci over short periods of time, which permits us to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  This is far different from trying to work out precise probabilities for specific structures that evolved over vast stretches of time.  In such situations we have no hope of getting a grip on everything.  But ID folks forge ahead regardless.  More precisely, since they almost never carry out actual calculations, they simply claim that such things can be done and that when they are the result is bad news for evolution.  Pointing out that this sort of thing is not feasible even in principle, as PIgliucci quite sensibly did, hardly implies that probability does not have useful roles to play in evolutionary theory.

I remember being asked to calculate the probability of some existing gene, as if I had a complete evolutionary history by which to crunch the numbers. Geting so sick of seeing the sharpshooter fallacy expressed as ‘proof’ a designer must have done it.          #3  Massimo Pigliucci   August 16, 2011    Yup, you got it exactly right!          #4  wbk   August 16, 2011    If you calculated the probability of the particular arrangement of grains of sand on the beach at a snapshot in time it would be wildly improbable, and yet there it is (and you get a new wildly improbable arrangement after each wave recedes). Mis-interpreting this kind of small probability is very common. We’re encouraged to interpret small probabilities as evidence that an event is unlikely to occur in some contexts, such as the small probability of a chance match in a DNA test in a criminal case. It’s not so straightforward to recognize the difference between how probability is used in a criminal case and how it’s used here. The key, I think, is that small probabilities are really only meaningful when they’re compared with other alternative outcomes (e.g. the probability of a chance match in a criminal case, vs. the probability of a match if the sample came from the accused).          #5  Mike Gage   August 17, 2011    Has anyone else ever tried to comment at Uncommon Descent? I made some very tame comments just pointing out some simple errors in reasoning and they were never posted. Apparently that is their M.O.

Evolution is complex, and there are many factors that are difficult to estimate. However, if one is clever about the way that comparisons are made, many of those factors will cancel out.          #8  Koray   August 17, 2011    No surprise there, Jason. You wrote a book on how people fail to grok probability theory after all.          #9  craig schwartz   August 17, 2011    Given the typical human ejaculate contains some hundred of millions of sperm, and give the number of chance meetings and couplings of JonathanMs’ parents, and grandparents, and along the whole chain of his ancestry, the probability of JonathanM existing at all is vanishingly small. Therefore, he doesn’t (exist).          #10  Bob O'H   August 17, 2011    I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.          #11  Richard Wein   August 17, 2011    To calculate a probability (or any other quantity relating to a real process) we need to be able to abstract the real, complex process down to a relatively simple model which roughly preserves the quantity that we’re interested in. This isn’t always possible.  Nilsson and Pelger did it (arguably) for the evolution of an eye, by abstracting the eye down to its most significant elements, and using a crude general model for estimating the time needed for each small change. (They estimated an expected time rather than a probability, but the two are closely related.) But note that they were showing the existence of an evolutionary scenario that rendered the evolution of that trait probable. It would be much harder to show the non-existence of any such scenario, which is what the creationist is trying to do.          #12  JimR   August 17, 2011    Given that evolution consists of small incremental changes, then trying to apply probability as if each event is independent gives you the (1/quazillion)^wayupthere kind of calculations. This model is completely wrong. Bayes theorem is the only accurate model basis where each step is preconditioned on the prior one. With simultaneous combinations in the 10^? occurring and infeasible ones dropping out, the calculation at each step is 10^?/quazillion), a much lower, but still unknown probability. Also there is not just one selection, but multiple surviving, all of which may be equally feasible. AND most likely there are many replicates of each of the multiple lines. Catastrophic events may weed some of these lines. The many lines and many reps is especially true in the evolutionary changes in unicellular organisms. It becomes somewhat narrower as the complexity of the organism advances. So the timeline for advantageous changes in the unicellular evolution is short compared to the timeline for more complex lines. Yet the time existed. I’m sorry for folks that cannot imagine these vast populations changing over time. There is no end goal except survival at each step. Natural Selection is a scary, but fascinating process. I’m glad I made it to see the advances made up to now. I wonder where life forms will be 10^n years from now.          #13  TomS   August 17, 2011    I like to calculate, using the same methodology, the probability that an intelligent designer would design things the way they are.  An intelligent designer, presumably, can do more things than can be done by “naturalistic processes”.  The probability that something happens is the number of favorable cases divided by the number of possible cases. Intelligent design means that the denominator, the number of possible cases, is greater than the number of possible cases with naturalistic processes.  This means that, no matter how small the probability is that naturalistic processes would result in such-and-such, the probability is smaller that an intelligent designer would do it.  Things would change, to be sure, if someone would specify what sorts of things intelligent designers would not, or could not, do.          #14  Dunc   August 17, 2011    To take a slightly different tack, there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable once you’re dealing with a beaker the size of a planet over timescales of hundreds of millions of years… Sure, the question is fundamentally “not even wrong”, but even granting these absurd premises for the sake of argument, I’m still not convinced.          #15  NJ   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H @ 10:  I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.

They’re careful to list the absurdly large numbers, but never show how those numbers were calculated.          #17  Lenoxus   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H:  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  That’s an… oddly constrained description. Is “the Lord” the name of one of your pets, unable to literally say “that pleases me” but able to wag its tail or rub its face against you?  Or perhaps you are being extremely euphemistic, and “the Lord” is your nickname for a lover? Nothing wrong with that, of course. It’s just that I can’t help but see “if you get my drift” after “he acts in a way I interpret to mean he likes it”.  If “the Lord” is God, I wonder why his tastes have changed. Didn’t the smell of burning ox flesh used to please his nostrils? But now he’s all about the music. An improvent, I suppose.          #18  TomS   August 17, 2011    @craig schwartz #9:  I like that version of the probability argument, too.  The way I prefer to calculate it is:  First of all, excluding intermarriage, a person has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, and 8 grandparents, so let’s assume distinct 10 ancestors per generation in the 19th century and earlier; and three generations per century. That means 30 ancestors per century. If we go back 1000 years, that means about 300 ancestors.  And in those days, a lot of children died before reaching maturity, something like 50%. (We can reduce that number significantly by considering the probability that ancestor X and ancestor Y met and became the parents of your ancestor Z.)  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.          #19  dean   August 17, 2011    “the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) ”  It’s not a think tank: it’s a dogma tank.          #20  eric   August 17, 2011    there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable  Right.  As several posters have pointed out, highly improbable things happen all the time.  In fact, in any circumstance where a large number of different things could happen, there is a near-100% chance that something highly improbable will happen. 🙂  Have a creo tell you what limit makes some event too improbable to happen (i.e., 1 in 10^X).  Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 1.3*X (rounding up), and you’ll create an event that is less probable than their limit.          #21  Raging Bee   August 17, 2011    IF you want to disprove evolution using probability, you have to demonstrate that the creation of all life on Earth as we see it by a “Designer” is MORE probable than the creation of such life through evolution.  So how would we do that?  First, of course, we have to make some assumptions about the Designer: who/what is he/she/it/they?  And since the overwhelming majority of creationists clearly assume it’s the God of the Bible, we’ll go with that assumption: Go — excuse me, The Designer — is a supernatural being of literally infinite power and knowledge.  Next step: what is the range of possible universes this esigner can create?  Answer: an INFINITE range — an all-powerful Go — Designer — can create anything he’s capable of imagining, which, for a being of infinite intelligence, is an infinite range.  So what’s the probability of the Designer creating this particular Universe, with this particular set of life-forms, out of the literally infinite range of possibile universes he could have created?  Why, that would be one in infinity — which is to say zero.  Not “essentially zero,” mind you, not “vanishingly small,” not “close” to zero, but really, truly, exactly, LITERALLY zero point zero zero zip zilch nada buggerall fuggedaboutit.  Creationists, please reply.          #22  Dr. I. Needtob Athe   August 17, 2011    When someone argues that evolution is too improbable to be true, one might respond in this fashion:  “Think about the improbability that you were born. It required that your two parents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did (else your brother or sister would have been born instead), and that, in turn, required that your four grandparents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did so that your parents existed in the first place, which required that your eight great-grandparents all met and mated at the exact time that they did, and so on, all the way back to the beginning of mankind. Therefore, using your logic, I just proved that you don’t exist.”          #23  Vicki   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H: I trust there’s enough fish to keep the Lord happy. (Lenoxus: It’s a literary allusion.)  This is the point at which I want to tell the anti-evolutionists that the probability of humans having evolved is 1, because it has happened in every known universe. I don’t believe this, or rather I don’t think it’s meaningful, but I also think it’s sounder than their numbers, because it’s based on observed facts, namely, we exist.          #24  TomS   August 17, 2011    @Raging Bee #21:  I agree fully with you. I was being a little more conservative, but I agree that the probability that an omnipotent being would create such-and-such is zero .  But I would note that mathematicians do not equate “probability zero” to “impossible”. For example, a real number is rational with probability zero.  BTW, I made a mistake in the final calculations of my post #18. It should read:  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^90 = 1 / 10^90.          #25  Jeff Sherry   August 17, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?          #26  Ken sinisi   August 17, 2011    Doesn’t the seemingly endless debate of evolution vs. creationism, when broken down to it’s simplest form, become a debate of the logical vs. the illogical?

Fodor’s a priori argument against natural selection another. It’s interesting reading about experiment after experiment that illustrates natural selection so well, only to find talking about counterfactuals that rule out ‘selection for’. In defence of philosophers, many rushed to point out precisely where Fodor was mistaken, just as many have argued against Plantinga. But what good does either argument do for the practice of biology? Does either argument make predictions about the phenomena observed? Are they empirically falsifiable? If not, what good are they?          #29  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.

Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #32  Jud   August 17, 2011    One typical creationist error is to consider the actual outcome as the only “right” outcome, and treat one over number-of-possible-outcomes as the relevant probability.  This is what’s behind the argument that the probability you exist is infinitesimal, or the grains-of-sand example in #4.  Sean B. Carroll pointed out in one of his books that if the creationist view were correct, no one would win the (Powerball) lottery for a couple million years – the odds of a particular player winning are about 200 million to 1, and there are two drawings per week, so about 100 per year.  But someone wins the lottery every couple of weeks, so that’s obviously not the correct calculation.  The correct calculation is the one that gives the odds of *anyone* winning the lottery, just as the correct evolutionary calculation is not the odds of one specific mutation, but of *any* mutation occurring that allows the organism to survive and reproduce.  (Those odds are then of course modified by selection in some cases, and go to fixation through genetic drift in other cases.)          #33  Matt G   August 17, 2011    I came up with an analogy.  Imagine playing bridge and having all four players dealt all the cards in a suit.  The probability of being dealt those hands is minuscule, yet the probability of being dealt ANY given set of hands is just as minuscule.          #34  Face   August 18, 2011    denemek lazım kanka denemekden zarar gelmez          #35  Face   August 18, 2011    reis diyosa haklıdır          #36  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, the problem with that analogy is that the creationists will agree that each hand is equally improbable – but that you’ve gotten a royal flush. While any hand is equally improbable, the quality of the hand varies in probability.  That said, they leave the most crucial element out – selection. If you return individual cards and keep good ones, gradually you’ll get a better and better hand. Yes, a royal flush is really improbable, but you’re going to get one so much quicker by gradually mutating a hand than you are doing it from scratch. By assigning those a priori improbabilities, they misrepresent the process, and thus the numbers are useless.          #37  Remo   August 18, 2011    If the universe is infinite (which it may well be) then regardless of its improbability, life will have arisen in an infinite number of locations.  QED          #38  Owlmirror   August 18, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?  Actually, it is almost certainly apocryphal .  But I am sure that Jason knows of the anecdote, and, I hope, finds the reference appropriately amusing.          #39  TomS   August 18, 2011    As far as the “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism”, I like to transpose all of the arguments by the evolution-deniers into arguments where “evolution” is replaced by “reproduction”. It’s fascinating just how many of the arguments for creationism/intelligent design turn out to be at least as good (if not better!) arguments for Scientific Storkism.  For example, let us suppose that our brains are the product of naturalistic processes of reproduction and development. How, then, can we trust out thoughts?  BTW, let us suppose that our thoughts are, rather, just implanted in our brains by some “intelligent designer”. Does that make them any more reliable? After all, this is the same “intelligent designer” who designed the universe with the false appearance of life being related by billions of years of common descent. Would you trust a used-car salesman who told you that the used car only had the appearance of being 20 years old with 500,000 miles on it – it’s “really” last year’s model? (And the used-car salesman is only off by a factor of 10 or 100 – not a factor of a million or so, like “young earth creationism”.)          #40  anthrosciguy   August 18, 2011    One problem pseudoscientists face is that they shortcut from speculation to the end.  While it’s possible that a biologist thinking about evolution (it would have to be sometime back when we didn’t have anywhere near as much info as we do now) might make a probalistic back of the envelope calculation to see if a completely random process — random from start to finish — could account for what we see in nature.  They’d see that it doesn’t, and the reaction would be that they needed to do more thinking about what could account for this.  And they did that and we’ve got a very sound idea of how this happens.  The pseudoscientist typically takes the first speculation and that’s it: they treat it as the finished product and it becomes, in their minds, data.  You see this sort of short circuiting from speculation to “data” over and over in virtually all types of pseudoscience and pseudohistory.          #41  Matt G   August 18, 2011    Kel-  I use that bridge analogy to counter the “evolution is like a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling a 747” argument.  Any number of organisms COULD have evolved, but a tiny subset actually did.  You extension of my analogy is a lot like Dawkin’s “Methinks it is like a weasel” analogy which illustrates how cycles of (random) mutation and (non-random) selection can generate something non-random.          #42  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, indeed. It’s a really good analogy, so much so that creationists still try their damn hardest to miss the point and take the analogy for what it wasn’t. Though it’s even more amazing that creationists so fundamentally misunderstand how evolution works that any talk of probability that they’re going to take any explanation of improbability as being monkeys on typewriters producing Shakespeare.          #43  Pragmatist   August 18, 2011    All of these type of Creationist arguments really are variations on this question: “It works in practice, but can they prove it works in theory?” The absurdity of that is all that is needed to rebut them.          #44  shekhar   August 19, 2011    It is very wonderfull center          #45  John K.   August 19, 2011    Probability is just a way to manage the unknown.  The big problem in  the probability argument here is taking known factors and treating them as if they were unknown.  A set of parents have 3 daughters.  What are the chances the next child they have will be female?  1 in 2 of course.  Why not 1 in 16?  Because the first 3 children have KNOWN genders.  Lottery numbers are difficult to pick because of the many unknown factors.  If the trajectories of all the balls are accurately traced (a difficult task to be sure) the correct numbers could be picked every time.  When something happens that is “highly improbable” to you, it is more a reflection how much of the process was unknown to you.  For creationists that deliberately refuse to consider evidence, it is natural that they think the probability is very low.  Their understanding is abysmally poor.          #46  Lenoxus   August 20, 2011    Regarding the EAN: on top of everything else, it seems that the EAN requires a premise like “It is true that our minds are rational and our thinking process can be trusted to be accurate.” For a premise in a logical argument, sn’t that extremely problematic? How do we know that our minds aren’t faulty?  In fact, it’s worse than that, because we know, from thousands of experiments, the precise ways our minds get fooled; we call them “cognitive biases”. So we actually have positive evidence that if our minds are the product of an omnipotent designer, she wanted them to be irrational.          #47  rob   August 23, 2011    @Remo:  “It is known that there are an infinte number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely products of a deranged imagination.”          #48  Jeff   August 28, 2011    He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  This is what they do. A couple of years ago, I attended a talk given by a YEC who had just bamboozled Harvard into giving him a PhD in Cell Biology. It was sponsored by an evangelical church, but there were a number of scientists and science-oriented people in attendance, including a real microbiologist, and they hammered away at him during the Q&A. Each time he was backed into a corner, made to admit he didn’t understand or was ignorant of the science, he just dropped the issue in question and moved on.  For these people, it has absolutely nothing to do with apprehending objective reality. It’s entirely about getting the ontological security blanket for the few brief decades they’re here – and for many (I contend it’s most), fantasizing about our eternal torment being their half-time entertainment in the afterlife.          #49  Tomato Addict   September 8, 2011    @#7: Michael Behe’s “Complex Specified Information” is a likelihood ratio (sort of), but it fails for the same reason that Jason wrote about. CSI calculates the likelihood of jumping up the cliff, a “big jump” null hypothesis, and claims it is impossible. The possibility of gradual selection, or going up the gradual slope, is not considered, nor it is acknowledged that it isn’t possible to calculate such a number.          #50  Paul   November 2, 2011    Fantastic post I very much enjoyed it, keep up the good work.          #51  Emil Sugak   November 30, 2011    Throughout history man has taken very good records of big events thats a fact. So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded. I mean man has been around thousands of years and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another or one evolving to man. Even if something as far fetched as that happened it would have made headline news, thats also a fact. So if we supposedly evolved from monkeys or apes why then are they still here and why are they not evolving now,Even if they were scientists would be recording it and that would also make headline news, also a fact.So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly,Even you should be able to laugh yourself silly on that one. For everything that happens there is proof,another fact and you know that also. Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true. All that happens all around the world is everything all living things great and small adapt to the environment they are living in. When all evolution theories are proven wrong so far I cannot wait to hear what the next assumption will be, Should be a good one.          #52  Wow   November 30, 2011    > So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded.  It is.  The evolution of viral resistance is a record of evolution, for example.  > and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another  See above.  > or one evolving to man  It isn’t magic. No “Size of an Elephant!” fwoosh.  You’re still beholden to the childish wish fulfilment.  Have a look at the foetus development. There’s a tadpole. There’s a lizard. Then there’s a baby. Then there’s a child. Then there’s an adult.  Those changes are so much part of every day, that transformation from tadpole to human doesn’t make the news because it is so commonplace.  > So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly  You’re proof that devolution happens rapidly.  I guess you just invest whatever nonsense you believe is nonsense and paste it over what you’re told about science so you don’t have to think. How rapid is “rapid” in this case?  > Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true  Bottom line: what is going on, then?          #53  Eric   March 15, 2012    The probability argument is just one. Evolutionists also have to bear the burden of explaining how naturalistic processes somehow broke some very basic laws of nature in order for life to be created, i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics. I find it funny that a group that is so set on evidence being the only criteria for rational belief in something would be quite content with, “We don’t know.”, regarding the theory of evolution.          #54  Wow   March 15, 2012    “i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics”  Nope, biogenesis doesn’t disobey the laws of thermodynamics.  They turn high-energy, low-entropy sunlight at a spectrum of 6000K and turn it into low-energy, high-entropy thermal energy at a spectrum of ~300K.  Nothing broken there.  I find it funny when people find it funny when they promote their ignorance of science onto others and think it proves these others are wrong.       New comments have been disabled.

Question Asked 4 years ago Jeus Jardin  2.55 Universidad de Navarra Is it mathematically possible for evolution to take place given the Earth's age of 4.54 billion years? Is there a mathematical probability explaining the mutation of an amino acid or a single protein polypeptide chain or whatever is the primordial component, to organize itself so as to give the biological and genetic foundation for the diversity of life we have today, given and in consideration of the age of the earth which is about 4.54 billion years old?

Slightly less short: If it wasn't (but see above, it is), a more parsimonious answer than all others would be that the maths was wrong (but it's not). Richard Lenski's work is definitely well worth reading. He and his group have shown lots of evolution within the timescale of a PhD project. Repeatedly. 22 Recommendations 4 years ago J. Patrick Kelley University of Wyoming Remember that evolutionary change is not limited to mutations, but also is influenced by selection and genetic drift. Selective agents (e.g. predation, climate, etc.) can lead to rapid evolution. I know everyone here knows this, but it seems to have been omitted from the question and the answers. Perhaps the original question was meant to ask if modern diversity could have arisen by mutation alone in 4.3-4.4 billion years (based on the recent evidence in Nature Geoscience showing that life could have existed 4.3-4.4 billion years ago). 15 Recommendations All Answers ( 90 ) 4 years ago André F. D'Almeida New University of Lisbon Well, I believe there is no mutation per se in either amino-acids or the protein polypeptide chain, but in the codons (and probably duons) that carry the code for creating them (mRNA). I would however point out to this paper where they provide a very good argument for the question you are posing. Albeit not being an expert in the matter, I do agree with their conclusions. http://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22454.short Alternatively, you can look at papers on mathematical models for complex systems and self-organization. Have a look here for an introduction: http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/SELFORG.html 4 years ago Deleted profile Added an answer Dear Jeus Jardin, One thing old Pascal was very clear on was to avoid the phrase 'probability'. He consistently used 'chance' or something equivalent in french. In genetics this seems important, you do not have a 1 in [some big number] probability something will happen. Things happen by chance and only afterward we can re-analyse the whole process more-or-less and come up with this 1 in [big number]. If you were very mechanically inclined you could look at DNA, look at what processes can change it, look at how such a change might be viable, ... Would the outcome, a very tiny number, be of any importance ? I am afraid that your question cannot be answered in the sense you use (has there been time enough ?). We have only one example of a primordial mess eventually producing us in some four billion years. I would hesitate to put a number on that chance. Met hartelijke groeten,   Henk Smid 3 Recommendations 4 years ago J. Patrick Kelley University of Wyoming Remember that evolutionary change is not limited to mutations, but also is influenced by selection and genetic drift. Selective agents (e.g. predation, climate, etc.) can lead to rapid evolution. I know everyone here knows this, but it seems to have been omitted from the question and the answers.

Papageorgiou Democritus University of Thrace Since mutation is the only primary source of diversity - which then is influenced by selection, migration, drift, mating - you probably ask if 5.54 billion years are enough for mutations to produce all the existing alleles of all genes plus the ones that are lost on the way. With a roughly estimated mutation rate of 1/10^-4 to 1/10^-6 per gene per generation and the fact that each individual of each species has thousands of genes, then I suppose that time was more than enough to produce the basis of allelic richness that exists today in nature. Also think that life on earth is much younger than the geological life of our planet, probably the half. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Johannes Enroth University of Helsinki I wish to ignore all creationist crap here. Mathematical probability is completely irrelevant, as the outcome is what it is, what we are. We know a lot about molecules but we cannot know the exact circumstances in which the first chemical and then biological evolution took place. I think in lottery (here in Finland) the probability that the "right" combination of seven numbers comes out is about one in 15 million, and yet every week some combination does come out, although it had exactly the same probability as any other combination of seven numbers. It is absurd to ask "how probable is it that we are here?" 5 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter Keller I do think it is an important and relevant question, even if the answer can only be philosphical until we discover life somewhere else. Until then, it is a "sample size of one" problem with all statistical implications. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Mark van Hoeij Florida State University Nobody knows if the chance of life getting started on a favorable planet is tiny or high. That is one of the main reasons why people want to build very large telescopes to view extra-solar planets (it would be interesting to know if one can find extra-solar planets with oxygen, because O2 is an indicator of life). As for what happened after life got started, there is lots of data about that here on Earth, so detailed answers are possible. The probabilities, expected amount of time for changes to occur, etc, these are known, tested, compared in multiple ways (e.g. fossils vs DNA), etc. I attended a creationist talk, and the most convincing argument he made was that favorable mutations are unlikely to accumulate "quickly" (even on geologic time scales). After analyzing the argument, I realized that it only applies to asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is a method in which favorable mutations can accumulate fairly quickly (on geologic time scales). The end result of the argument is that we should expect evolution to be slow in asexual reproduction, but much faster in sexual reproduction  (note: you might think that bacteria should then evolve very slowly because they reproduce asexually, but this is not quite the case because bacteria do in fact exchange genetic information, and at the end of the day, all that the creationist argument really proved is that evolution will be slow if there is really no exchange of genetic information taking place, but that's not how biology operates in the real world). Species are not cleanly separated. A big chunk of your DNA comes from virusses having inserted their genetic information into one of your ancestors. Comparing your DNA with other species, particularly the parts of your DNA with clear viral origin, gives extremely strong evidence of common origins. If you want to calculate probabilities, consider this:   If chimpanzees and humans do not share common ancestors, then what is the probability that these two species have hundreds of positions in their DNA where viral DNA was inserted at exactly the same position? (the type of virus matches each time as well) 5 Recommendations 4 years ago Kurt Bernardo Wolf Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México I think it is a relevant question that might be answered to some debree by biophisicists who have determined mean mutation rates in DNA, be it out of theoretical considerations or experimental (i.e. archaeological) statistics. The assumptions that the process be linear, punctuated or episodic are of course relevant. Good topic for a PhD thesis. The religious viewpoint is beside the point. 4 years ago Peter D Roopnarine California Academy of Sciences You know, scientists actually do work on this problem. It is not a philosophical question, since life obviously has originated at least once, and the best of our evidence suggests that life did indeed originate here on Earth. The question of whether there is work toward the questions of probability and elapsed time can be answered as "Yes". Some accessible work on this topic, though not the most current, would be Eigen and Schuster's "Hypercycle" and Stuart Kauffman's "Investigations". No comment on the creationist nonsense. Oh, and someone above mentioned Maynard Smith: Maynard Smith and Szathmary's "Major Transitions in Evolution" is also very accessible. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago Mike S Fowler Swansea University Short answer: yes. Slightly less short: If it wasn't (but see above, it is), a more parsimonious answer than all others would be that the maths was wrong (but it's not). Richard Lenski's work is definitely well worth reading. He and his group have shown lots of evolution within the timescale of a PhD project. Repeatedly. 22 Recommendations 4 years ago James D Westmancoat Queen Mary, University of London Yes - Estimates of evolutionary change are based on a conservative rate of mutational occurrence. It is not therefore out of reasonable speculation to have achieved this within 4.54 billion years. It is however impossible to have achieved this within 6000 years. So for those trying to use this to put creationism into science just remember that Charles Darwin, the devout Christian that he was, himself tried, failed and concluded that evolution was the only way for this level of diversity to have arisen. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester As #Peter Keller  said, we have a sample size of 1. But we also have a probability of 1. I think, therefore I am. And if we are, then it did happen. Apologies for the obvious circular reasoning, but it is kind of inescapable, as we are here and we did evolve within that time scale. Or is anyone seriously considering the idea that we were seeded by astronauts? 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter Keller The problem is, we are part of the sample size of one. That life came into existence on earth is clear and has probability one (because we are living proof that it happened), indeed. But it is a conditional probability. There is no hope to calculate the probability of life in general, as long as we don't find other "samples", as we, in some sense, don't have access to the whole sample space. We can only speculate how it happened and there are good people out there who try exactly that. Luckily however, there is not the slightest indication that we were created by a divinity or star travelling species, neither is there any necessity for it. 4 years ago Kurt Bernardo Wolf Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México It would be useful if the authors or citators of articles on evolution rate would give the exact bibliographical reference, so we can decide on the question on the basis of their analyses.  Philosophy doesn't help to resolve the question: can the diversity of life at present be explained by random mutations + survival rate + global extinction events + everything else?  Is it the invisible hand of God or is it that of the free market? 4 years ago Marco Marzola New University of Lisbon The only true answer is: 'Yes, it is. On this planet, under the conditons that ruled on this planet since its formation, 4.54 billion years are mathematically sufficient'. If then you ask why, well... there is no other answer than life on this planet is the only evidence of that time gap to be enough. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Jean-Sébastien Pierre Université de Rennes 1 Actual science proves it did. As soon as you have true cells, even procaryotic, with nucleic acid and protein synthesis machinery, the time elapsed is fully compatible with complex evolution. The question of prebiotic evolution is much more tricky as we know very few about it. Even LUCA can only be reconstructed under the hypothesis that it is an organism based on a nucleic acid, likely a RNA but what about before ? 4 years ago Mark McMenamin Mount Holyoke College Your question seems to assume steady, gradual microevolutionary change over billions of years. The paleontological evidence indicates that the evolutionary process is episodic in the extreme. We do not yet have a reasonable explanation of the mechanisms that drive macroevolutionary change, most of which seems to have been very rapid (see my review "Breakthrough on the Cambrian Explosion"). So, the question of whether 4.5 billion years is enough time to account for observed evolutionary divergence is beside the point, because evolution does not seem to have occurred in a gradual-Neodarwinian fashion. Poorly understood and apparently fast evolutionary transitions have occurred between the major groups. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago William Mayor In attempting to answer a question like this, one should consider their assumptions.  For a die hard new earth creationist there is clearly not enough time.  For someone committed to only evolution being the factor, there clearly had to be enough time.  If one falls somewhere in between these positions, possibly some variation of directed evolution, the question might be answered either way.  I will stand with there being enough time though, thus ruling myself as not being a die hard young earth creationist, but not revealing much beyond that. 4 years ago Deleted profile Added an answer Yes of course it is mathematically possible that evolution happened over that time period. Our best explanation for the past few billion years of life shows that. Is it possible mathematically to recreate the evolutionary events exactly? No, This is simply impossible epistemologically. But we can get good estimate that are probably close to the real - but ultimately unknowable - history. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Milton De Souza Mendonça Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Adding to Mark Mcmenamin's answer, there is much beyond macroevolution and we are still figuring that out as he stated. I would add that apart from outside selective pressures due to negative interactions (predation, parasitism), positive interactions have been paramount to evolutionary changes. All the major transitions in evolution (as per Maynard-Smith) involve organisms "learning" to collaborate to become more efficient - eucaryotic organisms, multicellular organisms, social organisms. This leads to highly non-linear paths for evolution to follow, and steps appear where before the road appeared to be even. Another important phenomenon is niche construction, in which the change exerted by some organisms on the outside environment becomes an extended phenotype. The effects of this extension are not only crucial for the present generation but can be inherited by the following ones, leading again to non-linear interactions between environmental selective pressures and evolutionary responses of the organisms in question. As suggested above by other contributors, the mathematics is much more complicated than simply adding adaptive mutations and subtracting the bad ones... in soma, it could have taken less than 4 billion years for evolution to come to where it is, it could have taken more - it's not simple ballistics. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Peter J Richerson University of California, Davis I think the single most convincing bit of data comes from Philip Gingerich's 1983 classic on rates of evolution, published in Science. Gingerich plotted rates of evolution as estimated from data collected over different time intervals. He plotted lab data using microbial populations, field studies of usually one to a few years, and on out to paleontological time scales. Rates collected at short time scales are ever so much faster than those estimated from the fossil record. The simplest interpretation of this pattern is that selection in the short run is responding to all sorts of noisy environmental variation. The long term net changes in the environment are generally slower, so long term evolution averages out a lot of short term variation. Thus, evolution seems to have ample "reserve capacity." If there had been sustained rapid, directional environmental change, evolution would probably have kept up. Of course in the rare major extinction events, most lineages do fail to keep up with very rapid or very extreme environmental change. But it seems to take only a few million years for diversity to recover after mass extinctions, also suggesting that evolution is a pretty rapid process. The Cambrian explosion that gave us the first diverse fauna of large animals with skeletons was pretty rapid too. It probably represents the first time large volumes of seawater carried enough oxygen to support the high energy physiology necessary for large animals. John Thompson had a book out last year with Chicago entitled Relentless Evolution. He reviews a large number of field and lab studies illustrating the rapidity of everyday evolution in response to selection pressures varying in time and space. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Erik I Svensson Lund University The question is wrongly formulated, as evolution is certainly not driven only by mutations, but also and largely be selection and to a minor extent by genetic drift. The rate of evolution is, in the univariate case and for a single continuous trait: R = h2*S Where R = is per-generation phenotypic response, h2 is narrow-sense heritability and S is the selection differential. This is the so-called "Breeders equation of quantitative genetics". Most morphological traits have heritabilities well above zero, usually around 0.4 on average. It does not require much selection with this high level of heritability and not many generations to turn a mouse in to an elephant, provided that selection is chronic and persistent. Thus, your question should be reformulated: "GIVEN high amount of genetic variation and high heritabilties and strong selection, why has not more evolutionary change happened during 4.5 billion years, and why is stasis more common than change?". The main problem for evolutionary theory is therefore to explain why organisms do not change more often and so slowly, rather than to ask if time is sufficient. It is clearly sufficient, it is MORE than sufficient. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Arieh Ben-Naim Hebrew University of Jerusalem Yes, definitely yes. The proof is the fact that we are here. If it were not possible, no one will be here to ask the question, and , of course, to answer the question Arieh 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Deleted profile Added an answer Genetic drift is not minor in small or isolated populations and can and has had a very great affect on billions of years of evolution. The extent to which mutation drift and selection each have on evolutionary history depends on effective population size, genetic diversity and a host of variables that are analyzed with population genetic techniques that are not as simple as the single equation listed. And it is not true that slow change is a "problem for evolutionary theory". Rapid evolution occurs when changes in environment (say) drive strong selection. But very much selection is stabilizing and slow. Lineages are not compelled to evolve for changes sake. They change in response to drift and selective pressures of a changing environment. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester Asa #Arieh Ben-Naim  well said.

To quote from the introduction to HO, S. Y. W., LANFEAR, R., BROMHAM, L., PHILLIPS, M. J., SOUBRIER, J., RODRIGO, A. G. and COOPER, A. (2011), Time-dependent rates of molecular evolution. Molecular Ecology, 20: 3087–3101. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05178.x: "More than half a century ago, Kurtén (1959) found an inverse correlation between the rate of morphological evolution and the time interval over which the rate was measured.  Specifically, the rate of morphological change between successive generations exceeded macroevolutionary rates by several orders of magnitude.  This time-dependent rate pattern was confirmed in a number of subsequent studies, which consistently showed that morphological evolutionary rates appeared faster when measured over shorter timescales (Gingerich 1983, 2001; Roopnarine 2003).  A similar phenomenon has recently emerged in rates of molecular evolution estimated from DNA sequence data.  In particular, there is a striking disparity between spontaneous mutation rates, measured over a small number of generations in studies of pedigrees and laboratory mutation-accumulation lines, and the much lower substitution rates measured over geological time frames (e.g., Parsons et al. 1997; Howell et al. 2003; Santos et al. 2005; Gibbs et al. 2009)."  The authors go on to propose several explanations for the incongruous rapidity of observed short-term mutation rates.

Davis University of Cambridge Yes! 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Ed Landing New York State Museum Ernst Mary probably had one of the best definitions of "evolution"--as the change in gene frequencies in populations of organisms. So, the annual change in flu strains demonstrates evolution as antibody-driven selection on the viruses leads to a change in virus genome, while heavy commercial fishing quickly drives fish to reproduce earlier in life and at smaller growth stages. There likely is no simple mathematical answer to your question as factors well above the level of mutations (of genes, not their product amino acids), such as community evolution are likely the strong selective agents that "drive" episodes of evolutionary radiation. Just as the concepts of a very old Earth and Darwinian evolution accorded with the successive  appearances and extinctions of  magor groups of organisms by the mid-1800s, modern, precise dating techniques (as U-Pb of zircons) help determine rates of major evolutionary replacements. So, I think it can be said that the fossil record and precise age dates show the unlikelihood of useful molecular clocks, but rather great changes in rates of evolution followed by lengthy relative stasis--a really difficult history to model mathematically. 4 Recommendations 4 years ago Hemanta K.

If you mean here on Earth, evolution never stopped, and never will stop as long as life persists.  If you mean elsewhere in the universe, there are, I'm afraid, insufficient data for a meaningful answer.  At least right now -- this is one reason why scientists continue to look within and without.  Within, they try to learn how life originated here, and the conditions under which it happened.  As reasonable ideas for this develop, it may become possible use new observations of distant stars and planets to estimate how often, among Carl Sagan's "billions and billions of stars in billions and billions of galaxies", these conditions may have arisen. 4 Recommendations 4 years ago Hemanta K.

When you consider the exponential nature of evolution across lineages and their interactions, then evolution as we understand it is plausible.  However, the evolution of modern cells (modern as in ~2 bya) is wide open.  Consider further that the traces of life are present in rocks ~4 bya.  We have not got to the bottom of the matter yet, leaving open the possibility of panspermia. That of course opens another can of worms...  Given we know exceedingly little about the conditions under which "life" initiated, it is going to take a lot of work to unravel the mystery of mysteries. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago William Mayor I will begin by stating that I have not looked into this for several years, so things might have changed, but when I last looked into the question of the "Last Universal Common Ancestor" (LUCA) the consensus was that it never existed.

Did evolution come only for a small time interval and then ... the door simply closed? 4 years ago Andrew Derksen Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Wait, what? What do you mean, "stopped evolving"? All of us ["current primates"] continue to experience selective forces and produce offspring with variable hereditary characters resulting in relatively different reproductive success. Evolution is a continuous process. There are probably a number of "incipient" species developing as we speak - but because we are in the middle of the process, it is difficult to see where it will wind up. Examples of potential allopatric speciation: 1.) How many generations before macaques or chimps imported to the United States as research primates and left to retire on open farms in Texas or Florida become zygotically isolated without regular drift from other populations? 2.) What about habitat fragmentation in Africa, Asia, and South America, as development pushes or eliminates bridges between populations? Potential sympatric speciation: 1.) Perhaps human-mediated extinction has eliminated a major competitor or predator from a particular environment; surviving primates now compete to fill that particular niche, or continue to diversify and exploit specialized niches within their own environments. Ongoing major selective forces: 1.) Human development changes habitat drastically, and survivors must adapt or go extinct. 2.) Global warming expands old ranges and changes ecosystems drastically; survivors must adapt or go extinct. 6 Recommendations 4 years ago Demetris Christopoulos National and Kapodistrian University of Athens I see ... probably it is not possible to do a plain conversation without being stoned (two downvotes for a simple question...?)

Your assertion is absolutely false. All the species that exist (or have existed) on this planet continue to evolve ALL THE TIME!  Like Andrew said above, it is a continuous process. Hence present day humans are evolving, just like the present day chimps are. I think your question got down-voted because it is based on a false assertion which betrays a total ignorance about the meaning and mechanisms of evolution! I will try to to compile specific examples of recent human evolution if you are truly interested. Best, ~a. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Demetris Christopoulos National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Dear Amit, I meant the evolution of monkeys to human beings, that's all. Have you any evidence about such a process? 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester Dear Demetris Christopoulos Monkeys did not evolve into human beings. Monkeys and humans had a common ancestor. 4 Recommendations 4 years ago Andrew Derksen Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Mr. Christopoulos, I see from your profile that you are an economist, and perhaps this explains your lack of awareness of certain defining elements of biology. Evolution is a blind and directionless process whose "victories" are only described in terms of a lineage's ability to keep its descendents playing in the game.  It is not a "ladder", with one form of life gradually developing into another in a procedural fashion, and any one being more "advanced" than another. There never was a rank following from bacterium --> protozoan --> sponge --> fish --> reptile --> mammal --> primate --> humanity. All of those organisms are different attempts by competing but distantly related strains of DNA to continue reproducing themselves in the environment. They are all the sophisticated end-products of billions of years of evolutionary history.  All of them continue to evolve as populations! To draw an analogy from a human family tree: you are the most recent end-product of your family's evolutionary history, but this does not deny the possibility that you might also have cousins. Humanity shares a common ancestor with monkeys - just as you and your hypothetical cousin share a common ancestor in your grandparents. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago William Mayor Evolution is a process by which one species or another gradually adapts to better survive in a given ecological niche.  There is some evidence of possible human evolution going on in the gradual increase in the number of people who have the super good form of cholesterol.  All people who have this specific form are descendants of one specific couple, and the normal arterial plaque simply does not develop in their arteries no matter what high cholesterol foods they eat.  These people have a definite survival advantage over the rest of us, and I imagine that eventually this gene will be present in most if not all humans.  However, it will also take a long time to reach that point. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Amit Sinha New England Biolabs Hi Demetris, No I do not have any evidence of any process in which monkeys evolved into humans, because this actually never happened, that is not how evolution works! What I do have evidence for and what actually did happen was this : There was a common ancestor to both humans and monkeys but which itself was neither a monkey nor a human, whose offsprings gave rise to independent lineages / populations, which continued to evolve over many subsequent generations to give rise to the present day monkeys and humans etc. (This is again what Fernando and Andrew have already explained above). Your statement about "evolution of monkeys to human beings" again stems from you having a very wrong concept of evolution! The whole idea of there being a straight line of descent from monkeys to humans is wrong, but unfortunately this is a very common mis-conception that many people continue to have. I think one of the reasons for this is widespread use of cartoons or caricatures in which one starts with a monkey on the left and ends up with a human on the right, but that is just a cartoon and very wrong! So I will just leave you with two images which explain the errors in your understanding of evolution (and perhaps the source of these errors). The key concepts that you need to distinguish between are  "linear descent" versus a "tree of life": Image 1 source : https://matthewbonnan.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/apparently-ive-gone-viral-or-stick-figures-and-evolution/ this_is_evo lution.jpg 198.80 KB 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Amit Sinha New England Biolabs and Image 2 source: http://alwaysquestionauthority.com/2013/06/10/evolution-this-is-not-evolution-this-is-evolution-richard-dawkins/ this_is_evol ution2.jpg 432.60 KB 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter J Richerson University of California, Davis Demetris, There is lots of neat work on human genetic responses to selection in the present and recent past.

Glosochronometric research [excuse my scientiese -estimating the lenght of time since two languajes diverged, i.e. French and Spanish from Latin since the low middle ages]. This cannot be measured in DNA differences, but with computers that understand words and grammar, our philologist colleagues have done a good job. It strikes me that punctuated events also exist with languages, in the form of lost/gained battles between peoples, the dominance of one and the extinction of the other carries over to their languages. Defeat of the other side in Roncesvalles would made Spanish and French dialects of Arabic. The vagaries of history and the branching/mixing of our ~6000  tongues has been stopped recently, with the imposition of a central dialect for families such as Spanish (Mexican accent), French (Parisian), Italian (Tuscan), English (-a problem here), etc., due to the ubiquity of radio and tv programs in those central dialects. Perhaps species and linguistic evolution depart into two dynamics, with the latter becoming frozen in time, with only a couple of hundred being used as "national" languages, Further differences to ponder:  What is the meaning of a lingua franca, such as Swahili or Bahasa Indonesia, or the various pidgins and creolles? (interspecies breeding?)  What about Hebrew, or classical Greek vs. Demoticos? (resurrection of one, cheap magic of the other?). It is probably true that the rules of linguistic change have changed from species evolution to a new set of rules due to government, massive comunication and globalization. (Are we not depleting the natural biodiversity to just a few useful species?) 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter J Richerson University of California, Davis Actually, surprisingly perhaps, languages continue to evolve. Many small languages are going extinct while dialects of big languages continue to change. A rough generalization is that wherever social fault lines arise, language differences tend to emerge. William Labov, the pioneer student of the microevolution of dialect, produced two big treatises.  I don't know of any good reasonably accessible intros to his sociolinguistics work. The most interesting part of the story is that language evolution is led by pre-pubescent girls. Women are more verbal than men and tend to speak more "advanced" versions of local dialects. The ability to master a new dialect shuts down in most people in adolescence. The top-down attempts to control language evolution via official dialects, school instruction, standard broadcast dialects and the like seem to have little effect. Labov, W. (1994).

Malden, MA: Blackwell. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Demetris Christopoulos National and Kapodistrian University of Athens We say the same thing, although you are more specialist in terminology: If you see my first post you will realize that every evolutionary route is locked: It started from the same ancestor, but after then every specie has its own evolution and nothing is happened now for examples to monkeys in order to give them the ability to evolve in a higher intelligence level, ie to become something like a human being. Anyway, I thought that here in RG we can discuss in a different way than like being in a church of a dominant dogma (where if you say something outside the mainstream you will be punished), but I realized that the mentality of the specialists is very similar to those priests that sometimes scientists take as an example to be avoided: "we are scientists, not priests". Sorry, guys but this is similar to a religion, at least for me. As for the main core: I suggest you to do 3 things: 1)relax, it is just a forum 2)read Hesiodos with open mind, without taking every word as exactly its meaning, in order to realize that there have been other 4 evolutionary eras in humanity and we are the fifth attempt 3)after all you read in Hesiodos, think that 200 years of theories is a very small time for such a so strong selfish behaviour. Bye to everybody, I am sorry to realize that modern science and old style religion have so many, so many similar characteristics... 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Andrew Derksen Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service "Every evolutionary route is locked". I suspect that you are not adequately expressing your hypothesis. You're not looking at dogma or ideology, you're starting to ask some of the interesting questions that first year students of biology often ask. You're late to the party. Fortunately, there have been a number of theorists and philosophers who have attempted to address or resolve your questions over the decades. As an example, one of the central themes to Steven Jay Gould's "Wonderful Life" (1990) is to ask the question: if we started the game of life all over again, would it play out in identical fashion? Would we end up with the same phylogenetic diversity we currently have, or might meter-long Anomalocaridids still hunt somewhere along coastal reefs, and mammals never arrived? Alas, this is mostly a rhetorical question. Paleontology is inevitably a historic science; the experiment has already been run and you try and extract what you can from the data. It is very difficult to set up an experiment testing the likelihood of any particular taxon to develop a particular adaptation in response to a particular selective challenge or within a set of unique environmental conditions. There have been some interesting studies with clonal organisms like fungi and bacteria that suggest that minor variations leading to mutation (even among clones!) can be stochastic and therefore similar ancestors can produce very divergent results when you repeat the experiment. These are tough experiments to run, and one needs a large number of test subjects and a long time to run them. On the other end of the spectrum, one of the major "trends" in evolution has been "convergence", in that similar environmental conditions tend to channel organisms into similar bauplan with similar adaptations. The classic example of evolutionary convergence is to compare sharks to the extinct icthyosaurs (aquatic reptiles) and dolphins (aquatic mammals). They share similar body shapes in response to the constraints of their aquatic environment: the laws of physics suggest that this form is a very efficient body shape for a predator to push through water towards prey. Separate lineages, but they all acheived very similar solutions to the problem of moving through water. Why then, as you suggest, have more species not evolved into apparently sentient social organisms? Probably for the same reason that not every lineage has evolved a large-bodied aquatic predator. This ties into a concept related to convergence: competitive inhibition. Not ever major lineage of animals can have a representative fast-moving predator plying the ocean simultaneously. The mammals do not arrive as major aquatic predators until after the reptiles go extinct in the late Cretaceous. Your an economist, so I will draw an analogy: the prominence and sheer success of reptiles as predators prevented a new competitor from entering the market - the entrance costs were too high, and the available competitive niches had already been filled by sharks (who persist undefeated) and reptiles. The human brand of intelligence may be a rare response for a lineage to develop to solve the problem of being alive. Now that it has arrived, it may be difficult for other organisms to develop that same kind of social intelligence and problem-solving capacity that we utilize because we outcompete them in that market. That said, I'd take a good long look at crows, parrots, raccoons, coatis, octopi, and most of the other primates. They are all adept tool-users with some form of social structure - what separates them from us is mostly a matter of degree, and not one of kind. They are all on the list of potential candidates to replace humanity as the primary technology-using species should we drive ourselves (or be helped) into extinction. If you have a couple dozen spare planets or alternate universes to borrow as replicates, and at least a quarter million years to run the experiment, I'd love to see the results. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester "Your an economist..." -> You are an economist..." :-) 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Reinhard Stindl Alpharm Inc., Austria It would be great, if at least some of the contemporary researchers would read the old literature again.

Article  The telomeric sync model of speciation: Species-wide telomer... 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Reinhard Stindl Alpharm Inc., Austria Dear Aria, I don't understand your posting. Nobody says that there was a recent creation. The problem is that the modern synthesis (neo-Darwinism) predicts a gradualistic phenotypic change of species and very long time spans, but the fossil record shows a saltatory pattern. I give you an example from the paper mentioned above: "In his book The New Evolutionary Timetable, the American paleontologist Steven M. Stanley convincingly describes what the major problems of Darwinism and the modern evolutionary synthesis are. He states that the Pleistocene sediments at thousands of collecting sites have uncovered at least 85 % of the mammalian species living today, and therefore the fossil record can no longer be regarded as providing an incomplete picture of evolution (Stanley 1984, p. 97). Most importantly, Stanley mentions the puzzling paleontological fact that within less than 12 million years, most of the living orders of mammals developed, including such diverse animals as lions, wolves, bears, horses, rhinos, deer, pigs, antelopes, sheep, bats and whales, all having descended from a tiny animal resembling a small rodent (Stanley 1984, p. 93). He further concluded: “We can now show that fossil mammal populations assigned to a particular Cenozoic lineage typically span the better part of a million years without displaying sufficient net change to be recognized as a new species. (...) If an average chronospecies lasts nearly a million years, or even longer, and we have at our disposal only ten million years, then we have only ten or 15 chronospecies to align, end-to-end, to form a continuous lineage connecting our primitive little mammal with a bat or a whale” (Stanley 1984, p. 93). “Our only reasonable recourse is to abandon gradualism in favor of punctuated evolution, which can account for the rapid changes for which we see evidence. These changes must have been brought about by strongly divergent steps that came in rapid succession” (Stanley 1984, p. 90)." 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Charles H Stirton University of Cape Town I was intrigued by Peter Richerson's response,easpcially the sentence: "· The most interesting part of the story is that language evolution is led by pre-pubescent girls. Women are more verbal than men and tend to speak more "advanced" versions of local dialects" I have had a long interest in the diversity and evolution of languages, especially as its greatest diversity. With an added  fascination with history I have long pondered the impact that women who were unfortunate to be caputred or enslaved  might have had on the development and spread of bilingualism, dialects, religion, myths, and languages generally. We forget that slavery is very old and something which has happened for most of human history. I think the role of women in language development has been significant but I have not read any real analysis of it. Perhaps others might enlighten me. Another puzzle for me is the Cheetah and the Lion which are genetically very close yet so fundamentally different in habit, physiognomy, and ethology. Doe snayone know when they diverged? In the organisms that I study (Fabaceae) there are some genera with over 70 species yet which have a crown clade age of less than 2 million years. I know of other examples in other genera (eg. Andean Lupinus). That is rapid evolution indeed. Finally,  Economists differentiate between arithmetic growth and geometric growth. Perhaps these are at play in the evolutionary lottery and it is molecualr pathway complexity that is evolving differentailly? 4 years ago Benjamin Cornelius Ruth Not applicable I apologise for my lateness in joining this post (in some ways 23 years). But what delicious answers and examples. And so refreshing to see linguistics and economics in the fray. So, please forgive my possibly outdated and rusty triple of "what if's" around the philosophy of William of Ockham's famous razor but I am somewhat saddened that Neo-Darwinism is still appearing to force awkward timescales into the paradigm of random mutation separate from environmental drivers as the "blind clock maker" of life's staggering complexity. To whit: 1. What if saltatory and explosive speciation along with evolutionary conservatism actually are exactly what they appear to be and rates of evolution are largely independent of the inefficiency of expressions of chance mutation at given loci? 2. What if "natural selection" exists as only a (small) part of the majority of evolution processes? And really, the crux of the argument (as such as it is): 3. Wouldn't pure natural selection in the first instance select those individuals and populations that were able to evolve, or not evolve, efficiently and in concert with the environment in which they live? I posit that as an argument in logic unfettered by perceived wisdom and current paradigms these are three points worthy of proper consideration (the last particularly). The simplest explanations for the phenomena of the diversity of life that we observe around us and in the the fossil record (for example the explosive post Cretaceous Pleistocene mammal divergence mentioned above) are probably correct. What the mechanisms might be is surely where it becomes fun again. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Christopher James Davia @Demitris, I think that the answer to your question is that we are here. Monkeys will only evolve into a new niche if it is free. Also, your perspective assumes some sort of innate driving force to evolve. My own view is  that it is the environment that drives evolution. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Nick Dana Lawrence Waters There is a lot of merit to saltational evolution; in particular to chromosomal re-arrangement, duplication.  Novel body plans and adaptation arise from replicate DNA that then drifts.  Gould's ideas were good, but needed molecular verification. The jury is still out, but the evidence is piling up. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Reinhard Stindl Alpharm Inc., Austria There were many others before Gould, who insisted in saltatory evolution. Theodor Eimer, Otto H. Schindwolf and Richard Goldschmidt. Unfortunately, the gradualistic model prevailed. Please read Otto H.

I had forgotten the paleontological literature. 4 years ago Kenneth Pharr Dalton State College Yes, if you take Scott Aaronson's ideologies ( a professor at MIT) he mathematically shows that genetic mutations are not commpletly random, but rather randomly guided. This meaning evolution does not have to back peddle, but rather when a mutation happens (and doesn't help) the species dies off, but if it does favor the species it stays around. By this method there would need far less time for a certain species to evolve. Thus, proving Darwin's theory of natural selection. 4 years ago Benjamin Cornelius Ruth Not applicable And it's not beyond reason to expect Natural Selection per se to have long ago (the Pre-Cambrian phylogenetic explosion is a tempting conjecture on this point) to favour those species that develop a range of abilities to evolve efficiently in concert with environmental conditions and therefore bring evolution out of the cold and more in line with the negative homeostatic physiological feedback loops that define the natural world yet are not permitted in the world of the Neo-Darwinist. If the visible evidence is accepted at face value through the simple application of Occam’s Razor the paradox of saltatory (e.g. explosive speciation in new habitat e.g. Lake Malawi cichlids and after major extinction events) and conservative evolution seen in both the fossil record and in species extant today will  be seen for what it is instead of the increasingly fraught epicycles of explanation of an increasingly marginalised Neo-Darwinism paradigm of random mutations at a specific loci as the main driver of evolution. With a little more open-minded approach to research in this field it might be discovered that life long ago learnt the ability to shape its own future by reducing the vast and unpredictable waste of random expressed mutation through various strategies to diversify or to retain stasis as the situation requires. What those mechanisms might be, and following the logic of from observations there may be at least two (to conserve or to evolve) then evolutionary biology may finally escape the strictures of a well over past sell date theory. When this long overdue paradigm shift does occur (I certainly expected it to have happened by now and it’s a sad testament to the conservativeness of our times that it hasn’t despite the masses of evidence to the contrary) then, and only then, would evolutionists have a coherent argument against intelligent design and creationists per se. Reading this back I see I have clearly crossed into the realms of fancy where the integrity of rigorous and imaginative scientific enquiry has trumped self-perpetuating conservatism. The reality appears instead that the ideals of the scientific method have been subsumed by ever tighter involuted circles of the scientific establishment no doubt reinforced by ever safer funding requests in the face of ever tighter funding availability maintained by the self-congratulatory clique of the current paradigm’s fundamentalists. In such way does science discredit itself and in such ways does it show that, as in religion, it too can fall to the ego and the unimaginative human slaves of doctrine. 1 Recommendation 2 years ago Erkki J. Brändas Uppsala University My answer would be no. For a recent argument see the reference to Rosenberg (2013 ) below. Note that I refer to the quote below as an improbable statement that has a physicalist content, not yet complete. Alexander Rosenberg, well-known philosopher of physics says by referring to adaptation as an asymmetric process (i) driven by the second law, and (ii) requiring it to be wasteful processes, using up more order in producing adaptations than the order that the adaptations constitute and maintain, writing: It’s clear that the only way to build adaptations consistent with these two requirements is to start by processes that randomly build large numbers of alternative molecular structures just through the operation of thermodynamic noise and then wait. Wait for what? For one or more molecules to turn up randomly that combines thermodynamic stability with replicability.  Eventually out of shear thermodynamic noise there may come to be a molecular structure sufficient to withstand the local environment and that also encourages the emergence of copies of itself out of the atoms floating around in the thermodynamic noise . This can happen by templating, catalysing or otherwise producing copies of itself. You probably don’t have to wait more than 500 million years , once the chemical constituents of the early earth were around for this to start to happen. Once it does happen, iteration of the same process will produce more and more adaptation, at greater and greater expense, just as the 2d law requires. The crucial question is whether we have “at home” all the laws of nature needed to understand how evolution do indeed “produce us”. 2 Recommendations 2 years ago Mark McMenamin Mount Holyoke College In reply to Erkki Brändas, I would say that the most difficult (and fastest?) major leap in evolution was the first one, the biopoesis transition from non-life to life. If you add an additional factor, namely, the fact that the primordial or Haldane Soup is loaded with toxic compounds able to poison any synthetic pathway you can imagine, then not only is there insufficient time, it may be mathematically impossible. Vladimir Vernadsky made Oparin furious with his talk of bio-inert matter, inert matter, etc. to illustrate his view that life was as old as matter and energy. Vernadsky thus became the first to stare deeply into this greatest and most gaping chasm in our scientific landscape. 1 Recommendation 2 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester Yes. The time constants we know have been obtained by observation of what is happening now. Time constants could have been different in the past. Also, this is not a simple linear problem and, as chaos theory tells us, if there was a lucky break early on, then the whole thing would be much quicker. Finally, the good old argument: We are here. Or you guys believe that the gods were astronauts? 2 Recommendations 2 years ago Erkki J. Brändas Uppsala University Dear Mark, Thanks for your comments. In a sense I agree that there is a gap in "our scientific landscape". Note for instance the critical statements made by Thomas Nagel in "MIND & COSMOS: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False", Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York. The book did cause an uproar amongst physicists and philosophers, but despite many negative recensions, I have not seen any serious argument against the neo-Vernadsky criticism of a "gaping chasm". Chemical reactions produce large molecules but do not provide adaptation. Furthermore Neo-Darwinistic laws , including natural selection and the genetic code depend on causal forces and teleonomic laws (see Mayr for definition) and moreover, causality is needed to instigate adaptation. Therefore physics cannot rule out either causality, despite their absence on the fundamental microscopic level, nor progressions that rely on encoded processes . By indiscriminately ruling out intentionality one risks “throwing out the baby with the bath water”. An extension of the picture, contained in Rosenberg's quote, is necessarily needed in order to rigorously contain adaptability in general and the genetic code in particular, including its more subtle variations, as closed or open programs, mapping various evolutionary situations, like for instance those for insects or humans. 2 years ago Erkki J. Brändas Uppsala University I have voiced an opinion, based on my professional life as chemical physicist.

Chapter · Jan 2012 Ahmad Atif Ahmad Read Theological philosophy: Rethinking the rationality of Christian faith [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT:  For much of the modern period, theologians and philosophers of religion have struggled with the problem of proving that it is rational to believe in God. Drawing on the thought of Thomas Aquinas, Theological Philosophy seeks to overturn the longstanding problem of proving faith's rationality and to establish instead that rationality requires to be explained by appeals to faith. Building on a constructive argument developed in a companion book, Rationality as Virtue, Lydia Schumacher advances the conclusion that belief in the God of Christian faith provides an exceptionally robust rationale for rationality and is as such intrinsically rational. At the same time, Schumacher overcomes a common tendency to separate spiritual from ordinary life, and construes the latter as the locus of proof for the rationality of Christian faith.

MORRIS, PH.D.  | SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 01, 2003             Download
        The Mathematical Impossibility Of Evolution        PDF     ICR began publishing its popular free newsletter Acts & Facts in June 1972, over 31 years ago. The first two issues were 6-page, single-column, fold-over tract-like papers, black-and-white—not very impressive in appearance.  Issue No. 1 contained only news items describing some of our early campus meetings. Specially featured was the meeting held by Dr. Duane Gish on the Davis campus of the University of California. This was the meeting that involved an unscheduled 2½ hour debate with world-famous evolutionist, G. Ledyard Stebbins. A favorable response from the large student attendance and a very positive write-up in the student paper eventually led to Dr. Gish's famous cartoon booklet, Have You Been Brainwashed? which has been greatly used by the Lord in the past three decades, being distributed in the millions all over the world.  That issue also announced the publication of Dr. Gish's first book, Evolution: The Fossils Say No! which has been used widely and has won many evolutionists to accept the truth of special creation.  Issue No. 2 also was mostly news, but it did contain a semi-technical article on "The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution" which is being reproduced herein as a matter of interest—not only of historical interest as the forerunner of our popular Impact articles (the first of which was published in the first 1973 issue), but also because it still seems to show in a very simple way that evolution is impossible—no one, to my knowledge, has ever tried to refute it.  The third issue of Acts & Facts reported on the first ICR-sponsored expedition to Mount Ararat in search of Noah's Ark, led by John Morris. The first Impact article, however, was published in the January/February 1973 issue on the subject, "Evolution, Creation, and the Public Schools , " urging that concerned citizens should use an educational and persuasion approach, rather than legislation or litigation, in trying to get a balanced approach to origins teaching accepted in the public schools.  In spite of this advice, however, many well-meaning creationists have tried—always unsuccessfully—to try to force this issue. We still recommend education and persuasion as the best policy.  Anyway, an Impact article on significant scientific or apologetics topics has been published every month since that first 1973 Acts & Facts . The forerunner of all these, still quite valid, I believe, is reproduced with a few modifications below:  The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution  According to the most-widely accepted theory of evolution today, the sole mechanism for producing evolution is that of random mutation combined with natural selection. Mutations are random changes in genetic systems. Natural selection is considered by evolutionists to be a sort of sieve, which retains the "good" mutations and allows the others to pass away.  Since random changes in ordered systems almost always will decrease the amount of order in those systems, nearly all mutations are harmful to the organisms which experience them. Nevertheless, the evolutionist insists that each complex organism in the world today has arisen by a long string of gradually accumulated good mutations preserved by natural selection. No one has ever actually observed a genuine mutation occurring in the natural environment which was beneficial (that is, adding useful genetic information to an existing genetic code), and therefore, retained by the selection process. For some reason, however, the idea has a certain persuasive quality about it and seems eminently reasonable to many people—until it is examined quantitatively , that is!  For example, consider a very simple putative organism composed of only 200 integrated and functioning parts, and the problem of deriving that organism by this type of process. The system presumably must have started with only one part and then gradually built itself up over many generations into its 200-part organization. The developing organism, at each successive stage, must itself be integrated and functioning in its environment in order to survive until the next stage. Each successive stage, of course, becomes statistically less likely than the preceding one, since it is far easier for a complex system to break down than to build itself up. A four-component integrated system can more easily "mutate" (that is, somehow suddenly change) into a three-component system (or even a four-component non-functioning system) than into a five-component integrated system. If, at any step in the chain, the system mutates "downward," then it is either destroyed altogether or else moves backward, in an evolutionary sense.  Therefore, the successful production of a 200-component functioning organism requires, at least , 200 successive, successful such "mutations," each of which is highly unlikely. Even evolutionists recognize that true mutations are very rare, and beneficial mutations are extremely rare—not more than one out of a thousand mutations are beneficial, at the very most.  But let us give the evolutionist the benefit of every consideration. Assume that, at each mutational step, there is equally as much chance for it to be good as bad. Thus, the probability for the success of each mutation is assumed to be one out of two, or one-half. Elementary statistical theory shows that the probability of 200 successive mutations being successful is then (½) 200 , or one chance out of 10 60 . The number 10 60 , if written out, would be "one" followed by sixty "zeros." In other words, the chance that a 200-component organism could be formed by mutation and natural selection is less than one chance out of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion! Lest anyone think that a 200-part system is unreasonably complex, it should be noted that even a one-celled plant or animal may have millions of molecular "parts."  The evolutionist might react by saying that even though any one such mutating organism might not be successful, surely some around the world would be, especially in the 10 billion years (or 10 18 seconds) of assumed earth history. Therefore, let us imagine that every one of the earth's 10 14 square feet of surface harbors a billion (i.e., 10 9 ) mutating systems and that each mutation requires one-half second (actually it would take far more time than this). Each system can thus go through its 200 mutations in 100 seconds and then, if it is unsuccessful, start over for a new try. In 10 18 seconds, there can, therefore, be 10 18 /10 2 , or 10 16 , trials by each mutating system. Multiplying all these numbers together, there would be a total possible number of attempts to develop a 200-component system equal to 10 14 (10 9 ) (10 16 ), or 10 39 attempts. Since the probability against the success of any one of them is 10 60 , it is obvious that the probability that just one of these 10 39 attempts might be successful is only one out of 10 60 /10 39 , or 10 21 .  All this means that the chance that any kind of a 200-component integrated functioning organism could be developed by mutation and natural selection just once, anywhere in the world, in all the assumed expanse of geologic time, is less than one chance out of a billion trillion. What possible conclusion, therefore, can we derive from such considerations as this except that evolution by mutation and natural selection is mathematically and logically indefensible!  Discussion   There have been many other ways in which creationist writers have used probability arguments to refute evolutionism, especially the idea of random changes preserved, if beneficial, by natural selection. James Coppedge devoted almost an entire book, Evolution: Possible or Impossible (Zondervan, 1973, 276 pp.), to this type of approach. I have also used other probability-type arguments to the same end (see, e.g., Science and Creation , Master Books, pp. 161-201).  The first such book, so far as I know, to use mathematics and probability in refuting evolution was written by a pastor, W. A. Williams, way back in 1928. Entitled, Evolution Disproved , it made a great impression on me when I first read it about 1943, at a time when I myself was still struggling with evolution.  In fact, evolutionists themselves have attacked traditional Darwinism on the same basis (see the Wistar Institute Symposium, Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution, 1967, 140 pp.). While these scientists did not reject evolution itself, they did insist that the Darwinian randomness postulate would never work.  Furthermore, since the law of increasing entropy, or the second law of thermodynamics, is essentially a statement of probabilities, many writers have also used that law itself to show that evolution on any significant scale is essentially impossible. Evolutionists have usually ignored the arguments or else used vacuous arguments against them ("Anything can happen given enough time"; "The earth is an open system, so the second law doesn't apply"; "Order can arise out of chaos through dissipative structures"; etc.).  In the real world of scientific observation, as opposed to metaphysical speculation, however, no more complex system can ever "evolve" out of a less complex system, so the probability of the naturalistic origin of even the simplest imaginary form of life is zero.  The existence of complexity of any kind is evidence of God and creation. "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth" ( Isaiah 40:26 ).

MORRIS, PH.D.  | SUNDAY, JULY 01, 1979               One of the strongest direct evidences for special creation is the existence of innumerable highly complex systems in the universe, systems composed of components occurring in a pattern of "order" rather than disorder. Creationists maintain that highly ordered systems could not arise by chance, since random processes generate disorder rather than order, simplicity rather than complexity and confusion instead of "information."  For example, consider a series of ten flash cards, numbered from one to ten. If these are thoroughly and randomly mixed, and then laid out successively in a linear array along the table, it would be extremely unlikely that the numbers would fall out in order from one to ten. Actually, there are 3,628,800 different ways in which these numbers could be arranged, so that the "probability" of this particular ordered arrangement is only one in 3,628,800. (This number is "ten factorial," written as 10!, and can be calculated simply by multiplying together all the numbers from one to ten.)  It is obvious that the probability of such a numerically ordered arrangement decreases rapidly as the number of components increases. For any linear system of 100 components in specified order, the probability is one in 100!, or one chance in 10 158 (a number represented by "one followed by 158 zeroes").  A system requiring such a high degree of order could never happen by chance. This follows from the fact that probability theory only applies to systems with a finite possibility of occurring at least once in the universe, and it would be inconceivable that 10 158 different trials could ever be made in our entire space-time universe.  Astro-physicists estimate that there are no more than 10 80 infinitesimal "particles" in the universe, and that the age of the universe in its present form is no greater than 10 18 seconds (30 billion years). Assuming each particle can participate in a thousand billion (10 12 ) different events every second (this is impossibly high, of course), then the greatest number of events that could ever happen (or trials that could ever be made) in all the universe throughout its entire history is only 10 80 x 10 18 x 10 12 , or 10 110 (most authorities would make this figure much lower, about 10 50 ). Any event with a probability of less than one chance in 10 110 , therefore, cannot occur. Its probability becomes zero, at least in our known universe.  Thus, the above-suggested ordered arrangement of 100 components has a zero probability. It could never happen by chance. Since every single living cell is infinitely more complex and ordered than this, it is impossible that even the simplest form of life could ever have originated by chance. Even the simplest replicating protein molecule that could be imagined has been shown by Golay 1 to have a probability of one in 10 450 . Salisbury 2 calculates the probability of a typical DNA chain to be one in 10 600 .  However, when creationists use this evidence from probability while lecturing or debating on the creation/evolution question, evolutionists often dismiss the evidence as irrelevant, using the clever and confusing argument that no arrangement is more or less probable than any other arrangement, and some arrangement must exist! (See Figure. 1)  For example, suppose the ten flash cards showed up as follows:    This arrangement obviously is unordered in comparison with the ordered arrangement below:    Nevertheless, the evolutionist will say, the unordered arrangement has the same probability (one in 3,628,800, or 10!) as the ordered arrangement. Consequently, since some arrangement is necessary, and any arrangement is just as probable as any other, there is no reason to see any particular significance in the arrangement which happens to occur. Consequently, any argument for design based on probability, they say, is meaningless.  Superficially, this claim may seem logical, even though we immediately sense that something is wrong with it. We know intuitively, as well as experimentally, that ordered arrangements are much less probable than unordered arrangements. Random arrangements of boulders on a hillside, for example, are "natural," whereas the same boulders arranged in a circle would require explanation.  Closer consideration, of course, does quickly reveal that such evolutionary reasoning is specious. If arrangement (a) had, for some reason, been specified beforehand, then its actual occurrence in the shuffle would indeed have been surprising. It could then no longer be considered an unordered arrangement, since it had been "ordered" externally! But it was not specified ahead of time—it was just the luck of the draw. Arrangement (b), however, has intrinsic order and its actual occurrence, therefore, would almost certainly not have been by chance.  This type of evolutionary equivocation crops up in various guises. One debater responded to the creationists' probability argument by calling attention to the particular combination of people in the audience. With all the people in the state, he noted, the probability that this specific group, rather than some other group, would come together by chance was "extremely small, yet there they were! The answer, of course, was that the group had not come together by chance at all—each person had come by direct intent. Nor had the individuals in the group been prespecified, as would have been the case in a designed system, where each component had to occupy a specific position in order for the system to function.  Once in a while, the objection is a little more subtle. The fact that a certain ordered structure, functioning in a specific way, seems to have an infinitesimal probability of origin by chance is side-stepped by asserting that if some other chance assemblage had come together, it may have functioned in some other way. Evolution might then have taken a different direction. The present functioning system is merely the natural development from the components that happened to come together, and this is no less probable than any other assemblage that might have evolved differently.  But this tenuous argument implicitly assumes that any chance aggregation of particles will contain some amount of "information" and, therefore, will have some kind of evolutionary potential. Such a belief is gratuitous and naive, to say the least, when all real experience indicates the exact opposite. That is, it is far easier and more common to generate something disordered and useless than something organized and functioning.  One cannot simply pull a working system out of a hat full of random particles. The system must possess the requisite "information" before it can get anywhere or do anything constructive. It must be organized in some kind of pattern, and patterns do not usually appear spontaneously. They are not inevitable, as the above evolutionary argument implies, but extremely rare.  For example, although one could arrange the ten flash cards in a number of possible "ordered" patterns, the number is quite limited. There seems to be a certain amount of "information" in each of the arrangements shown below, but it is obvious that arrangements (b) and (c) are more "ordered," containing more information than any of the others. Arrangement (a), as noted earlier, contains no real order or information—it is strictly "random." No doubt a few other arrangements could be devised with a small amount of order to them, but only a few (See Figure 2).    To be generous, however, let us assume that as many as 100 patterns could be devised for the ten cards which would contain some modicum of order. Each of these would have some amount of "information" and therefore, might theoretically be able to specify some sort of wobbly function. This is entirely speculative, of course, since the only one which is known to be functional is the ideal pattern, as defined in arrangement (b).  Even at best, however, there would be only 100 possible functional arrangements, leaving 3,628,700 completely unordered, and, therefore, non-functional arrangements, a ratio of over 36,000 to one. That is, the odds are at least 36,000 to one against any random assemblage of ten components into a meaningful system, which could possibly serve as a base or pattern for anything.  This simple examination merely confirms that which is intuitively obvious anyhow, namely, that disorder in a system is tremendously more probable than any kind of order in that system -- not only one specific pattern, but any kind of pattern! Furthermore, this improbability increases as the number of components in the system increases (See Figure 3 ).    The number of ordered arrangements shown in the table is somewhat arbitrary, of course, but certainly generous. In any event, it is very clear that the probability of the chance occurrence of any kind of "information" in a system is very small, and that this probability rapidly diminishes as the complexity of the system increases.  This means that, whenever one sees any kind of real ordered complexity in nature, particularly as found in living systems, he can be sure this complexity was designed.  One must conclude that, contrary to the established and current wisdom, a scenario describing the genesis  of life on earth by chance and natural causes which can be accepted on the basis of fact and not faith has not yet been written. 3 I believed we developed this practice (i.e., of postulating prebiological natural selection) to avoid facing the conclusion that the probability of a self-replicating state is zero… When for practical purposes the concept of infinite time and matter has to be invoked, that concept of probability is annulled. 4  There is still one other evolutionary equivocation to be noted, however. What chance cannot accomplish, evolutionists glibly attribute to natural selection.  So natural selection as a process is okay. We are also pretty sure that it goes on in nature although good examples are surprisingly rare. The best evidence comes from the many cases where it can be shown that biological structures have been optimized—that is, structures that represent optimal engineering solutions to the problems that an animal has of feeding or escaping predators or generally functioning in its environment ...The presence of these optimal structures does not, of course, prove that they developed through natural selection, but it does provide strong circumstantial argument. 5  This is a rather typical example of the way evolutionists bypass even the strongest evidences for design. Dr. Raup, with his doctorate from Harvard, is a highly competent geologist, serving as Curator of Geology at Chicago's great Field Museum, and formerly as Professor of Geology at the University of Rochester. He candidly acknowledges the complete absence of transitional forms in the fossil record and the complete absence of evidence for observable progressive evolution.  Instead of finding the gradual unfolding of life, what geologists of Darwin's time, and geologists of the present day actually find is a highly uneven or jerky record; that is, species appear in the sequence very suddenly, show little or no change during their existence in the record, then abruptly go out of the record. And it is not always clear, in fact it's rarely clear, that the descendants were actually better adapted than their predecessors. In other words, biological improvement is hard to find. 6  Thus, in spite of the utter lack of evidence in either living populations or the fossil record that natural selection ever generates higher orders of complexity (or "biological improvement," or "better adaptation") the mere existence of "optimal structures" is taken by evolutionists as confirmation of the remarkable power of natural selection!  But, of course, such a process as natural selection does not even exist at the prebiological level! Whatever effect selection may possibly have had on random processes in later biological reproduction, it is clear beyond any rational argument that chance processes could never have produced even the simplest forms of life in the first place. Without a living God to create life, the laws of probability and complexity prove beyond doubt that life could never come into existence at all.

Home The Probability of Life       Creationists have long asserted that the chances of life forming naturally are so remote that they could not have happened. Read about how, in fact, the chances are much wider than most think.  by Richard Peacock      Creationists often claim that the chances of a modern enzyme forming by random means are astronomically small, and therefore the chances of a complete bacterium (which is composed of hundreds or thousands of such enzymes & proteins) is so near to impossible that it would never happen in the 13 billion years or so since the universe took shape.  The main problem with this argument is that it assumes abiogenesis (the initial formation of life from simpler molecules) was a totally random process. It also assumes that in order for abiogenesis to be successful, a complete microbe would have had to form spontaneously. In fact, the same non-random forces which propel biological evolution also propelled abiogenesis. Specifically, Natural Selection.  The calculation which supports the creationist argument begins with the probability of a 300-molecule-long protein forming by total random chance. This would be approximately 1 chance in 10 390 . This number is astoundingly huge. By comparison, the number of all the atoms in the observable universe is 10 80 . So, if a simple protein has that unlikely chance of forming, what hope does a complete bacterium have?  If this were the theory of abiogeneisis, and if it relied entirely on random chance, then yes, it would be impossible for life to form in this way. However, this is not the case.  Abiogenesis was a long process with many small incremental steps, all governed by the non-random forces of Natural Selection and chemistry. The very first stages of abiogenesis were no more than simple self-replicating molecules, which might hardly have been called alive at all.  For example, the simplest theorized self-replicating peptide is only 32 amino acids long. The probability of it forming randomly, in sequential trials, is approximately 1 in 10 40 , which is much more likely than the 1 in 10 390 claim creationists often cite.  Though, to be fair, 10 40 is still a very large number. It would still take an incredibly large number of sequential trials before the peptide would form. But remember that in the prebiotic oceans of the early Earth, there would be billions of trials taking place simultaneously as the oceans, rich in amino acids, were continuously churned by the tidal forces of the moon and the harsh weather conditions of the Earth.  In fact, if we assume the volume of the oceans were 10 24 liters, and the amino acid concentration was 10 -6 M (which is actually very dilute), then almost 10 31 self-replicating peptides would form in under a year, let alone millions of years. So, even given the difficult chances of 1 in 10 40 , the first stages of abiogenesis could have started very quickly indeed.   Please note: this article uses a hypothetical self-replicating peptide as a model molecule for these calculations.  The current theories of abiogenesis are usually based on the "RNA World" theory, where in fact self-replication was first acheived through RNA molecules, rather than DNA molecules.  See the references below for more information on the RNA World Theory.

Bailey 14 February 2018 (c) 2018  Introduction Both traditional creationists and intelligent design writers have invoked probability arguments in criticisms of biological evolution. They argue that certain features of biology are so fantastically improbable that they could never have been produced by a purely natural, "random" process, even assuming the billions of years of history asserted by geologists and astronomers.  They often equate the hypothesis of evolution to the absurd suggestion that monkeys randomly typing at a typewriter could compose a selection from the works of Shakepeare, or that an explosion in an aerospace equipment yard could produce a working 747 airliner [ Dembski1998 ; Foster1991 ; Hoyle1981 ; Lennox2009 ]. One creationist-intelligent design argument goes like this: the human alpha-globin molecule, a component of hemoglobin that performs a key oxygen transfer function, is a protein chain based on a sequence of 141 amino acids.  There are 20 different amino acids common in living systems, so the number of potential chains of length 141 is 20 141 , which is roughly 10 183 (i.e., a one followed by 183 zeroes).  These writers argue that this figure is so enormous that even after billions of years of random molecular trials, no human alpha-globin protein molecule would ever appear "at random," and thus the hypothesis that human alpha-globin arose by an evolutionary process is decisively refuted  [ Foster1991 , pg. 79-83; Hoyle1981 , pg. 1-20; Lennox2009 , pg. 163-173]. The treacherous world of probability and statistics While not generally appreciated by the public at large, it is a well-known fact in the world of scientific research that arguments based on probability and statistics are fraught with potential fallacies and errors. For these reasons, rigorous courses in probability and statistics are now required of students in virtually all fields of science, and in numerous other disciplines as well.  Attorneys need to be at least moderately well-versed in probability and statistics arguments and how they can go awry in the courtroom arguments [ Saini2009 ]. In the finance world, statistical overfitting and other errors of probability and statistics are now thought to be a leading reason behind the fact that strategies and investment funds which look great on paper often disappoint in real-world usage [ Bailey2014 ]. To illustrate the difficulties with probability arguments, mathematics teachers often ask their class (let's say it has 30 students) if they think it is likely that two or more persons in the class have exactly the same birthday.  Most students say that it is highly unlikely, thinking that the chances that two people have the same particular birthday is 1/365, and so 30 times this amount is only 30/365. But this argument is fallacious, since, for example, in a class of 30 students there are 435 pairs of students.  When the probability calculation is done correctly for the case of 30 students [it is equal to 1 - (364/365 x 363/365 x ... x 336/365)], one obtains 70.6%.  In general, if there are 23 or more students in the class, then the chances that two or more have the same birthday is greater than 50%. For numerous other examples of how seemingly improbable "coincidences" can happen, see [ Hand2014 ]. Fallacies in the creationist probability arguments One major fallacy in the alpha-globin argument mentioned above, common to many others of this genre, is that it ignores the fact that a large class of alpha-globin molecules can perform the essential oxygen transfer function, so that the computation of the probability of a single instance is misleadingly remote.  Indeed, most of the 141 amino acids in alpha-globin can be changed without altering the key oxygen transfer function, as can be seen by noting the great variety in alpha-globin molecules across the animal kingdom (see DNA ).
When one revises the calculation above, based on only 25 locations essential for the oxygen transport function (which is a generous over-estimate), one obtains 10 33 fundamentally different chains, a enormous figure but vastly smaller than 10 183 . A calculation such as this can be refined further, taking into account other features of alpha-globin and its related biochemistry.  Some of these calculations produce probability values even more extreme than the above.  But do any of these calculations really matter? The main problem is that all such calculations, whether done accurately or not, suffer from the fatal fallacy of presuming that a structure such as human alpha-globin arose by a single all-at-once random trial event. But generating a molecule "at random" in a single shot is decidedly not the scientific hypothesis in question -- this is a creationist theory, not a scientific theory.  Instead, available evidence from hundreds of published studies on the topic has demonstrated that alpha-globin arose as the end product of a long sequence of intermediate steps, each of which was biologically useful in an earlier context.  See, for example, the survey article [ Hardison2001 ], which cites 144 papers on the topic of hemoglobin evolution. In short, it does not matter how good or how bad the mathematics used in the analysis is, if the underlying model is a fundamentally invalid description of the phenomenon in question.  Any simplistic probability calculation of evolution that does not take into account the step-by-step process by which the structure came to be is almost certainly fallacious and can easily mislead [ Musgrave1998 ]. What's more, such calculations completely ignore the atomic-level biochemical processes involved, which often exhibit strong affinities for certain types of highly ordered structures.  For example, molecular self-assembly occurs in DNA molecule duplication every time a cell divides.  If we were to compute the chances of the formation of a human DNA molecule during meiosis, using a simple-minded probability calculation similar to that mentioned above, the result would be something on the order of one in 10 1,000,000,000 , which is far, far beyond the possibility of "random" assemblage.  Yet this process occurs millions of times every day in the human body. Is evolution a "random" process? It is also important to keep in mind that the process of natural biological evolution is not really a "random" process.  Evolution certainly has some "random" aspects, notably mutations and genetic events during reproduction.  But the all-important process of natural selection, acting under the pressure of an extremely competitive landscape, often involving thousands of other individuals of the same species and other species as well, together with numerous complicated environmental pressures such as climate change, is anything but random.  This strongly directional nature of natural selection, which is the essence of evolution, by itself invalidates most of these probability calculations. Hemoglobin and chlorophyll With regards to hemoglobin, in particular, it has long been noted that heme, the key oxygen-carrying component of hemoglobin, is remarkably similar to chlorophyll, the molecule behind photosynthesis.  The principal difference is that heme has a central iron atom, whereas chlorophyll has a central magnesium atom; otherwise they are virtually identical.  This similarity can hardly be a coincidence, and in fact researchers concluded long ago that these two biomolecules must have shared a common lineage (meaning, of course, that organisms which incorporate these biomolecules must have shared a common lineage) [ Hendry1980 ].  Here is a diagram of the two molecules [from MasterOrganicChemistry.com ]:   Snowflakes Some of the difficulties with creationist probability arguments can be illustrated by considering snowflakes.  Bentley and Humphrey's book Snow Crystals includes over 2000 high-resolution black-and-white photos of real snowflakes, each with intricate yet highly regular patterns that are almost perfectly six-way symmetric [ Bentley1962 ].  A good online source with numerous high-resolution photographs has been compiled by Kenneth Libbrecht [ Libbrecht2012 ].  Four of Bentley's photos are shown below.  By employing a reckoning based on six-way symmetry, one can calculate the chances that one of these structures can form "at random" as roughly one part in 10 2500 .  This probability figure is even more extreme than some that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature.  So is this proof that each individual snowflake has been designed by a supernatural intelligent entity?  Obviously not. The fallacy here, once again, is presuming an all-at-once random assembly of molecules.  Instead, snowflakes, like biological organisms, are formed as the product of a long series of steps acting under well-known physical laws, and the outcomes of such processes very sensitively depend on the starting conditions and numerous environmental parameters.  It is thus folly to presume that one can correctly reckon the chances of a given outcome by means of superficial probability calculations that ignore the processes by which they formed.        Can English text be generated "at random"? As mentioned above, some critics have equated the notion of natural evolution to the absurd suggestion that some monkeys typing randomly at a keyboard could generate a passage of Shakespeare.  But this too is a fallacious argument. A recent study exhibited results of a computer program simulating natural evolution, which "evolved" segments of English text very much akin to actual passages from Charles Dickens.  In many instances, a class of college students were unable to distinguish the computer-generated text segments from real text segments taken from Dickens' Great Expectations .  See English-text for details. Along this line, computer programs have been written that mimic the process of biological evolution to produce novel solutions to engineering problems, in many cases superior to the best human efforts, in an approach that has been termed "genetic algorithms" or "evolutionary computing."  As a single example, in 2017 Google researchers generated 1000 image recognition algorithms, each of which were trained using state-of-the-art deep neural networks to recognize a selected set of images.  They then used an array of 250 computers, each running two algorithms, to identify an image.  Only the algorithm that scored higher proceeded to the next iteration, where it was changed somewhat, mimicking mutations in natural evolution. Google researchers found that their scheme could achieve accuracies as high as 94.6% [ Gershgorn2017 ]. Closely related are advances in artificial intelligence, in which a set of computer programs "compete" to produce a superior program.  One notable example is the 2016 defeat of the world's top Go player by a computer program named AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, in an event that surprised observers who had not expected this for decades, if ever.  Then in 2017, DeepMind announced even more remarkable results: their researchers had started from scratch, programming a computer with only the rules of Go, together with a "deep learning" algorithm, and then had the program play games against itself.  Within a few days it had advanced to the point that it defeated the earlier champion-beating AlphaGo program 100 games to zero.  After one month, the program's rating was as far above the world champion as the world champion was above a typical amateur [ Greenmeier2017 ]. As an example of the many mathematical studies of evolution, researchers showed mathematically that there was plenty of time in the geologic record for evolution to have produced the complexity in nature [ Wilf2010 ]. Improbable structures and features in nature Numerous examples from the natural world can be cited to demonstrate the futility of trying to argue against evolution using probability -- nature can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features, by the normal process of evolution:  Lenski's 2012 E. coli experiment : In January 2012, a research team led by Richard Lenski at Michigan State University demonstrated that colonies of viruses can evolve a new trait in as little as 15 days.  The researchers studied a virus, known as "lambda," which infects only the bacterium E. coli.  They engineered a strain of E. coli that had almost none of the molecules that this virus normally attaches to, then released them into the virus colony.  In 24 of 96 separate experimental lines, the viruses evolved a strain that enabled them to attach to E. coli, using a new molecule that they had never before been observed to utilize.  All of the successful runs utilized essentially the same set of four distinct mutations.  Justin Meyer, a member of the research team, noted that the chances of all four mutations arising "at random" in a given experimental line (based on a superficial probability argument) are roughly one in 10 27 (one thousand trillion trillion) [ Zimmer2012 ].  Note also that the chances for this to happen in 24 out of 96 experimental lines are roughly one in 10 626 .   Synthesis of RNA nucleotides and other biomolecules :  Many scientists hypothesize that RNA (a molecule similar to DNA) was involved in the origin of life (see Origin ).  But as recently as a few years ago, even producing the four nucleotides (components) of RNA on the primitive Earth was  thought to be a "near miracle."  Nonetheless, in May 2009 a team led by John Sutherland of the University of Manchester discovered a particular combination of chemicals, very likely to have been plentiful on the early Earth, that formed the RNA nucleotide ribocytidine phosphate.  By exposing the mixture to ultraviolet light, a second nucleotide of RNA was formed [ Wade2009 ].  Then in May 2016, one of the remaining two was synthesized, by a team in Munich, Germany [ Service2016 ].  Sutherland's group also recently showed that two simple compounds, which almost certainly were abundant on the early Earth, can launch a cascade of chemical reactions that can produce all three major classes of biomolecules: nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids [ Wade2015a ].  In short, the natural production of biomolecules once thought to be "impossible" is now fairly well understood.   Hawaiian crickets : In the 1990s, a population of crickets in Hawaii (a species introduced to the islands over 100 years ago) became victims of dive-bombing flies that targeted male crickets who were chirping to attract mates, then implanted their larvae in them.  Recently, when researchers visited a region in Kauai that previously was the home to many of these chirping crickets, it was now completely silent, and they feared the crickets were now extinct in the area.  Fortunately, nighttime searches found that in fact there were lots of crickets there, but very few of the males now chirped.  Further study found that in just five years, or roughly 20 generations, a rather improbable mutation had arisen that inhibited the males from chirping, and this genetic trait had now spread to almost the entire population [ Zuk2013 , pg. 81-82].   Tibetan high-altitude genes : In 2010, researchers analyzing DNA found that natives of the Tibetan highlands possess 30 unique genes that permit them to live well at very high altitudes: the genes foster more efficient metabolism, prevent the overproduction of red blood cells, and generate higher levels of substances that transmit oxygen to tissue.  Given that the Tibetans separated from other Han Chinese only about 3,000 years ago, this is thought to be one of the fastest documented cases of evolution in humans [ Wade2010b ].  Many other examples could be listed -- see Novelty and Origin . Dembski's information theory arguments Intelligent design writer William Dembski invokes both probability and information theory (the mathematical theory of information content in data) in his arguments against Darwinism [e.g., Dembski2002 ].  However, mathematicians who have examined Dembski's works have identified major flaws in his reasoning [ Elsberry2011 ].  For a detailed discussion of Dembski's theories, see Information theory . Does creationism provide a reasonable alternative? Does a creationist worldview, in particular the hypothesis of independent creation of each species with no common biological ancestry, provide a reasonable alternative in terms of probability? Here it is instructive to consider transposons or "jumping genes," namely sections of DNA that have been "copied" from one part of an organism's genome and "pasted" seemingly at random in other locations.  The human genome, for example, has over four million individual transposons in over 800 families [ Mills2007 ].  In most cases transposons do no harm, because they "land" in an unused section of DNA, but because they are inherited they serve as excellent markers for genetic studies.  Indeed, transposons have been used to classify a large number of vertebrate species into a family tree, with a result that is virtually identical to what biologists had earlier reckoned based only physical features and biological functions [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92].  As just one example, consider the following table, where columns labeled ABCDE denote five blocks of transposons, and x and o denote that the block is present or absent in the genome [ Rogers2011 , pg. 89]. Transposon blocks
			Species		A	B	C	D	E
        /---------	Human		o	x	x	x	x
       /----------	Bonobo		x	x	x	x	x
      / \---------	Chimp		x	x	x	x	x
     /------------	Gorilla		o	o	x	x	x
-----|------------	Orangutan	o	o	o	x	x
     \------------	Gibbon		o	o	o	o	o It is clear from these data that our closest primate relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos.  As another example, here is a classification of four cetaceans (ocean mammals) based on transposon data  [ Rogers2011 , pg. 27]: Transposon blocks
		Species			A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P
    /------	Bottlenose dolphin	x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
   /\------	Narwhal whale		x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
---|-------	Sperm whale		x  x  x  x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o
   \-------	Humpback whale		x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o Other examples could be listed, encompassing an even broader range of species [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92]. Needless to say, these data, which all but scream "descent from common ancestors," are highly problematic for creationists and others who hold that the individual species were separately created without common biological ancestry.  Transposons typically are several thousand DNA base pair letters long, but, since there are often some disagreements from species to species, let us be very conservative and say only 1000 base pair letters long.  Then for two species to share even one transposon starting at the same spot, presumably only due to random mutations since creation, the probability (according to the creationist hypothesis) is one in 4 1000 or roughly one in 10 600 .  For 16 such common transposons, the chances are one in 4 16000 or roughly one in 10 9600 .  What's more, as mentioned above, an individual species typically has at least several hundred thousand such transposons.  Including even part of these in the reckoning would hugely multiply these odds. But this is not all, because we have not yet considered the fact that in each diagram above, or in other tables of real biological transposon data, there is a clear hierarchical relationship.  This is by no means assured, and in fact is quite improbable -- for almost all tables of "random" data, there is no hierarchical pattern, and no way to the rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern.  For example, in a computer run programmed by the present author, each column of the above cetacean table was pseudorandomly shuffled (thus maintaining the same number of x and o in each column), and the program checked whether the rows of the resulting table could be rearranged to be in a hierarchical order.  There were no successes in 10,000,000 trials.  As a second experiment, a 4 x 16 table of pseudorandom data (with a 50-50 chance of x or o) was generated, and then the program attempted to rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern as before.  There were only three successes in 10,000,000 trials. Like the calculations mentioned earlier, these calculations are simplified and informal; more careful reckonings can be done, and one can vary the underlying assumptions.  But, again, do the fine details of the calculations really matter?  One way or the other, it is clear that the creationist hypothesis of separate creation does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  The only other possibility, from a strict creationist worldview, is to posit that a supreme being separately created species with hundreds of thousands of transposons already in place, essentially just as we see them today.  But this merely replaces a scientific disaster (the utter failure of the creationist model to explain the vast phylogenetic patterns in intron data) with a theological disaster (why did a truth-loving supreme being fill the genomes of the entire biological kingdom with vast amounts of misleading DNA evidence, all pointing unambiguously to an evolutionary descent from common ancestors, if that is not the conclusion we are to draw?).  Indeed, with regards to the discomfort some have about evolution, the creationist alternative of separate creation is arguably far worse, both scientifically and theologically. Conclusions It is undeniably true that there are some perplexing features of evolution from the point of view of probability.  Even at the molecular level, structures are seen that appear to be exceedingly improbable.  What is the origin of these structures?  How did they evolve to the forms we see today?  In spite of many published papers on these topics, researchers in the field would be the first to acknowledge that there is still much that is not yet fully understood. However, arguments based on probability, statistics or information theory that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature do not help unravel these mysteries, because most of these arguments have serious fallacies:  They presume that a given biomolecule came into existence "at random" via an all-at-once chance assemblage of atoms.  But this is not the scientific hypothesis of how they formed; instead, numerous published studies, covering many biomolecules, indicate that these biomolecules were the result of a long series of intermediate steps over the eons, each useful in a previous biological context. Thus such arguments are fundamentally flawed from the beginning.  They apply faulty mathematical reasoning, such as by ignoring the fact that a very wide range of biomolecules could perform a similar function to the given biomolecule.  Thus the odds they provide against the formation of the given biomolecule are greatly exaggerated.  They ignore the fact that biological evolution is fundamentally not a purely "random" process -- mutations may be random, but natural selection is far from random.  They ignore reams of evidence from the natural world that evolution can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features.  Some writers attempt to invoke advanced mathematical concepts (e.g., information theory), but derive highly questionable results and misapply these results in ways that render the conclusions invalid in an evolutionary biology context.  The creationist hypothesis of separate creation for each species does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  It is ironic that to the extent that such probability-based arguments have any validity at all, it is precisely the creationist hypothesis of separate, all-at-once complete formation that is falsified. Perhaps at some time in the distant future, a super-powerful computer will be able simulate with convincing fidelity the multi-billion-year biological history of the earth, in the same way that scientists today attempt to simulate (in a much more modest scope) the earth's weather and climate.  Then, after thousands of such simulations have been performed, with different starting conditions, we might obtain some meaningful statistics on the chances involved in the origin of life, or in the formation of some class of biological structures such as hemoglobin, or in the rise of intelligent creatures such as ourselves. Until that time, probability calculations such as those that appear in creationist-intelligent design literature should be viewed with great skepticism, to say the least. In a larger context, one has to question whether highly technical issues such as calculations of probabilities have any place in a discussion of religion.  Why attempt to "prove" God with probability, particularly when there are very serious questions as to whether such reasoning is valid?  One is reminded of a passage in the New Testament:  "For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?" [1 Cor. 14:8].  It makes far more sense to leave such matters to peer-reviewed scientific research. See DNA , English text , Information theory , Origin and Deceiver for additional related discussion.

By JOHN ALLEN PAULOS  Sept. 3, 2006   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      A recent international study in the journal Science by Professor Jon Miller of Michigan State University and his associates finds that a growing number of Americans do not believe in the theory of evolution. In fact, the survey of 32 European nations and Japan reveals that only Turkey has a higher percentage of its citizens rejecting Darwin. The author attributes the results in the United States to religious fundamentalism, inadequate science education, and partisan political maneuvering. With regard to the latter Miller notes, "There is no major political party in Europe and Japan that uses opposition to evolution as a part of its political platform." But there's another contributing factor to this opposition to evolution that I'd like to discuss here. It is the concerted attempt by creationists to dress up in the garb of mathematics fundamentalist claims about human origins and to focus criticism on what they take to be the minuscule probability of evolutionary development. (Even the conservative television pundit and ace biologist Ann Coulter has lent her perspicacity to this mathematical endeavor in her recent book.) Creationists argue that the likelihood of, say, a new species of horse developing is absurdly tiny. The same, they say, is true of the development of the eye or the mechanism for blood clotting.  Creationists' Argument  A bit more specifically, the standard argument goes roughly as follows. A very long sequence of individually improbable mutations must occur in order for a species or a biological process to evolve. If we assume these are independent events, then the probability of all of them occurring and occurring in the right order is the product of their respective probabilities, which is always an extremely tiny number. Thus, for example, the probability of getting a 3, 2, 6, 2, and 5 when rolling a single die five times is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 or 1/7,776 -- one chance in 7,776. The much longer sequences of fortuitous events necessary for a new species or a new process to evolve leads to the minuscule numbers that creationists argue prove that evolution is so wildly improbable as to be essentially impossible.   The Flaw  This line of argument, however, is deeply flawed. Leaving aside the issue of independent events, which is too extensive to discuss here, I note that there are always a fantastically huge number of evolutionary paths that might be taken by an organism (or a process) over time. I also note that there is only one that actually will be taken. So if, after the fact, we observe the particular evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole. Misunderstanding this tiny probability, they reject outright the evolutionary process. Here's another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are almost 10 to the 68th power -- a one with 68 zeroes after it -- orderings of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a humongous number, but it's not hard to devise even everyday situations that give rise to much larger numbers. Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule. Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a priori probability is so very tiny. Some ordering had to result from the shuffling, and this one did. Nor, of course, would we be justified in concluding that the whole process of moving from one ordering to another via shuffles is so wildly improbable as to be practically impossible. The actual result of the shufflings will always have a minuscule probability of occurring, but, unless you're a creationist, that doesn't mean the process of obtaining the result is at all dubious.  The Science study is disturbing for many reasons, not the least of which is that there's no telling to what length the creationist trunk of the G.O.P. elephant will evolve.

It is a human tendency to search for meaning, and what could be more meaningful than the belief that our lives have a greater purpose, that all life in fact is guided by a supreme intelligence which manifests itself even at the level of individual molecules?  Proponents of intelligent design believe that the components of life are so complex that they could not possibly have been produced by an evolutionary process. To bolster their argument, they calculate the odds that a specific protein might assemble by chance in the prebiotic environment. The odds against such a chance assembly are so astronomically immense that a protein required for life to begin could not possibly have assembled by chance on the early Earth.  Therefore, the argument goes, life must have been designed. It is not my purpose to argue against this belief, but the intelligent design argument uses a statistical tool of science -- a probability calculation  -- to make a point, so I will use another tool of science, which is to propose an alternative hypothesis and test it.  In living cells, most catalysts are protein enzymes, composed of amino acids, but in the 1980s another kind of catalyst was discovered. These are RNA molecules composed of nucleotides that are now called ribozymes. Because a ribozyme can act both as a catalyst and as a carrier of genetic information in its nucleotide sequence, it has been proposed that life passed through an RNA World phase that did not require DNA and proteins. For the purposes of today’s column I will go through the probability  calculation that a specific ribozyme might assemble by chance. Assume that the ribozyme is 300 nucleotides long, and that at each position there could be any of four nucleotides present. The chances of that ribozyme assembling are then 4^300,  a number so large that it could not possibly happen by chance even once in 13 billion years, the age of the universe.  But life DID begin! Could we be missing something?  The answer, of course, is yes, we are. The calculation assumes that a single specific ribozyme must be synthesized for life to begin, but that’s not how it works. Instead,  let’s make the plausible assumption that an enormous number of random polymers are synthesized, which are then subject to selection and evolution. This is the alternative hypothesis, and we can test it. Now I will recall a classic experiment by David Bartel and Jack Szostak, published in Science in 1993. Their goal was to see if a completely random system of molecules could undergo selection in such a way that defined species of molecules emerged with specific properties. They began by synthesizing many trillions of different RNA molecules about 300 nucleotides long, but the nucleotides were all random nucleotide sequences. Nucleotides, by the way, are monomers of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, just as amino acids are the monomers, or subunits, of proteins, and making random sequences is easy to do with modern methods of molecular biology.  They reasoned that buried in those trillions were a few catalytic RNA molecules called ribozymes that happened to catalyze a ligation reaction, in which one strand of RNA is linked to a second strand. The RNA strands to be ligated were attached to small beads on a column, then were exposed to the trillions of random sequences simply by flushing them through the column. This process could fish out any RNA molecules that happened to have even a weak ability to catalyze the reaction. They then amplified those molecules and put them back in for a second round, repeating the process for 10 rounds. By the way, this is the same basic logic that breeders use when they select for a property such as coat color in dogs. The results were amazing. After only 4 rounds of selection and amplification they began to see an increase in catalytic activity, and after 10 rounds the rate was 7 million times faster than the uncatalyzed rate. It was even possible to watch the RNA evolve. Nucleic acids can be separated and visualized by a technique called gel electrophoresis. The mixture is put in at the top of a gel held between two glass plates and a voltage is applied. Small molecules travel fastest through the gel, and larger molecules move more slowly, so they are separated. In this case, RNA molecules having a specific length produce a visible band in a gel. At the start of the reaction, nothing could be seen, because all the molecules are different. But with each cycle new bands appeared. Some came to dominate the reaction, while others went extinct. Bartel and Szostak’s results have been repeated and extended by other researchers, and they demonstrate a fundamental principle of evolution at the molecular level. At the start of the experiment, every molecule of RNA was different from all the rest because they were assembled by a chance process. There were no species, just a mixture of trillions of different molecules. But then a selective hurdle was imposed, a ligation reaction that allowed only certain molecules to survive and reproduce enzymatically.  In a few generations groups of molecules began to emerge that displayed ever-increasing catalytic function. In other words, species of molecules appeared out of this random mixture in an evolutionary process that closely reflects the natural selection that Darwin outlined for populations of higher animals. These RNA molecules were defined by the sequence of bases in their structures, which caused them to fold into specific conformations that had catalytic properties. The sequences were in essence analogous to genes, because the information they contained was passed between generations during the amplification process. The Bartel and Szostak experiment directly refutes the argument that the odds are stacked against an origin of life by natural processes. The inescapable conclusion is that genetic information can in fact emerge from random mixtures of polymers, as long as the populations contain large numbers of polymeric molecules with variable monomer sequences, and a way to select and amplify a specific property. I will close with a quote from Freeman Dyson, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University who also enjoys thinking about the origin of life: “You  had what I call the garbage bag model. The early cells were just  little bags of some kind of cell membrane, which might have been  oily or it might have been a metal oxide.  And inside you  had a more or less random collection of organic molecules, with the  characteristic that small molecules could diffuse in through the  membrane, but big molecules could not diffuse out. By converting  small molecules into big molecules, you could concentrate the organic  contents on the inside, so the cells would become more concentrated  and the chemistry would gradually become more efficient. So these  things could evolve without any kind of replication.  It's a  simple statistical inheritance.  When a cell became so big that  it got cut in half, or shaken in half, by some rainstorm or environmental  disturbance, it would then produce two cells which would be its daughters,  which would inherit, more or less, but only statistically, the chemical  machinery inside.  Evolution could work under those conditions.”     Stars, Planets, Life    More Articles  What's It Like For a Working Scientist To Write a Novel?

One of the breakout sessions featured a fellow from the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) presenting a lecture about probability and evolution.  His talk was mostly just a watered-down version of William Dembski’s standard talking points.  His triumphant conclusion was that the probability of something or other having evolved by natural processes was one over something enormous, from which he concluded that evolution had been refuted.  There were only about fifteen of us in the room.  During the subsequent question period, one older gentleman said something very close to this: “When scientists are confronted with a probability that small…”  He paused here, as though struggling to accept just how small a number it was.  “What else can they do but just stare at it helplessly?”  I was the next to speak.  I said, “I think I can tell you how they would react to that calculation.  They would question the legitimacy of the assumptions that went into it.”  I then rattled off three implausible assumptions underlying the calculation.  The other fellow just stared at me.  The speaker, incredibly, replied that this was just a popular level presentation, and then rattled off several additional points of disanalogy between his calculation and reality.  He seemed to think that was a good answer.  I replied that the problem wasn’t simply that certain details had been left out of the calculation to keep it manageable.  It was that the variables that were missing could not be quantified with any accuracy.  Consequently, absolutely nothing like what he was doing could be made to work.  He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  Creationists love probability.  If you are a speaker trying to bamboozle a lay audience, there is no better way than to drop in a back-of-the-envelope calculation.  The trouble is that the things they are trying to quantify are inherently unquantifiable.  There is no way to calculate the probability of an eye, for example, evolving over the course of millions of years of evolution by natural selection.  The young-Earthers typically try to circumvent this point by ignoring the role of selection.  They typically toss off combinatorial arguments in which the probability of evolving some complex molecule, like hemoglobin, is taken to be one over the number of ways of arranging the amino acids in that molecule.  Sadly, that only works if all of those arrangements are equiprobable, but the continuing action of natural selection ensures that they are not.  The ID folks try to gum up the works with blather about specificity or universal probability bounds.  But when it comes time to perform specific probability calculations (something they almost never do) they inevitably invoke “irreducible complexity” as an excuse for ignoring the role of natural selection.  That is not a reasonable thing to do, to put it kindly.  I was thinking about this while reading this post over at Uncommon Descent.  Jonathan M. writes:  A couple months ago, I took an online “moodle” class with the Center for Inquiry on the topic of the evolution debate. The instructor was the renowned philosopher and evolutionary biologist, Massimo Pigliucci. I entered into an exchange of dialogue with Pigliucci and the other students on the evidence for the efficacy of naturalistic evolution, as well as presenting some counter-arguments against it and for ID.  During the course of our discussion, Pigliucci made some claims which astonished me — especially as arguments coming from a trained philosopher and world-renowned evolutionary theorist. To my surprise, when I articulated the numerous probabilistic hurdles — hurdles which are so pervasive at every level — which Darwinism has to overcome in order to be considered a viable paradigm, he wrote,  No evolutionary biologist I know…actually attaches probabilities to specific evolutionary events of the type you are talking about. There is no way to do that. Similarly, there is no way to attach probabilities to the set of physical laws regulating our universe, for the simple reason that we have no sample population to draw from (which is why typically you estimate probabilities).   Let’s pause here.  One suspects that the key phrase in Pigliucici’s statement is, “of the sort you are talking about.”  Assuming that Jonathan M.’s vague reference to the probabilistic hurdles facing evolution involves the sorts of things ID folks usually say, then Pigliucci’s statement is exactly right.  When an ID proponent starts applying probability language to questions regarding the fine-tuning of the universe or to specific biological structures, it’s a pretty safe bet they are talking through their hats.  But Jonathan M. demurs.  He continues:  This struck me at the time as a very strange argument to be making given the fact that many Darwinists (Dawkins & Futuyma spring to mind) say that the brilliance of Darwin was to reduce the improbability of getting complex, design-like systems. What was the whole point of “Climbing Mount Improbable”? The point was that probability didn’t have to jump up the sheer face of the cliff. It could meander up the gently sloping rear side, in small probability increments. But if we can’t assign probabilities to the events, exactly what has Darwin’s theory done?  The image of probability jumping up the sheer face of a cliff is amusing, but otherwise I fail to understand how any of this relates to what Pigliucci said.  After all, he certainly did not say that you must never, ever use probability language in the context of evolution.  In context, it is perfectly clear what Dawkins and Futuyma have in mind.  If we naively think of every possible genotype having the same probability as every other possible genotype, and then imagine evolution proceeding by selecting genotypes entirely at random, then the probability is vanishingly small that we shall ever find one that produces a functional, complex organism.  But when we factor natural selection into the process it becomes clear that we should not be treating all possible genotypes as equiprobable.  Instead, most of those genotypes have a probability close to zero of ever occurring, because they will be weeded out by selection.  The handful of functional genotypes will be favored by selection.  In this way it is meaningful to say that natural selection changes the probabilities of evolving various structures.  Notice, though, that neither Dawkins nor Futuyma tried to calculate a precise number representing the probability of evolving some particular complex system.  That’s precisely the sort of calculation Pigliucci was describing as impossible.  Jonathan M. now writes:  In response to Massimo, I cited several attempts by Darwinists — many of which feature in the peer-reviewed literature — which attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of the Darwinian mechanism by virtue of probabilistic arguments. I wrote…  He now unloads a long list of examples in which evolutionists employ probabilistic arguments.  Follow the link to the post for the details. He concludes his list with:  But this should be sufficient to refute your [Pigliucci’s] claim that evolutionary biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility.  He now protests that he never got a reply from Pigliucci.  I’m not surprised, since Jonathan M. is completely confused about what the issue is.  Pigliucci certainly never claimed that biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility (whatever that even means).  He said simply that evolutionary biologists do not assign probabilities to specific events in the way that ID folks would like.  For example, Jonathan M. points to a calculation in which biologist Sean Carroll estimated the probability of obtaining the same mutation four times independently in different orders of birds.  In such a narrowly defined situation the problem has more to do with combinatorics than probability, and we can be confident that all of the relevant variables can be approximated with reasonable accuracy.  He also points to a paper by Durrett and Schmidt , in which they evaluated the probability of obtaining two particular mutations in at least one individual of a population.  Once again, in such a narrowly defined situation it is possible to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  But notice that neither they, nor Carroll, were trying to calculate the probability of evolving a flagellum or anything remotely like that.  In the remaining examples the authors don’t explicitly calculate the probability of anything.  Jonathan M. mentions Dawkins’ “weasel” experiment , presented in his book The Blind Watchmaker. But Dawkins was merely illustrating the power of cumulative selection versus random selection.  He was not calculating probabilities. This paper by Wilf and Ewens , also mentioned in the post, puts some mathematical meat on the bones of Dawkins’ suggestion.  They are working with probabilities only indirectly, and certainly were not trying to assign precise numerical values to specific evolutionary events.  The final reference is to the Avida simulation , but this too had nothing to do with working out the probabilities of specific evolutionary events.  The basic point here is very simple.  A proper probability calculation begins with the definition of a probability space, which means roughly that you must have a grasp on all of the things that might happen and also on the probabilities with which those events occur.  There are many contexts in evolutionary biology where that can be done.  In population genetics, for example, we typically narrow our focus to small numbers of loci over short periods of time, which permits us to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  This is far different from trying to work out precise probabilities for specific structures that evolved over vast stretches of time.  In such situations we have no hope of getting a grip on everything.  But ID folks forge ahead regardless.  More precisely, since they almost never carry out actual calculations, they simply claim that such things can be done and that when they are the result is bad news for evolution.  Pointing out that this sort of thing is not feasible even in principle, as PIgliucci quite sensibly did, hardly implies that probability does not have useful roles to play in evolutionary theory.

It is such a naked display of ignorance.          #2  Kel   August 16, 2011    Oh good, it’s not just me who finds such arguments as grossly misrepresenting the process. I remember being asked to calculate the probability of some existing gene, as if I had a complete evolutionary history by which to crunch the numbers. Geting so sick of seeing the sharpshooter fallacy expressed as ‘proof’ a designer must have done it.          #3  Massimo Pigliucci   August 16, 2011    Yup, you got it exactly right!          #4  wbk   August 16, 2011    If you calculated the probability of the particular arrangement of grains of sand on the beach at a snapshot in time it would be wildly improbable, and yet there it is (and you get a new wildly improbable arrangement after each wave recedes). Mis-interpreting this kind of small probability is very common. We’re encouraged to interpret small probabilities as evidence that an event is unlikely to occur in some contexts, such as the small probability of a chance match in a DNA test in a criminal case. It’s not so straightforward to recognize the difference between how probability is used in a criminal case and how it’s used here. The key, I think, is that small probabilities are really only meaningful when they’re compared with other alternative outcomes (e.g. the probability of a chance match in a criminal case, vs. the probability of a match if the sample came from the accused).          #5  Mike Gage   August 17, 2011    Has anyone else ever tried to comment at Uncommon Descent? I made some very tame comments just pointing out some simple errors in reasoning and they were never posted. Apparently that is their M.O. They censor all other opinions (except for a few very mild cases so they can deny it) and just have a safe community free of well-argued dissent.          #6  Owlmirror   August 17, 2011    Monsieur Rosenhouse, $$ \frac{(a+b^n)}{n} = x $$, therefore, God exists!  Reply!          #7  James Thompson   August 17, 2011    Do you think that the arguments would be more accessible and clear if they focused on relative probability (or likelihood ratios?) rather than absolute probability? Evolution is complex, and there are many factors that are difficult to estimate. However, if one is clever about the way that comparisons are made, many of those factors will cancel out.          #8  Koray   August 17, 2011    No surprise there, Jason. You wrote a book on how people fail to grok probability theory after all.          #9  craig schwartz   August 17, 2011    Given the typical human ejaculate contains some hundred of millions of sperm, and give the number of chance meetings and couplings of JonathanMs’ parents, and grandparents, and along the whole chain of his ancestry, the probability of JonathanM existing at all is vanishingly small. Therefore, he doesn’t (exist).          #10  Bob O'H   August 17, 2011    I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.          #11  Richard Wein   August 17, 2011    To calculate a probability (or any other quantity relating to a real process) we need to be able to abstract the real, complex process down to a relatively simple model which roughly preserves the quantity that we’re interested in. This isn’t always possible.  Nilsson and Pelger did it (arguably) for the evolution of an eye, by abstracting the eye down to its most significant elements, and using a crude general model for estimating the time needed for each small change. (They estimated an expected time rather than a probability, but the two are closely related.) But note that they were showing the existence of an evolutionary scenario that rendered the evolution of that trait probable. It would be much harder to show the non-existence of any such scenario, which is what the creationist is trying to do.          #12  JimR   August 17, 2011    Given that evolution consists of small incremental changes, then trying to apply probability as if each event is independent gives you the (1/quazillion)^wayupthere kind of calculations. This model is completely wrong. Bayes theorem is the only accurate model basis where each step is preconditioned on the prior one. With simultaneous combinations in the 10^? occurring and infeasible ones dropping out, the calculation at each step is 10^?/quazillion), a much lower, but still unknown probability. Also there is not just one selection, but multiple surviving, all of which may be equally feasible. AND most likely there are many replicates of each of the multiple lines. Catastrophic events may weed some of these lines. The many lines and many reps is especially true in the evolutionary changes in unicellular organisms. It becomes somewhat narrower as the complexity of the organism advances. So the timeline for advantageous changes in the unicellular evolution is short compared to the timeline for more complex lines. Yet the time existed. I’m sorry for folks that cannot imagine these vast populations changing over time. There is no end goal except survival at each step. Natural Selection is a scary, but fascinating process. I’m glad I made it to see the advances made up to now. I wonder where life forms will be 10^n years from now.          #13  TomS   August 17, 2011    I like to calculate, using the same methodology, the probability that an intelligent designer would design things the way they are.  An intelligent designer, presumably, can do more things than can be done by “naturalistic processes”.  The probability that something happens is the number of favorable cases divided by the number of possible cases. Intelligent design means that the denominator, the number of possible cases, is greater than the number of possible cases with naturalistic processes.  This means that, no matter how small the probability is that naturalistic processes would result in such-and-such, the probability is smaller that an intelligent designer would do it.  Things would change, to be sure, if someone would specify what sorts of things intelligent designers would not, or could not, do.          #14  Dunc   August 17, 2011    To take a slightly different tack, there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable once you’re dealing with a beaker the size of a planet over timescales of hundreds of millions of years… Sure, the question is fundamentally “not even wrong”, but even granting these absurd premises for the sake of argument, I’m still not convinced.          #15  NJ   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H @ 10:  I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  That whooshing sound you heard was the point of his post going right by you.          #16  Tommy Holland   August 17, 2011    Reminds me of the absurd probability calculations that evangelists make to demonstrate how unlikely it would be for a man named Jesus to fulfill an Old Testament prophecy, let alone “hundreds” of them.  They’re careful to list the absurdly large numbers, but never show how those numbers were calculated.          #17  Lenoxus   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H:  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  That’s an… oddly constrained description. Is “the Lord” the name of one of your pets, unable to literally say “that pleases me” but able to wag its tail or rub its face against you?  Or perhaps you are being extremely euphemistic, and “the Lord” is your nickname for a lover? Nothing wrong with that, of course. It’s just that I can’t help but see “if you get my drift” after “he acts in a way I interpret to mean he likes it”.  If “the Lord” is God, I wonder why his tastes have changed. Didn’t the smell of burning ox flesh used to please his nostrils? But now he’s all about the music. An improvent, I suppose.          #18  TomS   August 17, 2011    @craig schwartz #9:  I like that version of the probability argument, too.  The way I prefer to calculate it is:  First of all, excluding intermarriage, a person has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, and 8 grandparents, so let’s assume distinct 10 ancestors per generation in the 19th century and earlier; and three generations per century. That means 30 ancestors per century. If we go back 1000 years, that means about 300 ancestors.  And in those days, a lot of children died before reaching maturity, something like 50%. (We can reduce that number significantly by considering the probability that ancestor X and ancestor Y met and became the parents of your ancestor Z.)  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.          #19  dean   August 17, 2011    “the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) ”  It’s not a think tank: it’s a dogma tank.          #20  eric   August 17, 2011    there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable  Right.  As several posters have pointed out, highly improbable things happen all the time.  In fact, in any circumstance where a large number of different things could happen, there is a near-100% chance that something highly improbable will happen. 🙂  Have a creo tell you what limit makes some event too improbable to happen (i.e., 1 in 10^X).  Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 1.3*X (rounding up), and you’ll create an event that is less probable than their limit.          #21  Raging Bee   August 17, 2011    IF you want to disprove evolution using probability, you have to demonstrate that the creation of all life on Earth as we see it by a “Designer” is MORE probable than the creation of such life through evolution.  So how would we do that?  First, of course, we have to make some assumptions about the Designer: who/what is he/she/it/they?  And since the overwhelming majority of creationists clearly assume it’s the God of the Bible, we’ll go with that assumption: Go — excuse me, The Designer — is a supernatural being of literally infinite power and knowledge.  Next step: what is the range of possible universes this esigner can create?  Answer: an INFINITE range — an all-powerful Go — Designer — can create anything he’s capable of imagining, which, for a being of infinite intelligence, is an infinite range.  So what’s the probability of the Designer creating this particular Universe, with this particular set of life-forms, out of the literally infinite range of possibile universes he could have created?  Why, that would be one in infinity — which is to say zero.  Not “essentially zero,” mind you, not “vanishingly small,” not “close” to zero, but really, truly, exactly, LITERALLY zero point zero zero zip zilch nada buggerall fuggedaboutit.  Creationists, please reply.          #22  Dr. I. Needtob Athe   August 17, 2011    When someone argues that evolution is too improbable to be true, one might respond in this fashion:  “Think about the improbability that you were born. It required that your two parents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did (else your brother or sister would have been born instead), and that, in turn, required that your four grandparents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did so that your parents existed in the first place, which required that your eight great-grandparents all met and mated at the exact time that they did, and so on, all the way back to the beginning of mankind. Therefore, using your logic, I just proved that you don’t exist.”          #23  Vicki   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H: I trust there’s enough fish to keep the Lord happy. (Lenoxus: It’s a literary allusion.)  This is the point at which I want to tell the anti-evolutionists that the probability of humans having evolved is 1, because it has happened in every known universe. I don’t believe this, or rather I don’t think it’s meaningful, but I also think it’s sounder than their numbers, because it’s based on observed facts, namely, we exist.          #24  TomS   August 17, 2011    @Raging Bee #21:  I agree fully with you. I was being a little more conservative, but I agree that the probability that an omnipotent being would create such-and-such is zero .  But I would note that mathematicians do not equate “probability zero” to “impossible”. For example, a real number is rational with probability zero.  BTW, I made a mistake in the final calculations of my post #18. It should read:  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^90 = 1 / 10^90.          #25  Jeff Sherry   August 17, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?          #26  Ken sinisi   August 17, 2011    Doesn’t the seemingly endless debate of evolution vs. creationism, when broken down to it’s simplest form, become a debate of the logical vs. the illogical? Why would one continually try to explain and reason with another who insists that a wheel is square, and not round? Prove to me that the wheel is round. I say it’s square. A lesson in futility.          #27  stevev   August 17, 2011    So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.  But all of your ancestors DID survive to maturity (or you wouldn’t be here) so the probability is 1.          #28  Kel   August 17, 2011    Plantinga’s EAAN is a perfect example of armchair philosophy, where really such an approach shows moore the limitation of the philosopher than of the process itself. Fodor’s a priori argument against natural selection another. It’s interesting reading about experiment after experiment that illustrates natural selection so well, only to find talking about counterfactuals that rule out ‘selection for’. In defence of philosophers, many rushed to point out precisely where Fodor was mistaken, just as many have argued against Plantinga. But what good does either argument do for the practice of biology? Does either argument make predictions about the phenomena observed? Are they empirically falsifiable? If not, what good are they?          #29  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.  Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #30  Kel   August 17, 2011    Whoops, that last comment was meant to go in a different thread. My mistake.          #31  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.  Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #32  Jud   August 17, 2011    One typical creationist error is to consider the actual outcome as the only “right” outcome, and treat one over number-of-possible-outcomes as the relevant probability.  This is what’s behind the argument that the probability you exist is infinitesimal, or the grains-of-sand example in #4.  Sean B. Carroll pointed out in one of his books that if the creationist view were correct, no one would win the (Powerball) lottery for a couple million years – the odds of a particular player winning are about 200 million to 1, and there are two drawings per week, so about 100 per year.  But someone wins the lottery every couple of weeks, so that’s obviously not the correct calculation.  The correct calculation is the one that gives the odds of *anyone* winning the lottery, just as the correct evolutionary calculation is not the odds of one specific mutation, but of *any* mutation occurring that allows the organism to survive and reproduce.  (Those odds are then of course modified by selection in some cases, and go to fixation through genetic drift in other cases.)          #33  Matt G   August 17, 2011    I came up with an analogy.  Imagine playing bridge and having all four players dealt all the cards in a suit.  The probability of being dealt those hands is minuscule, yet the probability of being dealt ANY given set of hands is just as minuscule.          #34  Face   August 18, 2011    denemek lazım kanka denemekden zarar gelmez          #35  Face   August 18, 2011    reis diyosa haklıdır          #36  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, the problem with that analogy is that the creationists will agree that each hand is equally improbable – but that you’ve gotten a royal flush. While any hand is equally improbable, the quality of the hand varies in probability.  That said, they leave the most crucial element out – selection. If you return individual cards and keep good ones, gradually you’ll get a better and better hand. Yes, a royal flush is really improbable, but you’re going to get one so much quicker by gradually mutating a hand than you are doing it from scratch. By assigning those a priori improbabilities, they misrepresent the process, and thus the numbers are useless.          #37  Remo   August 18, 2011    If the universe is infinite (which it may well be) then regardless of its improbability, life will have arisen in an infinite number of locations.  QED          #38  Owlmirror   August 18, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?  Actually, it is almost certainly apocryphal .  But I am sure that Jason knows of the anecdote, and, I hope, finds the reference appropriately amusing.          #39  TomS   August 18, 2011    As far as the “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism”, I like to transpose all of the arguments by the evolution-deniers into arguments where “evolution” is replaced by “reproduction”. It’s fascinating just how many of the arguments for creationism/intelligent design turn out to be at least as good (if not better!) arguments for Scientific Storkism.  For example, let us suppose that our brains are the product of naturalistic processes of reproduction and development. How, then, can we trust out thoughts?  BTW, let us suppose that our thoughts are, rather, just implanted in our brains by some “intelligent designer”. Does that make them any more reliable? After all, this is the same “intelligent designer” who designed the universe with the false appearance of life being related by billions of years of common descent. Would you trust a used-car salesman who told you that the used car only had the appearance of being 20 years old with 500,000 miles on it – it’s “really” last year’s model? (And the used-car salesman is only off by a factor of 10 or 100 – not a factor of a million or so, like “young earth creationism”.)          #40  anthrosciguy   August 18, 2011    One problem pseudoscientists face is that they shortcut from speculation to the end.  While it’s possible that a biologist thinking about evolution (it would have to be sometime back when we didn’t have anywhere near as much info as we do now) might make a probalistic back of the envelope calculation to see if a completely random process — random from start to finish — could account for what we see in nature.  They’d see that it doesn’t, and the reaction would be that they needed to do more thinking about what could account for this.  And they did that and we’ve got a very sound idea of how this happens.  The pseudoscientist typically takes the first speculation and that’s it: they treat it as the finished product and it becomes, in their minds, data.  You see this sort of short circuiting from speculation to “data” over and over in virtually all types of pseudoscience and pseudohistory.          #41  Matt G   August 18, 2011    Kel-  I use that bridge analogy to counter the “evolution is like a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling a 747” argument.  Any number of organisms COULD have evolved, but a tiny subset actually did.  You extension of my analogy is a lot like Dawkin’s “Methinks it is like a weasel” analogy which illustrates how cycles of (random) mutation and (non-random) selection can generate something non-random.          #42  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, indeed. It’s a really good analogy, so much so that creationists still try their damn hardest to miss the point and take the analogy for what it wasn’t. Though it’s even more amazing that creationists so fundamentally misunderstand how evolution works that any talk of probability that they’re going to take any explanation of improbability as being monkeys on typewriters producing Shakespeare.          #43  Pragmatist   August 18, 2011    All of these type of Creationist arguments really are variations on this question: “It works in practice, but can they prove it works in theory?” The absurdity of that is all that is needed to rebut them.          #44  shekhar   August 19, 2011    It is very wonderfull center          #45  John K.   August 19, 2011    Probability is just a way to manage the unknown.  The big problem in  the probability argument here is taking known factors and treating them as if they were unknown.  A set of parents have 3 daughters.  What are the chances the next child they have will be female?  1 in 2 of course.  Why not 1 in 16?  Because the first 3 children have KNOWN genders.  Lottery numbers are difficult to pick because of the many unknown factors.  If the trajectories of all the balls are accurately traced (a difficult task to be sure) the correct numbers could be picked every time.  When something happens that is “highly improbable” to you, it is more a reflection how much of the process was unknown to you.  For creationists that deliberately refuse to consider evidence, it is natural that they think the probability is very low.  Their understanding is abysmally poor.          #46  Lenoxus   August 20, 2011    Regarding the EAN: on top of everything else, it seems that the EAN requires a premise like “It is true that our minds are rational and our thinking process can be trusted to be accurate.” For a premise in a logical argument, sn’t that extremely problematic? How do we know that our minds aren’t faulty?  In fact, it’s worse than that, because we know, from thousands of experiments, the precise ways our minds get fooled; we call them “cognitive biases”. So we actually have positive evidence that if our minds are the product of an omnipotent designer, she wanted them to be irrational.          #47  rob   August 23, 2011    @Remo:  “It is known that there are an infinte number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely products of a deranged imagination.”          #48  Jeff   August 28, 2011    He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  This is what they do. A couple of years ago, I attended a talk given by a YEC who had just bamboozled Harvard into giving him a PhD in Cell Biology. It was sponsored by an evangelical church, but there were a number of scientists and science-oriented people in attendance, including a real microbiologist, and they hammered away at him during the Q&A. Each time he was backed into a corner, made to admit he didn’t understand or was ignorant of the science, he just dropped the issue in question and moved on.  For these people, it has absolutely nothing to do with apprehending objective reality. It’s entirely about getting the ontological security blanket for the few brief decades they’re here – and for many (I contend it’s most), fantasizing about our eternal torment being their half-time entertainment in the afterlife.          #49  Tomato Addict   September 8, 2011    @#7: Michael Behe’s “Complex Specified Information” is a likelihood ratio (sort of), but it fails for the same reason that Jason wrote about. CSI calculates the likelihood of jumping up the cliff, a “big jump” null hypothesis, and claims it is impossible. The possibility of gradual selection, or going up the gradual slope, is not considered, nor it is acknowledged that it isn’t possible to calculate such a number.          #50  Paul   November 2, 2011    Fantastic post I very much enjoyed it, keep up the good work.          #51  Emil Sugak   November 30, 2011    Throughout history man has taken very good records of big events thats a fact. So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded. I mean man has been around thousands of years and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another or one evolving to man. Even if something as far fetched as that happened it would have made headline news, thats also a fact. So if we supposedly evolved from monkeys or apes why then are they still here and why are they not evolving now,Even if they were scientists would be recording it and that would also make headline news, also a fact.So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly,Even you should be able to laugh yourself silly on that one. For everything that happens there is proof,another fact and you know that also. Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true. All that happens all around the world is everything all living things great and small adapt to the environment they are living in. When all evolution theories are proven wrong so far I cannot wait to hear what the next assumption will be, Should be a good one.          #52  Wow   November 30, 2011    > So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded.  It is.  The evolution of viral resistance is a record of evolution, for example.  > and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another  See above.  > or one evolving to man  It isn’t magic. No “Size of an Elephant!” fwoosh.  You’re still beholden to the childish wish fulfilment.  Have a look at the foetus development. There’s a tadpole. There’s a lizard. Then there’s a baby. Then there’s a child. Then there’s an adult.  Those changes are so much part of every day, that transformation from tadpole to human doesn’t make the news because it is so commonplace.  > So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly  You’re proof that devolution happens rapidly.  I guess you just invest whatever nonsense you believe is nonsense and paste it over what you’re told about science so you don’t have to think. How rapid is “rapid” in this case?  > Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true  Bottom line: what is going on, then?          #53  Eric   March 15, 2012    The probability argument is just one. Evolutionists also have to bear the burden of explaining how naturalistic processes somehow broke some very basic laws of nature in order for life to be created, i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics. I find it funny that a group that is so set on evidence being the only criteria for rational belief in something would be quite content with, “We don’t know.”, regarding the theory of evolution.          #54  Wow   March 15, 2012    “i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics”  Nope, biogenesis doesn’t disobey the laws of thermodynamics.  They turn high-energy, low-entropy sunlight at a spectrum of 6000K and turn it into low-energy, high-entropy thermal energy at a spectrum of ~300K.  Nothing broken there.  I find it funny when people find it funny when they promote their ignorance of science onto others and think it proves these others are wrong.       New comments have been disabled.

Quote of the day (refresh browser to select another):  The basic difference	between playing a human and playing a supermatch against Deep Blue is the eerie and	almost empty sensation of not having a human sitting opposite you.  With humans, you automatically know a lot about their nationality, gender, mannerisms, and such minor things as a persistent cough or bad breath.  Years ago we had to endure chain-smokers who blew smoke our way.

Question Asked 4 years ago Jeus Jardin  2.55 Universidad de Navarra Is it mathematically possible for evolution to take place given the Earth's age of 4.54 billion years? Is there a mathematical probability explaining the mutation of an amino acid or a single protein polypeptide chain or whatever is the primordial component, to organize itself so as to give the biological and genetic foundation for the diversity of life we have today, given and in consideration of the age of the earth which is about 4.54 billion years old?

Slightly less short: If it wasn't (but see above, it is), a more parsimonious answer than all others would be that the maths was wrong (but it's not). Richard Lenski's work is definitely well worth reading. He and his group have shown lots of evolution within the timescale of a PhD project. Repeatedly. 22 Recommendations 4 years ago J. Patrick Kelley University of Wyoming Remember that evolutionary change is not limited to mutations, but also is influenced by selection and genetic drift. Selective agents (e.g. predation, climate, etc.) can lead to rapid evolution. I know everyone here knows this, but it seems to have been omitted from the question and the answers. Perhaps the original question was meant to ask if modern diversity could have arisen by mutation alone in 4.3-4.4 billion years (based on the recent evidence in Nature Geoscience showing that life could have existed 4.3-4.4 billion years ago). 15 Recommendations All Answers ( 90 ) 4 years ago André F. D'Almeida New University of Lisbon Well, I believe there is no mutation per se in either amino-acids or the protein polypeptide chain, but in the codons (and probably duons) that carry the code for creating them (mRNA). I would however point out to this paper where they provide a very good argument for the question you are posing. Albeit not being an expert in the matter, I do agree with their conclusions. http://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22454.short Alternatively, you can look at papers on mathematical models for complex systems and self-organization. Have a look here for an introduction: http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/SELFORG.html 4 years ago Deleted profile Added an answer Dear Jeus Jardin, One thing old Pascal was very clear on was to avoid the phrase 'probability'. He consistently used 'chance' or something equivalent in french. In genetics this seems important, you do not have a 1 in [some big number] probability something will happen. Things happen by chance and only afterward we can re-analyse the whole process more-or-less and come up with this 1 in [big number]. If you were very mechanically inclined you could look at DNA, look at what processes can change it, look at how such a change might be viable, ... Would the outcome, a very tiny number, be of any importance ? I am afraid that your question cannot be answered in the sense you use (has there been time enough ?). We have only one example of a primordial mess eventually producing us in some four billion years. I would hesitate to put a number on that chance.

Papageorgiou Democritus University of Thrace Since mutation is the only primary source of diversity - which then is influenced by selection, migration, drift, mating - you probably ask if 5.54 billion years are enough for mutations to produce all the existing alleles of all genes plus the ones that are lost on the way. With a roughly estimated mutation rate of 1/10^-4 to 1/10^-6 per gene per generation and the fact that each individual of each species has thousands of genes, then I suppose that time was more than enough to produce the basis of allelic richness that exists today in nature. Also think that life on earth is much younger than the geological life of our planet, probably the half. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Johannes Enroth University of Helsinki I wish to ignore all creationist crap here. Mathematical probability is completely irrelevant, as the outcome is what it is, what we are. We know a lot about molecules but we cannot know the exact circumstances in which the first chemical and then biological evolution took place. I think in lottery (here in Finland) the probability that the "right" combination of seven numbers comes out is about one in 15 million, and yet every week some combination does come out, although it had exactly the same probability as any other combination of seven numbers. It is absurd to ask "how probable is it that we are here?" 5 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter Keller I do think it is an important and relevant question, even if the answer can only be philosphical until we discover life somewhere else. Until then, it is a "sample size of one" problem with all statistical implications. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Mark van Hoeij Florida State University Nobody knows if the chance of life getting started on a favorable planet is tiny or high. That is one of the main reasons why people want to build very large telescopes to view extra-solar planets (it would be interesting to know if one can find extra-solar planets with oxygen, because O2 is an indicator of life). As for what happened after life got started, there is lots of data about that here on Earth, so detailed answers are possible. The probabilities, expected amount of time for changes to occur, etc, these are known, tested, compared in multiple ways (e.g. fossils vs DNA), etc. I attended a creationist talk, and the most convincing argument he made was that favorable mutations are unlikely to accumulate "quickly" (even on geologic time scales). After analyzing the argument, I realized that it only applies to asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is a method in which favorable mutations can accumulate fairly quickly (on geologic time scales). The end result of the argument is that we should expect evolution to be slow in asexual reproduction, but much faster in sexual reproduction  (note: you might think that bacteria should then evolve very slowly because they reproduce asexually, but this is not quite the case because bacteria do in fact exchange genetic information, and at the end of the day, all that the creationist argument really proved is that evolution will be slow if there is really no exchange of genetic information taking place, but that's not how biology operates in the real world). Species are not cleanly separated. A big chunk of your DNA comes from virusses having inserted their genetic information into one of your ancestors. Comparing your DNA with other species, particularly the parts of your DNA with clear viral origin, gives extremely strong evidence of common origins. If you want to calculate probabilities, consider this:   If chimpanzees and humans do not share common ancestors, then what is the probability that these two species have hundreds of positions in their DNA where viral DNA was inserted at exactly the same position? (the type of virus matches each time as well) 5 Recommendations 4 years ago Kurt Bernardo Wolf Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México I think it is a relevant question that might be answered to some debree by biophisicists who have determined mean mutation rates in DNA, be it out of theoretical considerations or experimental (i.e. archaeological) statistics. The assumptions that the process be linear, punctuated or episodic are of course relevant. Good topic for a PhD thesis. The religious viewpoint is beside the point. 4 years ago Peter D Roopnarine California Academy of Sciences You know, scientists actually do work on this problem. It is not a philosophical question, since life obviously has originated at least once, and the best of our evidence suggests that life did indeed originate here on Earth. The question of whether there is work toward the questions of probability and elapsed time can be answered as "Yes". Some accessible work on this topic, though not the most current, would be Eigen and Schuster's "Hypercycle" and Stuart Kauffman's "Investigations". No comment on the creationist nonsense. Oh, and someone above mentioned Maynard Smith: Maynard Smith and Szathmary's "Major Transitions in Evolution" is also very accessible. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago Mike S Fowler Swansea University Short answer: yes.

Repeatedly. 22 Recommendations 4 years ago James D Westmancoat Queen Mary, University of London Yes - Estimates of evolutionary change are based on a conservative rate of mutational occurrence. It is not therefore out of reasonable speculation to have achieved this within 4.54 billion years. It is however impossible to have achieved this within 6000 years. So for those trying to use this to put creationism into science just remember that Charles Darwin, the devout Christian that he was, himself tried, failed and concluded that evolution was the only way for this level of diversity to have arisen. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester As #Peter Keller  said, we have a sample size of 1. But we also have a probability of 1. I think, therefore I am. And if we are, then it did happen. Apologies for the obvious circular reasoning, but it is kind of inescapable, as we are here and we did evolve within that time scale. Or is anyone seriously considering the idea that we were seeded by astronauts? 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter Keller The problem is, we are part of the sample size of one. That life came into existence on earth is clear and has probability one (because we are living proof that it happened), indeed. But it is a conditional probability. There is no hope to calculate the probability of life in general, as long as we don't find other "samples", as we, in some sense, don't have access to the whole sample space. We can only speculate how it happened and there are good people out there who try exactly that. Luckily however, there is not the slightest indication that we were created by a divinity or star travelling species, neither is there any necessity for it. 4 years ago Kurt Bernardo Wolf Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México It would be useful if the authors or citators of articles on evolution rate would give the exact bibliographical reference, so we can decide on the question on the basis of their analyses.  Philosophy doesn't help to resolve the question: can the diversity of life at present be explained by random mutations + survival rate + global extinction events + everything else?  Is it the invisible hand of God or is it that of the free market? 4 years ago Marco Marzola New University of Lisbon The only true answer is: 'Yes, it is. On this planet, under the conditons that ruled on this planet since its formation, 4.54 billion years are mathematically sufficient'. If then you ask why, well... there is no other answer than life on this planet is the only evidence of that time gap to be enough. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Jean-Sébastien Pierre Université de Rennes 1 Actual science proves it did. As soon as you have true cells, even procaryotic, with nucleic acid and protein synthesis machinery, the time elapsed is fully compatible with complex evolution. The question of prebiotic evolution is much more tricky as we know very few about it. Even LUCA can only be reconstructed under the hypothesis that it is an organism based on a nucleic acid, likely a RNA but what about before ? 4 years ago Mark McMenamin Mount Holyoke College Your question seems to assume steady, gradual microevolutionary change over billions of years. The paleontological evidence indicates that the evolutionary process is episodic in the extreme. We do not yet have a reasonable explanation of the mechanisms that drive macroevolutionary change, most of which seems to have been very rapid (see my review "Breakthrough on the Cambrian Explosion"). So, the question of whether 4.5 billion years is enough time to account for observed evolutionary divergence is beside the point, because evolution does not seem to have occurred in a gradual-Neodarwinian fashion. Poorly understood and apparently fast evolutionary transitions have occurred between the major groups. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago William Mayor In attempting to answer a question like this, one should consider their assumptions.  For a die hard new earth creationist there is clearly not enough time.  For someone committed to only evolution being the factor, there clearly had to be enough time.  If one falls somewhere in between these positions, possibly some variation of directed evolution, the question might be answered either way.  I will stand with there being enough time though, thus ruling myself as not being a die hard young earth creationist, but not revealing much beyond that. 4 years ago Deleted profile Added an answer Yes of course it is mathematically possible that evolution happened over that time period. Our best explanation for the past few billion years of life shows that. Is it possible mathematically to recreate the evolutionary events exactly? No, This is simply impossible epistemologically. But we can get good estimate that are probably close to the real - but ultimately unknowable - history. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Milton De Souza Mendonça Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Adding to Mark Mcmenamin's answer, there is much beyond macroevolution and we are still figuring that out as he stated. I would add that apart from outside selective pressures due to negative interactions (predation, parasitism), positive interactions have been paramount to evolutionary changes. All the major transitions in evolution (as per Maynard-Smith) involve organisms "learning" to collaborate to become more efficient - eucaryotic organisms, multicellular organisms, social organisms. This leads to highly non-linear paths for evolution to follow, and steps appear where before the road appeared to be even. Another important phenomenon is niche construction, in which the change exerted by some organisms on the outside environment becomes an extended phenotype. The effects of this extension are not only crucial for the present generation but can be inherited by the following ones, leading again to non-linear interactions between environmental selective pressures and evolutionary responses of the organisms in question. As suggested above by other contributors, the mathematics is much more complicated than simply adding adaptive mutations and subtracting the bad ones... in soma, it could have taken less than 4 billion years for evolution to come to where it is, it could have taken more - it's not simple ballistics. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Peter J Richerson University of California, Davis I think the single most convincing bit of data comes from Philip Gingerich's 1983 classic on rates of evolution, published in Science. Gingerich plotted rates of evolution as estimated from data collected over different time intervals. He plotted lab data using microbial populations, field studies of usually one to a few years, and on out to paleontological time scales. Rates collected at short time scales are ever so much faster than those estimated from the fossil record. The simplest interpretation of this pattern is that selection in the short run is responding to all sorts of noisy environmental variation. The long term net changes in the environment are generally slower, so long term evolution averages out a lot of short term variation. Thus, evolution seems to have ample "reserve capacity." If there had been sustained rapid, directional environmental change, evolution would probably have kept up. Of course in the rare major extinction events, most lineages do fail to keep up with very rapid or very extreme environmental change. But it seems to take only a few million years for diversity to recover after mass extinctions, also suggesting that evolution is a pretty rapid process. The Cambrian explosion that gave us the first diverse fauna of large animals with skeletons was pretty rapid too. It probably represents the first time large volumes of seawater carried enough oxygen to support the high energy physiology necessary for large animals. John Thompson had a book out last year with Chicago entitled Relentless Evolution. He reviews a large number of field and lab studies illustrating the rapidity of everyday evolution in response to selection pressures varying in time and space. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Erik I Svensson Lund University The question is wrongly formulated, as evolution is certainly not driven only by mutations, but also and largely be selection and to a minor extent by genetic drift. The rate of evolution is, in the univariate case and for a single continuous trait: R = h2*S Where R = is per-generation phenotypic response, h2 is narrow-sense heritability and S is the selection differential. This is the so-called "Breeders equation of quantitative genetics". Most morphological traits have heritabilities well above zero, usually around 0.4 on average. It does not require much selection with this high level of heritability and not many generations to turn a mouse in to an elephant, provided that selection is chronic and persistent. Thus, your question should be reformulated: "GIVEN high amount of genetic variation and high heritabilties and strong selection, why has not more evolutionary change happened during 4.5 billion years, and why is stasis more common than change?". The main problem for evolutionary theory is therefore to explain why organisms do not change more often and so slowly, rather than to ask if time is sufficient. It is clearly sufficient, it is MORE than sufficient. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Arieh Ben-Naim Hebrew University of Jerusalem Yes, definitely yes. The proof is the fact that we are here. If it were not possible, no one will be here to ask the question, and , of course, to answer the question Arieh 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Deleted profile Added an answer Genetic drift is not minor in small or isolated populations and can and has had a very great affect on billions of years of evolution. The extent to which mutation drift and selection each have on evolutionary history depends on effective population size, genetic diversity and a host of variables that are analyzed with population genetic techniques that are not as simple as the single equation listed. And it is not true that slow change is a "problem for evolutionary theory". Rapid evolution occurs when changes in environment (say) drive strong selection. But very much selection is stabilizing and slow. Lineages are not compelled to evolve for changes sake. They change in response to drift and selective pressures of a changing environment. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester Asa #Arieh Ben-Naim  well said.

This is ordinary microevolution.

(Note: The adjective "mathematical" is not needed when talking about a probability.) The serious scientific question is in fact the opposite of what was asked here.  To quote from the introduction to HO, S. Y. W., LANFEAR, R., BROMHAM, L., PHILLIPS, M. J., SOUBRIER, J., RODRIGO, A. G. and COOPER, A. (2011), Time-dependent rates of molecular evolution. Molecular Ecology, 20: 3087–3101. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05178.x: "More than half a century ago, Kurtén (1959) found an inverse correlation between the rate of morphological evolution and the time interval over which the rate was measured.  Specifically, the rate of morphological change between successive generations exceeded macroevolutionary rates by several orders of magnitude.  This time-dependent rate pattern was confirmed in a number of subsequent studies, which consistently showed that morphological evolutionary rates appeared faster when measured over shorter timescales (Gingerich 1983, 2001; Roopnarine 2003).  A similar phenomenon has recently emerged in rates of molecular evolution estimated from DNA sequence data.  In particular, there is a striking disparity between spontaneous mutation rates, measured over a small number of generations in studies of pedigrees and laboratory mutation-accumulation lines, and the much lower substitution rates measured over geological time frames (e.g., Parsons et al. 1997; Howell et al. 2003; Santos et al. 2005; Gibbs et al. 2009)."  The authors go on to propose several explanations for the incongruous rapidity of observed short-term mutation rates.

Evolution works with what it has. That's one reason that the engineering is less the perfect. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Christopher J.S. Davis University of Cambridge Yes! 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Ed Landing New York State Museum Ernst Mary probably had one of the best definitions of "evolution"--as the change in gene frequencies in populations of organisms. So, the annual change in flu strains demonstrates evolution as antibody-driven selection on the viruses leads to a change in virus genome, while heavy commercial fishing quickly drives fish to reproduce earlier in life and at smaller growth stages. There likely is no simple mathematical answer to your question as factors well above the level of mutations (of genes, not their product amino acids), such as community evolution are likely the strong selective agents that "drive" episodes of evolutionary radiation. Just as the concepts of a very old Earth and Darwinian evolution accorded with the successive  appearances and extinctions of  magor groups of organisms by the mid-1800s, modern, precise dating techniques (as U-Pb of zircons) help determine rates of major evolutionary replacements. So, I think it can be said that the fossil record and precise age dates show the unlikelihood of useful molecular clocks, but rather great changes in rates of evolution followed by lengthy relative stasis--a really difficult history to model mathematically. 4 Recommendations 4 years ago Hemanta K.

If you mean here on Earth, evolution never stopped, and never will stop as long as life persists.  If you mean elsewhere in the universe, there are, I'm afraid, insufficient data for a meaningful answer.  At least right now -- this is one reason why scientists continue to look within and without.  Within, they try to learn how life originated here, and the conditions under which it happened.  As reasonable ideas for this develop, it may become possible use new observations of distant stars and planets to estimate how often, among Carl Sagan's "billions and billions of stars in billions and billions of galaxies", these conditions may have arisen. 4 Recommendations 4 years ago Hemanta K.

When you consider the exponential nature of evolution across lineages and their interactions, then evolution as we understand it is plausible.  However, the evolution of modern cells (modern as in ~2 bya) is wide open.  Consider further that the traces of life are present in rocks ~4 bya.  We have not got to the bottom of the matter yet, leaving open the possibility of panspermia. That of course opens another can of worms...  Given we know exceedingly little about the conditions under which "life" initiated, it is going to take a lot of work to unravel the mystery of mysteries. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago William Mayor I will begin by stating that I have not looked into this for several years, so things might have changed, but when I last looked into the question of the "Last Universal Common Ancestor" (LUCA) the consensus was that it never existed.

If it has not changed, then the question of genetic diversity shifts because we have a much larger pool to start with then if we have a single set of genes. 4 years ago Hemanta K.

Did evolution come only for a small time interval and then ... the door simply closed? 4 years ago Andrew Derksen Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Wait, what? What do you mean, "stopped evolving"? All of us ["current primates"] continue to experience selective forces and produce offspring with variable hereditary characters resulting in relatively different reproductive success. Evolution is a continuous process. There are probably a number of "incipient" species developing as we speak - but because we are in the middle of the process, it is difficult to see where it will wind up. Examples of potential allopatric speciation: 1.) How many generations before macaques or chimps imported to the United States as research primates and left to retire on open farms in Texas or Florida become zygotically isolated without regular drift from other populations? 2.) What about habitat fragmentation in Africa, Asia, and South America, as development pushes or eliminates bridges between populations? Potential sympatric speciation: 1.) Perhaps human-mediated extinction has eliminated a major competitor or predator from a particular environment; surviving primates now compete to fill that particular niche, or continue to diversify and exploit specialized niches within their own environments. Ongoing major selective forces: 1.) Human development changes habitat drastically, and survivors must adapt or go extinct. 2.) Global warming expands old ranges and changes ecosystems drastically; survivors must adapt or go extinct. 6 Recommendations 4 years ago Demetris Christopoulos National and Kapodistrian University of Athens I see ... probably it is not possible to do a plain conversation without being stoned (two downvotes for a simple question...?)

Your assertion is absolutely false. All the species that exist (or have existed) on this planet continue to evolve ALL THE TIME!  Like Andrew said above, it is a continuous process. Hence present day humans are evolving, just like the present day chimps are. I think your question got down-voted because it is based on a false assertion which betrays a total ignorance about the meaning and mechanisms of evolution! I will try to to compile specific examples of recent human evolution if you are truly interested. Best, ~a. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Demetris Christopoulos National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Dear Amit, I meant the evolution of monkeys to human beings, that's all. Have you any evidence about such a process? 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester Dear Demetris Christopoulos Monkeys did not evolve into human beings. Monkeys and humans had a common ancestor. 4 Recommendations 4 years ago Andrew Derksen Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Mr. Christopoulos, I see from your profile that you are an economist, and perhaps this explains your lack of awareness of certain defining elements of biology. Evolution is a blind and directionless process whose "victories" are only described in terms of a lineage's ability to keep its descendents playing in the game.  It is not a "ladder", with one form of life gradually developing into another in a procedural fashion, and any one being more "advanced" than another. There never was a rank following from bacterium --> protozoan --> sponge --> fish --> reptile --> mammal --> primate --> humanity. All of those organisms are different attempts by competing but distantly related strains of DNA to continue reproducing themselves in the environment. They are all the sophisticated end-products of billions of years of evolutionary history.  All of them continue to evolve as populations! To draw an analogy from a human family tree: you are the most recent end-product of your family's evolutionary history, but this does not deny the possibility that you might also have cousins. Humanity shares a common ancestor with monkeys - just as you and your hypothetical cousin share a common ancestor in your grandparents. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago William Mayor Evolution is a process by which one species or another gradually adapts to better survive in a given ecological niche.  There is some evidence of possible human evolution going on in the gradual increase in the number of people who have the super good form of cholesterol.  All people who have this specific form are descendants of one specific couple, and the normal arterial plaque simply does not develop in their arteries no matter what high cholesterol foods they eat.  These people have a definite survival advantage over the rest of us, and I imagine that eventually this gene will be present in most if not all humans.  However, it will also take a long time to reach that point. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Amit Sinha New England Biolabs Hi Demetris, No I do not have any evidence of any process in which monkeys evolved into humans, because this actually never happened, that is not how evolution works! What I do have evidence for and what actually did happen was this : There was a common ancestor to both humans and monkeys but which itself was neither a monkey nor a human, whose offsprings gave rise to independent lineages / populations, which continued to evolve over many subsequent generations to give rise to the present day monkeys and humans etc. (This is again what Fernando and Andrew have already explained above). Your statement about "evolution of monkeys to human beings" again stems from you having a very wrong concept of evolution! The whole idea of there being a straight line of descent from monkeys to humans is wrong, but unfortunately this is a very common mis-conception that many people continue to have. I think one of the reasons for this is widespread use of cartoons or caricatures in which one starts with a monkey on the left and ends up with a human on the right, but that is just a cartoon and very wrong! So I will just leave you with two images which explain the errors in your understanding of evolution (and perhaps the source of these errors). The key concepts that you need to distinguish between are  "linear descent" versus a "tree of life": Image 1 source : https://matthewbonnan.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/apparently-ive-gone-viral-or-stick-figures-and-evolution/ this_is_evo lution.jpg 198.80 KB 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Amit Sinha New England Biolabs and Image 2 source: http://alwaysquestionauthority.com/2013/06/10/evolution-this-is-not-evolution-this-is-evolution-richard-dawkins/ this_is_evol ution2.jpg 432.60 KB 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter J Richerson University of California, Davis Demetris, There is lots of neat work on human genetic responses to selection in the present and recent past.

Glosochronometric research [excuse my scientiese -estimating the lenght of time since two languajes diverged, i.e. French and Spanish from Latin since the low middle ages]. This cannot be measured in DNA differences, but with computers that understand words and grammar, our philologist colleagues have done a good job. It strikes me that punctuated events also exist with languages, in the form of lost/gained battles between peoples, the dominance of one and the extinction of the other carries over to their languages. Defeat of the other side in Roncesvalles would made Spanish and French dialects of Arabic. The vagaries of history and the branching/mixing of our ~6000  tongues has been stopped recently, with the imposition of a central dialect for families such as Spanish (Mexican accent), French (Parisian), Italian (Tuscan), English (-a problem here), etc., due to the ubiquity of radio and tv programs in those central dialects. Perhaps species and linguistic evolution depart into two dynamics, with the latter becoming frozen in time, with only a couple of hundred being used as "national" languages, Further differences to ponder:  What is the meaning of a lingua franca, such as Swahili or Bahasa Indonesia, or the various pidgins and creolles? (interspecies breeding?)  What about Hebrew, or classical Greek vs. Demoticos? (resurrection of one, cheap magic of the other?). It is probably true that the rules of linguistic change have changed from species evolution to a new set of rules due to government, massive comunication and globalization. (Are we not depleting the natural biodiversity to just a few useful species?) 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Peter J Richerson University of California, Davis Actually, surprisingly perhaps, languages continue to evolve. Many small languages are going extinct while dialects of big languages continue to change. A rough generalization is that wherever social fault lines arise, language differences tend to emerge. William Labov, the pioneer student of the microevolution of dialect, produced two big treatises.  I don't know of any good reasonably accessible intros to his sociolinguistics work. The most interesting part of the story is that language evolution is led by pre-pubescent girls. Women are more verbal than men and tend to speak more "advanced" versions of local dialects. The ability to master a new dialect shuts down in most people in adolescence. The top-down attempts to control language evolution via official dialects, school instruction, standard broadcast dialects and the like seem to have little effect. Labov, W. (1994).

Malden, MA: Blackwell. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Demetris Christopoulos National and Kapodistrian University of Athens We say the same thing, although you are more specialist in terminology: If you see my first post you will realize that every evolutionary route is locked: It started from the same ancestor, but after then every specie has its own evolution and nothing is happened now for examples to monkeys in order to give them the ability to evolve in a higher intelligence level, ie to become something like a human being. Anyway, I thought that here in RG we can discuss in a different way than like being in a church of a dominant dogma (where if you say something outside the mainstream you will be punished), but I realized that the mentality of the specialists is very similar to those priests that sometimes scientists take as an example to be avoided: "we are scientists, not priests". Sorry, guys but this is similar to a religion, at least for me. As for the main core: I suggest you to do 3 things: 1)relax, it is just a forum 2)read Hesiodos with open mind, without taking every word as exactly its meaning, in order to realize that there have been other 4 evolutionary eras in humanity and we are the fifth attempt 3)after all you read in Hesiodos, think that 200 years of theories is a very small time for such a so strong selfish behaviour. Bye to everybody, I am sorry to realize that modern science and old style religion have so many, so many similar characteristics... 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Andrew Derksen Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service "Every evolutionary route is locked". I suspect that you are not adequately expressing your hypothesis. You're not looking at dogma or ideology, you're starting to ask some of the interesting questions that first year students of biology often ask. You're late to the party. Fortunately, there have been a number of theorists and philosophers who have attempted to address or resolve your questions over the decades. As an example, one of the central themes to Steven Jay Gould's "Wonderful Life" (1990) is to ask the question: if we started the game of life all over again, would it play out in identical fashion? Would we end up with the same phylogenetic diversity we currently have, or might meter-long Anomalocaridids still hunt somewhere along coastal reefs, and mammals never arrived? Alas, this is mostly a rhetorical question. Paleontology is inevitably a historic science; the experiment has already been run and you try and extract what you can from the data. It is very difficult to set up an experiment testing the likelihood of any particular taxon to develop a particular adaptation in response to a particular selective challenge or within a set of unique environmental conditions. There have been some interesting studies with clonal organisms like fungi and bacteria that suggest that minor variations leading to mutation (even among clones!) can be stochastic and therefore similar ancestors can produce very divergent results when you repeat the experiment. These are tough experiments to run, and one needs a large number of test subjects and a long time to run them. On the other end of the spectrum, one of the major "trends" in evolution has been "convergence", in that similar environmental conditions tend to channel organisms into similar bauplan with similar adaptations. The classic example of evolutionary convergence is to compare sharks to the extinct icthyosaurs (aquatic reptiles) and dolphins (aquatic mammals). They share similar body shapes in response to the constraints of their aquatic environment: the laws of physics suggest that this form is a very efficient body shape for a predator to push through water towards prey. Separate lineages, but they all acheived very similar solutions to the problem of moving through water. Why then, as you suggest, have more species not evolved into apparently sentient social organisms? Probably for the same reason that not every lineage has evolved a large-bodied aquatic predator. This ties into a concept related to convergence: competitive inhibition. Not ever major lineage of animals can have a representative fast-moving predator plying the ocean simultaneously. The mammals do not arrive as major aquatic predators until after the reptiles go extinct in the late Cretaceous. Your an economist, so I will draw an analogy: the prominence and sheer success of reptiles as predators prevented a new competitor from entering the market - the entrance costs were too high, and the available competitive niches had already been filled by sharks (who persist undefeated) and reptiles. The human brand of intelligence may be a rare response for a lineage to develop to solve the problem of being alive. Now that it has arrived, it may be difficult for other organisms to develop that same kind of social intelligence and problem-solving capacity that we utilize because we outcompete them in that market. That said, I'd take a good long look at crows, parrots, raccoons, coatis, octopi, and most of the other primates. They are all adept tool-users with some form of social structure - what separates them from us is mostly a matter of degree, and not one of kind. They are all on the list of potential candidates to replace humanity as the primary technology-using species should we drive ourselves (or be helped) into extinction. If you have a couple dozen spare planets or alternate universes to borrow as replicates, and at least a quarter million years to run the experiment, I'd love to see the results. 3 Recommendations 4 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester "Your an economist..." -> You are an economist..." :-) 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Reinhard Stindl Alpharm Inc., Austria It would be great, if at least some of the contemporary researchers would read the old literature again.

He states that the Pleistocene sediments at thousands of collecting sites have uncovered at least 85 % of the mammalian species living today, and therefore the fossil record can no longer be regarded as providing an incomplete picture of evolution (Stanley 1984, p. 97). Most importantly, Stanley mentions the puzzling paleontological fact that within less than 12 million years, most of the living orders of mammals developed, including such diverse animals as lions, wolves, bears, horses, rhinos, deer, pigs, antelopes, sheep, bats and whales, all having descended from a tiny animal resembling a small rodent (Stanley 1984, p. 93). He further concluded: “We can now show that fossil mammal populations assigned to a particular Cenozoic lineage typically span the better part of a million years without displaying sufficient net change to be recognized as a new species. (...) If an average chronospecies lasts nearly a million years, or even longer, and we have at our disposal only ten million years, then we have only ten or 15 chronospecies to align, end-to-end, to form a continuous lineage connecting our primitive little mammal with a bat or a whale” (Stanley 1984, p. 93). “Our only reasonable recourse is to abandon gradualism in favor of punctuated evolution, which can account for the rapid changes for which we see evidence. These changes must have been brought about by strongly divergent steps that came in rapid succession” (Stanley 1984, p. 90)." 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Charles H Stirton University of Cape Town I was intrigued by Peter Richerson's response,easpcially the sentence: "· The most interesting part of the story is that language evolution is led by pre-pubescent girls. Women are more verbal than men and tend to speak more "advanced" versions of local dialects" I have had a long interest in the diversity and evolution of languages, especially as its greatest diversity. With an added  fascination with history I have long pondered the impact that women who were unfortunate to be caputred or enslaved  might have had on the development and spread of bilingualism, dialects, religion, myths, and languages generally. We forget that slavery is very old and something which has happened for most of human history. I think the role of women in language development has been significant but I have not read any real analysis of it. Perhaps others might enlighten me. Another puzzle for me is the Cheetah and the Lion which are genetically very close yet so fundamentally different in habit, physiognomy, and ethology. Doe snayone know when they diverged? In the organisms that I study (Fabaceae) there are some genera with over 70 species yet which have a crown clade age of less than 2 million years. I know of other examples in other genera (eg. Andean Lupinus). That is rapid evolution indeed. Finally,  Economists differentiate between arithmetic growth and geometric growth. Perhaps these are at play in the evolutionary lottery and it is molecualr pathway complexity that is evolving differentailly? 4 years ago Benjamin Cornelius Ruth Not applicable I apologise for my lateness in joining this post (in some ways 23 years). But what delicious answers and examples. And so refreshing to see linguistics and economics in the fray. So, please forgive my possibly outdated and rusty triple of "what if's" around the philosophy of William of Ockham's famous razor but I am somewhat saddened that Neo-Darwinism is still appearing to force awkward timescales into the paradigm of random mutation separate from environmental drivers as the "blind clock maker" of life's staggering complexity. To whit: 1. What if saltatory and explosive speciation along with evolutionary conservatism actually are exactly what they appear to be and rates of evolution are largely independent of the inefficiency of expressions of chance mutation at given loci? 2. What if "natural selection" exists as only a (small) part of the majority of evolution processes? And really, the crux of the argument (as such as it is): 3. Wouldn't pure natural selection in the first instance select those individuals and populations that were able to evolve, or not evolve, efficiently and in concert with the environment in which they live? I posit that as an argument in logic unfettered by perceived wisdom and current paradigms these are three points worthy of proper consideration (the last particularly). The simplest explanations for the phenomena of the diversity of life that we observe around us and in the the fossil record (for example the explosive post Cretaceous Pleistocene mammal divergence mentioned above) are probably correct. What the mechanisms might be is surely where it becomes fun again. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Christopher James Davia @Demitris, I think that the answer to your question is that we are here. Monkeys will only evolve into a new niche if it is free. Also, your perspective assumes some sort of innate driving force to evolve. My own view is  that it is the environment that drives evolution. 1 Recommendation 4 years ago Nick Dana Lawrence Waters There is a lot of merit to saltational evolution; in particular to chromosomal re-arrangement, duplication.  Novel body plans and adaptation arise from replicate DNA that then drifts.  Gould's ideas were good, but needed molecular verification. The jury is still out, but the evidence is piling up. 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Reinhard Stindl Alpharm Inc., Austria There were many others before Gould, who insisted in saltatory evolution. Theodor Eimer, Otto H. Schindwolf and Richard Goldschmidt. Unfortunately, the gradualistic model prevailed. Please read Otto H. Schindewolf's most famous book. http://books.google.at/books/about/Basic_Questions_in_Paleontology.html?id=WzDfOuHgBzMC&redir_esc=y 2 Recommendations 4 years ago Nick Dana Lawrence Waters Thank you, you are right. I had forgotten the paleontological literature. 4 years ago Kenneth Pharr Dalton State College Yes, if you take Scott Aaronson's ideologies ( a professor at MIT) he mathematically shows that genetic mutations are not commpletly random, but rather randomly guided. This meaning evolution does not have to back peddle, but rather when a mutation happens (and doesn't help) the species dies off, but if it does favor the species it stays around. By this method there would need far less time for a certain species to evolve. Thus, proving Darwin's theory of natural selection. 4 years ago Benjamin Cornelius Ruth Not applicable And it's not beyond reason to expect Natural Selection per se to have long ago (the Pre-Cambrian phylogenetic explosion is a tempting conjecture on this point) to favour those species that develop a range of abilities to evolve efficiently in concert with environmental conditions and therefore bring evolution out of the cold and more in line with the negative homeostatic physiological feedback loops that define the natural world yet are not permitted in the world of the Neo-Darwinist. If the visible evidence is accepted at face value through the simple application of Occam’s Razor the paradox of saltatory (e.g. explosive speciation in new habitat e.g. Lake Malawi cichlids and after major extinction events) and conservative evolution seen in both the fossil record and in species extant today will  be seen for what it is instead of the increasingly fraught epicycles of explanation of an increasingly marginalised Neo-Darwinism paradigm of random mutations at a specific loci as the main driver of evolution. With a little more open-minded approach to research in this field it might be discovered that life long ago learnt the ability to shape its own future by reducing the vast and unpredictable waste of random expressed mutation through various strategies to diversify or to retain stasis as the situation requires. What those mechanisms might be, and following the logic of from observations there may be at least two (to conserve or to evolve) then evolutionary biology may finally escape the strictures of a well over past sell date theory. When this long overdue paradigm shift does occur (I certainly expected it to have happened by now and it’s a sad testament to the conservativeness of our times that it hasn’t despite the masses of evidence to the contrary) then, and only then, would evolutionists have a coherent argument against intelligent design and creationists per se. Reading this back I see I have clearly crossed into the realms of fancy where the integrity of rigorous and imaginative scientific enquiry has trumped self-perpetuating conservatism. The reality appears instead that the ideals of the scientific method have been subsumed by ever tighter involuted circles of the scientific establishment no doubt reinforced by ever safer funding requests in the face of ever tighter funding availability maintained by the self-congratulatory clique of the current paradigm’s fundamentalists. In such way does science discredit itself and in such ways does it show that, as in religion, it too can fall to the ego and the unimaginative human slaves of doctrine. 1 Recommendation 2 years ago Erkki J. Brändas Uppsala University My answer would be no. For a recent argument see the reference to Rosenberg (2013 ) below. Note that I refer to the quote below as an improbable statement that has a physicalist content, not yet complete. Alexander Rosenberg, well-known philosopher of physics says by referring to adaptation as an asymmetric process (i) driven by the second law, and (ii) requiring it to be wasteful processes, using up more order in producing adaptations than the order that the adaptations constitute and maintain, writing: It’s clear that the only way to build adaptations consistent with these two requirements is to start by processes that randomly build large numbers of alternative molecular structures just through the operation of thermodynamic noise and then wait. Wait for what? For one or more molecules to turn up randomly that combines thermodynamic stability with replicability.  Eventually out of shear thermodynamic noise there may come to be a molecular structure sufficient to withstand the local environment and that also encourages the emergence of copies of itself out of the atoms floating around in the thermodynamic noise . This can happen by templating, catalysing or otherwise producing copies of itself. You probably don’t have to wait more than 500 million years , once the chemical constituents of the early earth were around for this to start to happen. Once it does happen, iteration of the same process will produce more and more adaptation, at greater and greater expense, just as the 2d law requires. The crucial question is whether we have “at home” all the laws of nature needed to understand how evolution do indeed “produce us”. 2 Recommendations 2 years ago Mark McMenamin Mount Holyoke College In reply to Erkki Brändas, I would say that the most difficult (and fastest?) major leap in evolution was the first one, the biopoesis transition from non-life to life. If you add an additional factor, namely, the fact that the primordial or Haldane Soup is loaded with toxic compounds able to poison any synthetic pathway you can imagine, then not only is there insufficient time, it may be mathematically impossible. Vladimir Vernadsky made Oparin furious with his talk of bio-inert matter, inert matter, etc. to illustrate his view that life was as old as matter and energy. Vernadsky thus became the first to stare deeply into this greatest and most gaping chasm in our scientific landscape. 1 Recommendation 2 years ago Fernando Soares Schlindwein University of Leicester Yes. The time constants we know have been obtained by observation of what is happening now. Time constants could have been different in the past. Also, this is not a simple linear problem and, as chaos theory tells us, if there was a lucky break early on, then the whole thing would be much quicker. Finally, the good old argument: We are here. Or you guys believe that the gods were astronauts? 2 Recommendations 2 years ago Erkki J. Brändas Uppsala University Dear Mark, Thanks for your comments. In a sense I agree that there is a gap in "our scientific landscape". Note for instance the critical statements made by Thomas Nagel in "MIND & COSMOS: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False", Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York. The book did cause an uproar amongst physicists and philosophers, but despite many negative recensions, I have not seen any serious argument against the neo-Vernadsky criticism of a "gaping chasm". Chemical reactions produce large molecules but do not provide adaptation. Furthermore Neo-Darwinistic laws , including natural selection and the genetic code depend on causal forces and teleonomic laws (see Mayr for definition) and moreover, causality is needed to instigate adaptation. Therefore physics cannot rule out either causality, despite their absence on the fundamental microscopic level, nor progressions that rely on encoded processes . By indiscriminately ruling out intentionality one risks “throwing out the baby with the bath water”. An extension of the picture, contained in Rosenberg's quote, is necessarily needed in order to rigorously contain adaptability in general and the genetic code in particular, including its more subtle variations, as closed or open programs, mapping various evolutionary situations, like for instance those for insects or humans. 2 years ago Erkki J. Brändas Uppsala University I have voiced an opinion, based on my professional life as chemical physicist.

Chapter · Jan 2012 Ahmad Atif Ahmad Read Theological philosophy: Rethinking the rationality of Christian faith [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT:  For much of the modern period, theologians and philosophers of religion have struggled with the problem of proving that it is rational to believe in God. Drawing on the thought of Thomas Aquinas, Theological Philosophy seeks to overturn the longstanding problem of proving faith's rationality and to establish instead that rationality requires to be explained by appeals to faith. Building on a constructive argument developed in a companion book, Rationality as Virtue, Lydia Schumacher advances the conclusion that belief in the God of Christian faith provides an exceptionally robust rationale for rationality and is as such intrinsically rational. At the same time, Schumacher overcomes a common tendency to separate spiritual from ordinary life, and construes the latter as the locus of proof for the rationality of Christian faith.
