The BabyCenter Editorial Team     No. You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant.  Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy . Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them. But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.  Menstruation only happens when you're not pregnant: Each month, your uterus grows a thick blood-rich lining in preparation for an egg to embed there. If you don't get pregnant that month, you shed this tissue and blood – that's your menstrual period.  But once an egg embeds in the uterine lining, hormones tell the blood-rich tissue to stay intact to support the growing baby . And you won't shed it and start having your period again until your pregnancy is over.  What is implantation bleeding? Implantation bleeding is a very early sign of pregnancy. Learn to tell the difference between implantation bleeding and menstruation with Dr. Calhoun. See all videos  Bleeding occurs during pregnancy for various reasons, some serious and some not. Some women have light bleeding or spotting in the week before their period is due and they may mistake that for a period. It's generally a lot lighter than a typical period and lasts just a day or two.  This spotting has been called " implantation bleeding " because of the idea that it might be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of the uterus. But no one knows what really causes it.  You may have spotting after a Pap smear, vaginal exam, or sex. This is because there's more blood going to your cervix during pregnancy.  Bleeding can also be a sign of something seriously wrong, such as an infection, placental problems, miscarriage , or an ectopic pregnancy , which can be life-threatening. (See our article on vaginal bleeding in pregnancy for a complete rundown of possible causes.)  If you notice bleeding while you're pregnant, call your doctor or midwife right away, even if the bleeding has stopped. Many women who bleed a little during pregnancy deliver without complications, but you may need an evaluation to rule out a serious problem.  If you're actively bleeding or have severe pain of any kind and can't immediately reach your practitioner, head straight to the emergency room.  Am I Pregnant? Take our quiz and find out.

Very interesting, but sometimes heavy bleeding is considered quite normal. In other cases it can be the sign of a serious threat to the future child`s health. Everything depends on the causes of this phenomenon.  Read also: Does Implantation Bleeding Have Clots?  Can Implantation Bleeding Be Heavy?  Can Implantation Bleeding Be Bright Red?  Best Basal Thermometers for Menstrual Cycle  Implantation Bleeding  Implantation bleeding is one of the normal pregnancy signs that occur when the fertilized egg is implanting itself into the uterine wall. It is the first identifiable symptom of pregnancy. This bleeding does not occur in all women in their early pregnancy stage and there is also a high likelihood that the woman may fail to recognize it even if it will occur. Therefore, we first recommend using an early pregnancy tests if you have recently had an intimate relationship and pregnancy is possible .  The best can be considered Utilax and Utilax 2 which can show you a positive result already two days after conception, long before the implantation period.  Or the pregnancy test Value Patsk which will determine the pregnancy six days before the menstrual cycle.     Some women also mistake this type of spotting with the beginning of the menstrual period, which may mess up the calculation of the fetus age. In some instances, heavy implantation bleeding can also occur but should only last for a short period of time.  When Does Implantation Bleeding Occur?  Implantation bleeding usually takes place on the 10-14th day after conception and occurs before the expected menstrual period . For instance, if you have conceived on the 5th day, you are likely to experience this type of bleeding between the 17th and 29th day.  How Does Implantation Bleeding Occur?  Egg embedment spotting is a bloody discharge, which appears as a result of the actual (physical) implantation of the fertilized ovum into the uterus. The egg attaches itself to the endometrial lining from which it will extract the blood and various nutrients needed for its growth and development. If the fertilization had not occurred, the ovum would have been discharged out as the normal period flow. However, when the ovum is about to implant itself, it slowly enters the uterus and tries to embed into the endometrial lining. During this process some blood from the blood vessels can be released, which is discharged via the vagina. This spotting is called implantation bleeding . This is a normal condition and should not cause any worries. Implantation bleeding occurs much earlier than the pregnancy can be confirmed, so such spotting or period lighter than normal are actually the earliest symptoms of pregnancy.  If you are reading this text then you may need the following things:    Panty liners – During implantation bleeding, you need carefully monitor the amount of secretions to quickly recognize abnormalities and prevent them.   Intimate Wash gel should be used by every self-respecting woman. It will help to get rid of dirt and smell. Quality Intimate Wash gel, in contrast to conventional soap and shower gel, helps maintain the pH balance in the norm, which favorably affects the microflora.   Feminine Wipes are intended for intimate hygiene if there is no possibility of washing by the usual method as well as during excessive discharges or the menstrual cycle. They will also be useful during the trip.   Probiotic Feminine Supplement is needed to balance yeast and bacteria in the female body. During pregnancy many women can face such a disease as thrush in an aggravated form, which hasn’t shown itself before the expected conception. Therefore, you need to balance the right amount of bacteria and yeast in your body before conception.   Vaginal Suppositories is a remedy that will help cope with vaginal acidic fluid, odor, itching, dryness and yeast infections. If you have one of the above symptoms then it is worthwhile to postpone pregnancy planning and undergo a course of treatment for Vaginal Suppositories. .   Prenatal Vitamins for Pregnancy will provide your body and your child with all the necessary vitamins and microelements for healthy development and normal pregnancy.    Signs of Implantation Bleeding  Signs of implantation bleeding vary from one woman to another. Some ladies never experience this kind of bloody discharge during early stages of their pregnancies, the others face it only during the first term and carry the second child without any signs. Anyway implantation bleeding must be always mild in nature and thinner in consistency if compared with regular menstrual periods.  The Color of Implantation Bleeding  The color of implantation bleeding varies from bright red and light pink to brown. Bright red or pink bloody discharge is a likely indicator that implantation has just occurred or rather the blood is flowing from active area within the womb to the vagina very quickly.  Brown implantation bleeding indicates that this is old blood. This means that when the fertilized egg was attaching itself deep into the womb, it released a small amount of blood. This bleeding occurred during implantation and stayed in the womb for some time, thus by the moment it got discharged, it had turned brown in color.  Cramps and Implantation Bleeding  Cramps can happen both with implantation bleeding and on its own, without any bloody discharge. Such spasms are generally mild. Cramps happen when the fertilized egg buries itself deep into the womb and the womb`s muscles start to contract. These contractions cause pressure on nerve endings resulting in mild menstrual-like pains that usually last for 24-48 hours.  How Long Does Implantation Bleeding Last?  Implantation spotting typically lasts for a few minutes or a few hours. Sometimes it can stop only after 2-3 days. If implantation bleeding lasts more than three days, this is totally abnormal and may be a sign of vaginal infection and even a miscarriage.  Heavy Implantation Bleeding  In some cases women can experience heavy implantation bleeding. In general, such intense bloody discharge is not normal. In most cases it is not a good sign at all. Just as mentioned earlier, normal implantation bleeding is brown or pink in color and not in high volume, because the ovum size is not very large, it can`t destruct blood vessels so much. Thus in such cases, bleeding should not be heavy at all. As a matter of fact, the amount of blood is so small that it rarely flows out as happens during the menses. If it occurs, it is in the form of several blood drops, though not necessarily.  Some women experience heavy discharge accompanied with strong cramps during implantation. Be careful, these spasms may be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy. Moreover, heavy bleeding is likely to occur when the fertilized ovum is attached to the abdomen, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, or other uterus tissues. In case of such incidences heavy bleeding is likely to be accompanied by such symptoms as dizziness, shoulder aches, pelvic pains, bloody discharge with clots, and so on.  What to Do When You Experience Heavy Implantation Bleeding  In some cases heavy implantation bleeding is considered a normal occurrence, but if heavy blood flow continues for more than three days, you are advised to seek medical attention. If you experience heavy implantation bleeding accompanied by the above mentioned symptoms, it is a must to consult a doctor immediately. You should also seek medical attention if you experience at least one of the following symptoms:   Prolonged, heavy vaginal bleeding even after the pregnancy has already been confirmed.  Normal or heavy menstruation after you have reached menopause.  Prolonged heavy bleeding during your normal menstrual period.  Vaginal bleeding or discharge accompanied by such symptoms as an extreme dizziness and acute pain .   You should not ignore your body`s signals and delay an appointment with your doctor if something looks strange and abnormal. Almost all the diseases which cause unpleasant symptoms can be more or less easy treated during early stages of pregnancy . You should keep in mind that the more you delay, the worse your situation gets and the more difficult it will be for even the best specialist in the world to correct your situation.

Find out why it's not possible to have your period when you're pregnant and why some women do have bleeding.          The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 231 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   They taught us in school or should I say Child development that you can have a regular period when your pregnant, just there is no egg released b/c your already pregnant. I didn't believe this until my cousin told me that during her whole preg she had a regular menstrual period, a week before she delivered she had a cycle, and that goes for both her children. So yes it is very possible to have a period and still be pregnant just your one of the unlucky few who don't get to enjoy the dry spell for nine months.                 jsmom09    Answered 8/26/07                204 found this helpful     was facing the same problem and nobody could tell me for sure if I&#39;m pregnant or not except one man who does it just by looking at your pics.

YES!! i know this for a fact because ir happened to me!! when i was preg with my 2nd son i had my period all the way till i was 6 months preg, its more common then you would think...a woman can still have her period while preg there just won&#39;t be an egg...hence #your pregnant....hope this helped someone out there...i know this question was asked a long time ago but i still figured i would answer it just in case someone was searching and came across this somehow                 amberssquirreltales    Answered 7/6/13               137 found this helpful     This is what I found: 
While periods cannot happen while you are pregnant, other forms of bleeding are possible and would be difficult to distinguish from a period. (William D. McIntosh, MD, FACOG)

I also found this: Occasionally, ovulation can cause some spotting, which can be mistaken for a period.A woman may think she is safe just at the most unsafe time. Bleeding may represent implantation of a fertilized ovum, too. (ivillage.com)

Remember: The best way to find out if you're pregnant when a pregnancy test is negative (b/c you CAN have a false negative...) is to go to your OB and get a blood test. Sometimes the PG hormone is faint and hard to detect...but that doesn't mean it's not there...                 Ldybug1113    Answered 8/24/07               120 found this helpful     It's very possible to be pregnant have your period. I had a normal period just before I found out that I was pregnant. My period ended on a Monday. I had symptoms right after it ended. Nausea, dizziness, breast tenderness, headaches, bloating, food cravings. Didn't think anything of it until 7 days later when I was still feeling nauseated. I went to the store and bought two pregnancy tests. They both came up positive right away. Went to the doctor and found out I was pregnant for sure. So, yes, you can have a few menstrual cycles while pregnant.

Well I had a regular period in May and in June it was a week late. Numerous times after the May period and during the week of the late June period we had sex. The day my period finally came in June I left for some military training in another state that would last 30 days. This period was regular, sort of heavy, and lasted about 5 days. So my July period was supposed to come on about two days before I returned home but it didnt. Last week I found out I was pregnant. So I had to get pregnant before I had that period in June. So either it was not what you call a period or it can happen!

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     No. You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant.  Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy . Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them. But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.  Menstruation only happens when you're not pregnant: Each month, your uterus grows a thick blood-rich lining in preparation for an egg to embed there. If you don't get pregnant that month, you shed this tissue and blood – that's your menstrual period.  But once an egg embeds in the uterine lining, hormones tell the blood-rich tissue to stay intact to support the growing baby . And you won't shed it and start having your period again until your pregnancy is over.  What is implantation bleeding? Implantation bleeding is a very early sign of pregnancy. Learn to tell the difference between implantation bleeding and menstruation with Dr. Calhoun. See all videos  Bleeding occurs during pregnancy for various reasons, some serious and some not. Some women have light bleeding or spotting in the week before their period is due and they may mistake that for a period. It's generally a lot lighter than a typical period and lasts just a day or two.  This spotting has been called " implantation bleeding " because of the idea that it might be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of the uterus. But no one knows what really causes it.  You may have spotting after a Pap smear, vaginal exam, or sex. This is because there's more blood going to your cervix during pregnancy.  Bleeding can also be a sign of something seriously wrong, such as an infection, placental problems, miscarriage , or an ectopic pregnancy , which can be life-threatening. (See our article on vaginal bleeding in pregnancy for a complete rundown of possible causes.)  If you notice bleeding while you're pregnant, call your doctor or midwife right away, even if the bleeding has stopped. Many women who bleed a little during pregnancy deliver without complications, but you may need an evaluation to rule out a serious problem.  If you're actively bleeding or have severe pain of any kind and can't immediately reach your practitioner, head straight to the emergency room.  Am I Pregnant? Take our quiz and find out.

Medically reviewed by Janine Kelbach, RNC-OB on  March 7, 2016 — Written by Rachel Nall, RN, BSN, CCRN If you’re trying to get pregnant (or  trying not to get pregnant), tracking your cycle is important. It will help you keep track of the most fertile days when you can more easily conceive.  A common fertility myth is that a woman can’t get pregnant when she’s on her period. While the odds for pregnancy are lower on the days you’re on your period, they aren’t zero.  Here’s what you need to know about fertility and having sex on your period.  How Does Conception Occur?  The ability to conceive is miraculous. It requires the meeting of a male’s sperm with a female’s egg. Once a woman’s ovary releases an egg, the egg lives for only between 12 and 24 hours. The male sperm can live for about three days.  The typical female cycle is 28 days. Day 1 is when she starts her period. A woman typically ovulates around day 14 (but it could be around days 12, 13, or 14).  Ovulation is when a woman’s ovary releases an egg for fertilization. If a sperm is available in the uterus, pregnancy can occur.  Ovulation can vary based on a woman’s cycle. Some women have a longer cycle of around 35 days between periods. Ovulation would then happen around day 21. Women with a shorter cycle of 21 days ovulate around day 7.  How Can a Woman Get Pregnant on Her Period?  It’s easy to mistake vaginal bleeding for the beginning of a period. It’s possible you could bleed during ovulation when you’re most fertile. This could easily be mistaken for a period. Having unprotected sex at this time dramatically increases your chances of becoming pregnant.  For the average woman, the ovulation cycle is somewhere between 28 and 30 days. This means that if you have sex while on your period, you won’t likely ovulate until several days later. But women with a shorter cycle wouldn’t have the same amount of time between having their periods and ovulating.  Another consideration is that a man’s sperm can live inside a woman for up to 72 hours after ejaculation. Toward the end of your period, your chances of becoming pregnant will increase.  If you’re curious about your ovulation patterns, you can track the number of days between your periods. This includes when you start your period, and then when you start your period again. Over several months, you can identify a pattern to determine roughly when your ovulation cycle occurs.  What Are the Chances a Woman Can Get Pregnant on Her Period?  A woman’s likelihood of getting pregnant can rise and fall throughout her ovulation cycle. While the average female’s monthly cycle may be 29 days, others may have a cycle that varies from 20 to 40 days, or longer.  The likelihood that a woman will get pregnant one to two days after she starts bleeding is nearly zero. But the likelihood starts to increase again with each successive day, even though she’s still bleeding. At roughly day 13 after starting her period, her chance of pregnancy is an estimated 9 percent.  While these numbers may be low, it doesn’t mean a woman can ever be 100 percent assured that she won’t get pregnant on her period.  Birth Control Precautions  If you’re trying to get pregnant, having sex on your period won’t likely help you to conceive unless your menstrual cycle is less than 28 days. But it’s always possible that you could become pregnant.  If you’re not trying to become pregnant, it’s important to have protected sex every time. This includes using some form of contraception like wearing a condom or taking birth control pills .  Birth control pills will not provide a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases like herpes , gonorrhea , or chlamydia . To protect yourself from unwanted infections, have your partner wear a condom.  The Takeaway  A woman’s ovulation cycles can vary, so it’s statistically possible you could become pregnant while on your period. While pregnancy is less likely in the earlier days of your period, the chances increase in the later days.  If you’re trying to become pregnant and haven’t conceived after a year or more of having unprotected sex, contact your doctor. They can recommend methods of tracking your ovulation, as well as fertility experts. They can provide testing and treatments that will help you increase your chances of conception.

Build Number: 12823 Newsletter Can You Get Your Period and Still Be Pregnant? Medically reviewed by Kimberly Dishman, MSN, WHNP-BC, RNC-OB on  October 31, 2016 — Written by Kristeen Cherney Are you pregnant? Early pregnancy causes Late pregnancy causes Bottom line Intro  No. Despite all of the claims out there, it isn’t possible to have a period while you’re pregnant. During early pregnancy, you might experience “spotting,” which is usually light pink or dark brown in color. As a rule of thumb, the American Pregnancy Association states: “If you’re bleeding enough to fill pads and tampons, then this would be a good indication that you’re probably not pregnant.”  Are you pregnant? Period
vs. pregnancy  Your period is a monthly event that occurs in lieu of an egg becoming fertilized. Eggs are released once a month from the ovary. When they aren’t fertilized, the egg travels out of the uterus and sheds through the vagina. Bleeding during a “normal” period often starts off light, then gets heavier and darker red. It also lightens in color and quantity toward the end of the cycle.  The differences between menstruation and being pregnant are supposed to be clear-cut: Once you’re pregnant, you don’t get periods anymore. Unfortunately, it isn’t always so obvious. Some women claim they’ve gotten periods while pregnant. Fueling some of the inquiries in the “periods while pregnant” conspiracy are social media, blogs, and even television shows like “I Didn’t Know I Was Pregnant .”  Bleeding isn’t necessarily a sign of something bad. Many women go on to have healthy babies after experiencing spotting during their first trimester. If you do bleed during pregnancy, it’s related to something else other than regular menstruation.  After all, periods only happen when you’re not pregnant. Learn about the different types of bleeding during pregnancy and when you need to call your OB-GYN.  Early pregnancy causes Causes
of bleeding during the first trimester  Between 25 and 30 percent of women spot during early pregnancy. Some of the causes are:  implantation bleeding changes in the cervix infection molar pregnancy (abnormal mass fertilizes instead of a fetus) ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside of the uterus) early signs of a miscarriage  Implantation bleeding  This happens in the earliest stages of pregnancy. At this point, you likely haven’t even gotten a pregnancy test yet. This type of bleeding occurs when the fertilized egg implants into the uterus, usually around the time your period would be expected. Implantation bleeding is sometimes mistaken by pregnant women as a period, though the bleeding is usually light or spotting.  Shortly after pregnancy, you might also experience spotting from cervical changes. Unless there’s an infection, this isn’t often cause for concern.  Other causes  Other types of early bleeding that can indicate an emergency medical issue include:  infections ectopic pregnancy molar pregnancy miscarriage  These can also be accompanied by:  severe cramps or abdominal pain back pain faintness or losing consciousness fatigue shoulder pain fever vaginal discharge changes uncontrollable nausea and vomiting  The bleeding is also much heavier, unlike spotting. It’s more like a normal period.  Late pregnancy causes Causes
of bleeding during second and third trimesters  Bleeding beyond the first trimester is usually a sign that something is wrong. Regardless of whether bleeding during the second and third trimester is light or heavy, with or without any other symptoms, you need to call your doctor for an emergency visit.  Common causes of bleeding during the rest of pregnancy include:  term or preterm labor or cervical dilation miscarriage placenta previa placental abruption uterine rupture (rare) vasa previa (rare)  Preterm labor  This refers to any birth that happens before 37 weeks. Before preterm labor, some women experience symptoms similar to a period, as well as a large amount of mucus discharge. While cramping may also be felt, preterm labor also causes contractions. Symptoms of preterm labor might also include backache, a sensation of pressure in the vagina, and changes in discharge.  Placenta previa  This happens when the placenta is implanted low in the uterus and very close to, or covers the cervix. The bleeding varies, but there are no other symptoms. Placenta previa can hinder labor and delivery.  Placental abruption  This occurs most commonly during the last few months of pregnancy. The placenta detaches from the uterus, usually causing heavy bleeding and possibly severe stomach pain and cramping. Certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, can increase the risk for placental abruption.  Uterine rupture  A uterine rupture means that the muscle of the uterus separates or tears. This can cause uncontrolled bleeding. In the United States, it occurs most commonly in women who have delivered via cesarean delivery in the past. Though rare, this type of tear happens on old scar lines along the uterus.  Many of the conditions that happen in the latter part of pregnancy cause bleeding and other symptoms similar to a period. But, these are not really menstruation.  Bottom line Bottom
line  It’s not possible to get your period while pregnant, but many pregnant women experience similar symptoms of a period during their first trimesters. These include:  vaginal bleeding (light, and short-term) light cramping fatigue irritability lower back pain  The difference is that these symptoms are related to your body’s natural preparation methods for pregnancy. If any of the above symptoms are severe or don’t go away, and/or you’re in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, seek immediate care.  Sometimes it’s difficult to tell whether bleeding is indicative of a medical emergency or not. As a rule of thumb, if you are bleeding at any stage of pregnancy, you should call your doctor right away.  Q: What’s the earliest you can test and get a positive pregnancy result? A: Home pregnancy tests measure a level of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the urine. Urine usually has less measurable hormones than blood, so urine tests may not be as accurate early in the pregnancy. Several factors can impact the accuracy of the home urine pregnancy test: the type of test or brand, error in interpreting the results, female cycle length, and interference from another diagnosis or treatment are a few examples. The best time to take a home pregnancy test is at the time of a missed menstrual cycle. However, even on the first day after a missed period, more than a third of pregnant women will have a negative home pregnancy test result. Some women report having positive results before the date of their expected menstrual cycle, though this isn’t common.

Share          Expert Answer       Deborah Taylor  Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist     Not really. Once your body starts producing the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), your periods will stop.  However, you may be pregnant and have light bleeding at about the time that your period would have been due. This type of bleeding in early pregnancy is surprisingly common.  Early bleeding is most likely to be caused by the placenta developing. Once an embryo has implanted in your womb (uterus), the cells and tissues of the placenta start to grow. But until the placenta is established enough to become your baby's lifeline, your body does the job of supplying your growing baby with nutrients and oxygen.  By about six weeks of pregnancy, the placenta is big and complex enough to take over the job of nourishing your baby. It's at this point that you may get some light bleeding.  It’s only natural to be worried if you're pregnant and you have spotting or bleeding . Tell your doctor or midwife , just in case.  Sadly, bleeding can sometimes be the first sign of a miscarriage . Bleeding from a miscarriage can sometimes feel like a period, but it's usually heavier, with more painful tummy cramps.   Ectopic pregnancy is another type of worrying bleeding, when the embryo implants in a fallopian tube instead of the womb. Ectopic pregnancy usually causes dark or watery bleeding, and sharp pains in your lower tummy, especially on one side. It needs swift treatment, so call your doctor if you have these symptoms.  Although it’s most likely that your bleeding is nothing to worry about, your midwife may suggest checks, to make sure your pregnancy is going well.  If you’re only just pregnant, your midwife may offer a blood test to check your hormone levels, or she may refer you to an early pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU) for an early scan .

Expecting Mothers Expect Better.      9 Reasons Why You Think You’re Having Your Period While Pregnant    Facebook 0 Google+ 0 Twitter 0 Pinterest 0 We have been brought up to believe that you are not supposed to have your period while you are pregnant. In fact one of the simplest ways to tell that you are pregnant is by noting the number of missed periods that you have during the early stages of the pregnancy. However, it is not uncommon for some women to go through a light spotting that is similar to a period during their pregnancy. If you are one of these women, do not fear as this is more common than you think. Women of all ages and from all walks of life have reportedly had several bouts of bleeding and spotting while pregnant, so before you jump to any conclusions, stay calm and consult a doctor for a proper check up.         How Often Does This Happen?  While some women have reports of spotting and slight bleeding well into their second and third trimesters, many women tend to have this problem at the early stages of their pregnancy. At the end of the day, it depends on the woman and how her body reacts to the pregnancy and hormonal changes.  Why Does It Happen?  1. Early Symptoms Of Pregnancy  Spotting or bleeding may indicate pregnancy. This usually happens during the very early stages of the first trimester when you may not even realize that you are pregnant. Besides bloating, breast tenderness and morning sickness, spotting may be an indication that you are pregnant, so take a pregnancy test or visit your doctor to be sure.         2. Implantation Bleeding  This form of bleeding happens up to two weeks after conception. This is when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. It usually takes place around the same time that you can expect your period. Do not worry because this is completely normal and does not require any form of treatment or medication. However, you should know that implantation bleeding is a lot lighter than regular menstruation so if you experience heavy bleeding, seek the advice of a doctor.  3. Breakthrough Bleeding  This form of bleeding can be attributed to hormonal changes. What happens is that pregnancy hormones cover up your regular menstruation cycle. One out of five women will experience breakthrough bleeding so this is relatively normal. This usually happens within the first trimester of the pregnancy and in some cases may drag on into the second trimester. Like implantation bleeding, this will happen around the same time that your menstruation is supposed to arrive. It will only last a couple of days and can be likened to light spotting. Anything too heavy should be taken seriously and that is when you need to see a doctor.  4. Rectal Bleeding  Some pregnant women mistake rectal bleeding for their period. Do not worry if you find blood on your toilet paper or on your underwear. Rectal bleeding can be caused by hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids happen when the blood vessels in and around the anus become swollen. These swollen veins may bleed when you have a bowel movement or wipe too hard. This is common during pregnancy especially during the third trimester. One way to combat this is to consume foods that will keep constipation away like whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables. You should also consume plenty of water and do regular exercise. Many women find yoga to be helpful as it is not too strenuous and encourages physical and mental relaxation. You should also consider switching to a softer toilet paper or use facial tissues instead.         5. Hormonal Changes  A reason why you may menstruate is because of your progesterone level. When you are pregnant, your progesterone level will rise high enough to the point that it will suppress your period. However in some cases, your progesterone may not rise up high enough to completely suppress it, especially during the early stages of your pregnancy. This is when bleeding will occur.  6. Ectopic Pregnancy  An ectopic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg gets implanted outside of the uterus, most often within the fallopian tube. Although this is rather uncommon, it happens to one out of 60 women and the symptoms include vaginal bleeding, cramping and pains in the abdominal area. Your doctor will tell you what to do next.  7. Infection or Growth  Infection in the pelvic area or a urinary tract infection may cause you to bleed during your pregnancy. Another reason may be because of an inflamed cervix or growths in the area. The only way to determine if you have these problems is to consult your doctor. He or she will then conduct a series of tests to get a better understanding of what is going on and will aptly advice you on what to do next.  8. Miscarriage  This is by far the worst case scenario. Vaginal bleeding alone does not mean that you are having a miscarriage . Only when the bleeding is coupled with severe cramping in the lower stomach and when you notice tissue being released from the vagina should you be worried. Immediately head to the hospital if you have all the symptoms. This is often the body’s way of telling you that it is an unhealthy pregnancy and that it cannot sustain it to the full term.  9. Labor  Spotting or bleeding that mimics your period may be a sign of early labor. Up to several weeks before your due date, your mucus plug may pass. This mucus will comprise of some blood which could lead you to mistake it for your period. This is usually accompanied by vaginal discharge. This occurrence is also known as pre-term labor and is very common.       Keep in mind that no matter what the cause is, bleeding during your pregnancy should be much lighter than your usual menstruation volume. If you experience heavy bleeding and cramps, seek medical attention immediately as this may be a sign of a miscarriage or a severe problem with either you or the fetus.

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     No. You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant.  Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy . Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them. But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.  Menstruation only happens when you're not pregnant: Each month, your uterus grows a thick blood-rich lining in preparation for an egg to embed there. If you don't get pregnant that month, you shed this tissue and blood – that's your menstrual period.  But once an egg embeds in the uterine lining, hormones tell the blood-rich tissue to stay intact to support the growing baby . And you won't shed it and start having your period again until your pregnancy is over.  What is implantation bleeding? Implantation bleeding is a very early sign of pregnancy. Learn to tell the difference between implantation bleeding and menstruation with Dr. Calhoun. See all videos  Bleeding occurs during pregnancy for various reasons, some serious and some not. Some women have light bleeding or spotting in the week before their period is due and they may mistake that for a period. It's generally a lot lighter than a typical period and lasts just a day or two.  This spotting has been called " implantation bleeding " because of the idea that it might be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of the uterus. But no one knows what really causes it.  You may have spotting after a Pap smear, vaginal exam, or sex. This is because there's more blood going to your cervix during pregnancy.  Bleeding can also be a sign of something seriously wrong, such as an infection, placental problems, miscarriage , or an ectopic pregnancy , which can be life-threatening. (See our article on vaginal bleeding in pregnancy for a complete rundown of possible causes.)  If you notice bleeding while you're pregnant, call your doctor or midwife right away, even if the bleeding has stopped. Many women who bleed a little during pregnancy deliver without complications, but you may need an evaluation to rule out a serious problem.  If you're actively bleeding or have severe pain of any kind and can't immediately reach your practitioner, head straight to the emergency room.  Am I Pregnant? Take our quiz and find out.

Very interesting, but sometimes heavy bleeding is considered quite normal. In other cases it can be the sign of a serious threat to the future child`s health. Everything depends on the causes of this phenomenon.  Read also: Does Implantation Bleeding Have Clots?  Can Implantation Bleeding Be Heavy?  Can Implantation Bleeding Be Bright Red?  Best Basal Thermometers for Menstrual Cycle  Implantation Bleeding  Implantation bleeding is one of the normal pregnancy signs that occur when the fertilized egg is implanting itself into the uterine wall. It is the first identifiable symptom of pregnancy. This bleeding does not occur in all women in their early pregnancy stage and there is also a high likelihood that the woman may fail to recognize it even if it will occur. Therefore, we first recommend using an early pregnancy tests if you have recently had an intimate relationship and pregnancy is possible .

Some women also mistake this type of spotting with the beginning of the menstrual period, which may mess up the calculation of the fetus age. In some instances, heavy implantation bleeding can also occur but should only last for a short period of time.  When Does Implantation Bleeding Occur?  Implantation bleeding usually takes place on the 10-14th day after conception and occurs before the expected menstrual period . For instance, if you have conceived on the 5th day, you are likely to experience this type of bleeding between the 17th and 29th day.  How Does Implantation Bleeding Occur?  Egg embedment spotting is a bloody discharge, which appears as a result of the actual (physical) implantation of the fertilized ovum into the uterus. The egg attaches itself to the endometrial lining from which it will extract the blood and various nutrients needed for its growth and development. If the fertilization had not occurred, the ovum would have been discharged out as the normal period flow. However, when the ovum is about to implant itself, it slowly enters the uterus and tries to embed into the endometrial lining. During this process some blood from the blood vessels can be released, which is discharged via the vagina. This spotting is called implantation bleeding . This is a normal condition and should not cause any worries. Implantation bleeding occurs much earlier than the pregnancy can be confirmed, so such spotting or period lighter than normal are actually the earliest symptoms of pregnancy.  If you are reading this text then you may need the following things:    Panty liners – During implantation bleeding, you need carefully monitor the amount of secretions to quickly recognize abnormalities and prevent them.   Intimate Wash gel should be used by every self-respecting woman. It will help to get rid of dirt and smell. Quality Intimate Wash gel, in contrast to conventional soap and shower gel, helps maintain the pH balance in the norm, which favorably affects the microflora.   Feminine Wipes are intended for intimate hygiene if there is no possibility of washing by the usual method as well as during excessive discharges or the menstrual cycle. They will also be useful during the trip.   Probiotic Feminine Supplement is needed to balance yeast and bacteria in the female body. During pregnancy many women can face such a disease as thrush in an aggravated form, which hasn’t shown itself before the expected conception. Therefore, you need to balance the right amount of bacteria and yeast in your body before conception.   Vaginal Suppositories is a remedy that will help cope with vaginal acidic fluid, odor, itching, dryness and yeast infections. If you have one of the above symptoms then it is worthwhile to postpone pregnancy planning and undergo a course of treatment for Vaginal Suppositories. .   Prenatal Vitamins for Pregnancy will provide your body and your child with all the necessary vitamins and microelements for healthy development and normal pregnancy.    Signs of Implantation Bleeding  Signs of implantation bleeding vary from one woman to another. Some ladies never experience this kind of bloody discharge during early stages of their pregnancies, the others face it only during the first term and carry the second child without any signs. Anyway implantation bleeding must be always mild in nature and thinner in consistency if compared with regular menstrual periods.  The Color of Implantation Bleeding  The color of implantation bleeding varies from bright red and light pink to brown. Bright red or pink bloody discharge is a likely indicator that implantation has just occurred or rather the blood is flowing from active area within the womb to the vagina very quickly.  Brown implantation bleeding indicates that this is old blood. This means that when the fertilized egg was attaching itself deep into the womb, it released a small amount of blood. This bleeding occurred during implantation and stayed in the womb for some time, thus by the moment it got discharged, it had turned brown in color.  Cramps and Implantation Bleeding  Cramps can happen both with implantation bleeding and on its own, without any bloody discharge. Such spasms are generally mild. Cramps happen when the fertilized egg buries itself deep into the womb and the womb`s muscles start to contract. These contractions cause pressure on nerve endings resulting in mild menstrual-like pains that usually last for 24-48 hours.  How Long Does Implantation Bleeding Last?  Implantation spotting typically lasts for a few minutes or a few hours. Sometimes it can stop only after 2-3 days. If implantation bleeding lasts more than three days, this is totally abnormal and may be a sign of vaginal infection and even a miscarriage.  Heavy Implantation Bleeding  In some cases women can experience heavy implantation bleeding. In general, such intense bloody discharge is not normal. In most cases it is not a good sign at all. Just as mentioned earlier, normal implantation bleeding is brown or pink in color and not in high volume, because the ovum size is not very large, it can`t destruct blood vessels so much. Thus in such cases, bleeding should not be heavy at all. As a matter of fact, the amount of blood is so small that it rarely flows out as happens during the menses. If it occurs, it is in the form of several blood drops, though not necessarily.  Some women experience heavy discharge accompanied with strong cramps during implantation. Be careful, these spasms may be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy. Moreover, heavy bleeding is likely to occur when the fertilized ovum is attached to the abdomen, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, or other uterus tissues. In case of such incidences heavy bleeding is likely to be accompanied by such symptoms as dizziness, shoulder aches, pelvic pains, bloody discharge with clots, and so on.  What to Do When You Experience Heavy Implantation Bleeding  In some cases heavy implantation bleeding is considered a normal occurrence, but if heavy blood flow continues for more than three days, you are advised to seek medical attention. If you experience heavy implantation bleeding accompanied by the above mentioned symptoms, it is a must to consult a doctor immediately. You should also seek medical attention if you experience at least one of the following symptoms:   Prolonged, heavy vaginal bleeding even after the pregnancy has already been confirmed.  Normal or heavy menstruation after you have reached menopause.  Prolonged heavy bleeding during your normal menstrual period.  Vaginal bleeding or discharge accompanied by such symptoms as an extreme dizziness and acute pain .   You should not ignore your body`s signals and delay an appointment with your doctor if something looks strange and abnormal. Almost all the diseases which cause unpleasant symptoms can be more or less easy treated during early stages of pregnancy . You should keep in mind that the more you delay, the worse your situation gets and the more difficult it will be for even the best specialist in the world to correct your situation.

Find out why it's not possible to have your period when you're pregnant and why some women do have bleeding.          The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 231 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   They taught us in school or should I say Child development that you can have a regular period when your pregnant, just there is no egg released b/c your already pregnant. I didn't believe this until my cousin told me that during her whole preg she had a regular menstrual period, a week before she delivered she had a cycle, and that goes for both her children. So yes it is very possible to have a period and still be pregnant just your one of the unlucky few who don't get to enjoy the dry spell for nine months.                 jsmom09    Answered 8/26/07                204 found this helpful     was facing the same problem and nobody could tell me for sure if I&#39;m pregnant or not except one man who does it just by looking at your pics.

While periods cannot happen while you are pregnant, other forms of bleeding are possible and would be difficult to distinguish from a period. (William D. McIntosh, MD, FACOG)

I also found this: Occasionally, ovulation can cause some spotting, which can be mistaken for a period.A woman may think she is safe just at the most unsafe time. Bleeding may represent implantation of a fertilized ovum, too. (ivillage.com)

Remember: The best way to find out if you're pregnant when a pregnancy test is negative (b/c you CAN have a false negative...) is to go to your OB and get a blood test. Sometimes the PG hormone is faint and hard to detect...but that doesn't mean it's not there...                 Ldybug1113    Answered 8/24/07               120 found this helpful     It's very possible to be pregnant have your period. I had a normal period just before I found out that I was pregnant. My period ended on a Monday. I had symptoms right after it ended. Nausea, dizziness, breast tenderness, headaches, bloating, food cravings. Didn't think anything of it until 7 days later when I was still feeling nauseated. I went to the store and bought two pregnancy tests. They both came up positive right away. Went to the doctor and found out I was pregnant for sure. So, yes, you can have a few menstrual cycles while pregnant.

Well I had a regular period in May and in June it was a week late. Numerous times after the May period and during the week of the late June period we had sex. The day my period finally came in June I left for some military training in another state that would last 30 days. This period was regular, sort of heavy, and lasted about 5 days. So my July period was supposed to come on about two days before I returned home but it didnt. Last week I found out I was pregnant. So I had to get pregnant before I had that period in June. So either it was not what you call a period or it can happen!

The BabyCenter Editorial Team     No. You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant.  Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy . Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them. But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.  Menstruation only happens when you're not pregnant: Each month, your uterus grows a thick blood-rich lining in preparation for an egg to embed there. If you don't get pregnant that month, you shed this tissue and blood – that's your menstrual period.  But once an egg embeds in the uterine lining, hormones tell the blood-rich tissue to stay intact to support the growing baby . And you won't shed it and start having your period again until your pregnancy is over.  What is implantation bleeding? Implantation bleeding is a very early sign of pregnancy. Learn to tell the difference between implantation bleeding and menstruation with Dr. Calhoun. See all videos  Bleeding occurs during pregnancy for various reasons, some serious and some not. Some women have light bleeding or spotting in the week before their period is due and they may mistake that for a period. It's generally a lot lighter than a typical period and lasts just a day or two.  This spotting has been called " implantation bleeding " because of the idea that it might be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of the uterus. But no one knows what really causes it.  You may have spotting after a Pap smear, vaginal exam, or sex. This is because there's more blood going to your cervix during pregnancy.  Bleeding can also be a sign of something seriously wrong, such as an infection, placental problems, miscarriage , or an ectopic pregnancy , which can be life-threatening. (See our article on vaginal bleeding in pregnancy for a complete rundown of possible causes.)  If you notice bleeding while you're pregnant, call your doctor or midwife right away, even if the bleeding has stopped. Many women who bleed a little during pregnancy deliver without complications, but you may need an evaluation to rule out a serious problem.  If you're actively bleeding or have severe pain of any kind and can't immediately reach your practitioner, head straight to the emergency room.  Am I Pregnant? Take our quiz and find out.

Medically reviewed by Janine Kelbach, RNC-OB on  March 7, 2016 — Written by Rachel Nall, RN, BSN, CCRN If you’re trying to get pregnant (or  trying not to get pregnant), tracking your cycle is important. It will help you keep track of the most fertile days when you can more easily conceive.  A common fertility myth is that a woman can’t get pregnant when she’s on her period. While the odds for pregnancy are lower on the days you’re on your period, they aren’t zero.  Here’s what you need to know about fertility and having sex on your period.  How Does Conception Occur?  The ability to conceive is miraculous. It requires the meeting of a male’s sperm with a female’s egg. Once a woman’s ovary releases an egg, the egg lives for only between 12 and 24 hours. The male sperm can live for about three days.  The typical female cycle is 28 days. Day 1 is when she starts her period. A woman typically ovulates around day 14 (but it could be around days 12, 13, or 14).  Ovulation is when a woman’s ovary releases an egg for fertilization. If a sperm is available in the uterus, pregnancy can occur.  Ovulation can vary based on a woman’s cycle. Some women have a longer cycle of around 35 days between periods. Ovulation would then happen around day 21. Women with a shorter cycle of 21 days ovulate around day 7.  How Can a Woman Get Pregnant on Her Period?  It’s easy to mistake vaginal bleeding for the beginning of a period. It’s possible you could bleed during ovulation when you’re most fertile. This could easily be mistaken for a period. Having unprotected sex at this time dramatically increases your chances of becoming pregnant.  For the average woman, the ovulation cycle is somewhere between 28 and 30 days. This means that if you have sex while on your period, you won’t likely ovulate until several days later. But women with a shorter cycle wouldn’t have the same amount of time between having their periods and ovulating.  Another consideration is that a man’s sperm can live inside a woman for up to 72 hours after ejaculation. Toward the end of your period, your chances of becoming pregnant will increase.  If you’re curious about your ovulation patterns, you can track the number of days between your periods. This includes when you start your period, and then when you start your period again. Over several months, you can identify a pattern to determine roughly when your ovulation cycle occurs.  What Are the Chances a Woman Can Get Pregnant on Her Period?  A woman’s likelihood of getting pregnant can rise and fall throughout her ovulation cycle. While the average female’s monthly cycle may be 29 days, others may have a cycle that varies from 20 to 40 days, or longer.  The likelihood that a woman will get pregnant one to two days after she starts bleeding is nearly zero. But the likelihood starts to increase again with each successive day, even though she’s still bleeding. At roughly day 13 after starting her period, her chance of pregnancy is an estimated 9 percent.  While these numbers may be low, it doesn’t mean a woman can ever be 100 percent assured that she won’t get pregnant on her period.  Birth Control Precautions  If you’re trying to get pregnant, having sex on your period won’t likely help you to conceive unless your menstrual cycle is less than 28 days. But it’s always possible that you could become pregnant.  If you’re not trying to become pregnant, it’s important to have protected sex every time. This includes using some form of contraception like wearing a condom or taking birth control pills .  Birth control pills will not provide a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases like herpes , gonorrhea , or chlamydia . To protect yourself from unwanted infections, have your partner wear a condom.  The Takeaway  A woman’s ovulation cycles can vary, so it’s statistically possible you could become pregnant while on your period. While pregnancy is less likely in the earlier days of your period, the chances increase in the later days.  If you’re trying to become pregnant and haven’t conceived after a year or more of having unprotected sex, contact your doctor. They can recommend methods of tracking your ovulation, as well as fertility experts. They can provide testing and treatments that will help you increase your chances of conception.

Build Number: 12823 Newsletter Can You Get Your Period and Still Be Pregnant? Medically reviewed by Kimberly Dishman, MSN, WHNP-BC, RNC-OB on  October 31, 2016 — Written by Kristeen Cherney Are you pregnant? Early pregnancy causes Late pregnancy causes Bottom line Intro  No. Despite all of the claims out there, it isn’t possible to have a period while you’re pregnant. During early pregnancy, you might experience “spotting,” which is usually light pink or dark brown in color. As a rule of thumb, the American Pregnancy Association states: “If you’re bleeding enough to fill pads and tampons, then this would be a good indication that you’re probably not pregnant.”  Are you pregnant? Period
vs. pregnancy  Your period is a monthly event that occurs in lieu of an egg becoming fertilized. Eggs are released once a month from the ovary. When they aren’t fertilized, the egg travels out of the uterus and sheds through the vagina. Bleeding during a “normal” period often starts off light, then gets heavier and darker red. It also lightens in color and quantity toward the end of the cycle.  The differences between menstruation and being pregnant are supposed to be clear-cut: Once you’re pregnant, you don’t get periods anymore. Unfortunately, it isn’t always so obvious. Some women claim they’ve gotten periods while pregnant. Fueling some of the inquiries in the “periods while pregnant” conspiracy are social media, blogs, and even television shows like “I Didn’t Know I Was Pregnant .”  Bleeding isn’t necessarily a sign of something bad. Many women go on to have healthy babies after experiencing spotting during their first trimester. If you do bleed during pregnancy, it’s related to something else other than regular menstruation.  After all, periods only happen when you’re not pregnant. Learn about the different types of bleeding during pregnancy and when you need to call your OB-GYN.  Early pregnancy causes Causes
of bleeding during the first trimester  Between 25 and 30 percent of women spot during early pregnancy. Some of the causes are:  implantation bleeding changes in the cervix infection molar pregnancy (abnormal mass fertilizes instead of a fetus) ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside of the uterus) early signs of a miscarriage  Implantation bleeding  This happens in the earliest stages of pregnancy. At this point, you likely haven’t even gotten a pregnancy test yet. This type of bleeding occurs when the fertilized egg implants into the uterus, usually around the time your period would be expected. Implantation bleeding is sometimes mistaken by pregnant women as a period, though the bleeding is usually light or spotting.  Shortly after pregnancy, you might also experience spotting from cervical changes. Unless there’s an infection, this isn’t often cause for concern.  Other causes  Other types of early bleeding that can indicate an emergency medical issue include:  infections ectopic pregnancy molar pregnancy miscarriage  These can also be accompanied by:  severe cramps or abdominal pain back pain faintness or losing consciousness fatigue shoulder pain fever vaginal discharge changes uncontrollable nausea and vomiting  The bleeding is also much heavier, unlike spotting. It’s more like a normal period.  Late pregnancy causes Causes
of bleeding during second and third trimesters  Bleeding beyond the first trimester is usually a sign that something is wrong. Regardless of whether bleeding during the second and third trimester is light or heavy, with or without any other symptoms, you need to call your doctor for an emergency visit.  Common causes of bleeding during the rest of pregnancy include:  term or preterm labor or cervical dilation miscarriage placenta previa placental abruption uterine rupture (rare) vasa previa (rare)  Preterm labor  This refers to any birth that happens before 37 weeks. Before preterm labor, some women experience symptoms similar to a period, as well as a large amount of mucus discharge. While cramping may also be felt, preterm labor also causes contractions. Symptoms of preterm labor might also include backache, a sensation of pressure in the vagina, and changes in discharge.  Placenta previa  This happens when the placenta is implanted low in the uterus and very close to, or covers the cervix. The bleeding varies, but there are no other symptoms. Placenta previa can hinder labor and delivery.  Placental abruption  This occurs most commonly during the last few months of pregnancy. The placenta detaches from the uterus, usually causing heavy bleeding and possibly severe stomach pain and cramping. Certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, can increase the risk for placental abruption.  Uterine rupture  A uterine rupture means that the muscle of the uterus separates or tears. This can cause uncontrolled bleeding. In the United States, it occurs most commonly in women who have delivered via cesarean delivery in the past. Though rare, this type of tear happens on old scar lines along the uterus.  Many of the conditions that happen in the latter part of pregnancy cause bleeding and other symptoms similar to a period. But, these are not really menstruation.  Bottom line Bottom
line  It’s not possible to get your period while pregnant, but many pregnant women experience similar symptoms of a period during their first trimesters. These include:  vaginal bleeding (light, and short-term) light cramping fatigue irritability lower back pain  The difference is that these symptoms are related to your body’s natural preparation methods for pregnancy. If any of the above symptoms are severe or don’t go away, and/or you’re in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, seek immediate care.  Sometimes it’s difficult to tell whether bleeding is indicative of a medical emergency or not. As a rule of thumb, if you are bleeding at any stage of pregnancy, you should call your doctor right away.  Q: What’s the earliest you can test and get a positive pregnancy result? A: Home pregnancy tests measure a level of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the urine. Urine usually has less measurable hormones than blood, so urine tests may not be as accurate early in the pregnancy. Several factors can impact the accuracy of the home urine pregnancy test: the type of test or brand, error in interpreting the results, female cycle length, and interference from another diagnosis or treatment are a few examples. The best time to take a home pregnancy test is at the time of a missed menstrual cycle. However, even on the first day after a missed period, more than a third of pregnant women will have a negative home pregnancy test result. Some women report having positive results before the date of their expected menstrual cycle, though this isn’t common.

Share          Expert Answer       Deborah Taylor  Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist     Not really. Once your body starts producing the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), your periods will stop.  However, you may be pregnant and have light bleeding at about the time that your period would have been due. This type of bleeding in early pregnancy is surprisingly common.  Early bleeding is most likely to be caused by the placenta developing. Once an embryo has implanted in your womb (uterus), the cells and tissues of the placenta start to grow. But until the placenta is established enough to become your baby's lifeline, your body does the job of supplying your growing baby with nutrients and oxygen.  By about six weeks of pregnancy, the placenta is big and complex enough to take over the job of nourishing your baby. It's at this point that you may get some light bleeding.  It’s only natural to be worried if you're pregnant and you have spotting or bleeding . Tell your doctor or midwife , just in case.  Sadly, bleeding can sometimes be the first sign of a miscarriage . Bleeding from a miscarriage can sometimes feel like a period, but it's usually heavier, with more painful tummy cramps.   Ectopic pregnancy is another type of worrying bleeding, when the embryo implants in a fallopian tube instead of the womb. Ectopic pregnancy usually causes dark or watery bleeding, and sharp pains in your lower tummy, especially on one side. It needs swift treatment, so call your doctor if you have these symptoms.  Although it’s most likely that your bleeding is nothing to worry about, your midwife may suggest checks, to make sure your pregnancy is going well.  If you’re only just pregnant, your midwife may offer a blood test to check your hormone levels, or she may refer you to an early pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU) for an early scan .

In fact one of the simplest ways to tell that you are pregnant is by noting the number of missed periods that you have during the early stages of the pregnancy. However, it is not uncommon for some women to go through a light spotting that is similar to a period during their pregnancy. If you are one of these women, do not fear as this is more common than you think. Women of all ages and from all walks of life have reportedly had several bouts of bleeding and spotting while pregnant, so before you jump to any conclusions, stay calm and consult a doctor for a proper check up.         How Often Does This Happen?  While some women have reports of spotting and slight bleeding well into their second and third trimesters, many women tend to have this problem at the early stages of their pregnancy. At the end of the day, it depends on the woman and how her body reacts to the pregnancy and hormonal changes.  Why Does It Happen?  1. Early Symptoms Of Pregnancy  Spotting or bleeding may indicate pregnancy. This usually happens during the very early stages of the first trimester when you may not even realize that you are pregnant. Besides bloating, breast tenderness and morning sickness, spotting may be an indication that you are pregnant, so take a pregnancy test or visit your doctor to be sure.         2. Implantation Bleeding  This form of bleeding happens up to two weeks after conception. This is when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. It usually takes place around the same time that you can expect your period. Do not worry because this is completely normal and does not require any form of treatment or medication. However, you should know that implantation bleeding is a lot lighter than regular menstruation so if you experience heavy bleeding, seek the advice of a doctor.  3. Breakthrough Bleeding  This form of bleeding can be attributed to hormonal changes. What happens is that pregnancy hormones cover up your regular menstruation cycle. One out of five women will experience breakthrough bleeding so this is relatively normal. This usually happens within the first trimester of the pregnancy and in some cases may drag on into the second trimester. Like implantation bleeding, this will happen around the same time that your menstruation is supposed to arrive. It will only last a couple of days and can be likened to light spotting. Anything too heavy should be taken seriously and that is when you need to see a doctor.  4. Rectal Bleeding  Some pregnant women mistake rectal bleeding for their period. Do not worry if you find blood on your toilet paper or on your underwear. Rectal bleeding can be caused by hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids happen when the blood vessels in and around the anus become swollen. These swollen veins may bleed when you have a bowel movement or wipe too hard. This is common during pregnancy especially during the third trimester. One way to combat this is to consume foods that will keep constipation away like whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables. You should also consume plenty of water and do regular exercise. Many women find yoga to be helpful as it is not too strenuous and encourages physical and mental relaxation. You should also consider switching to a softer toilet paper or use facial tissues instead.         5. Hormonal Changes  A reason why you may menstruate is because of your progesterone level. When you are pregnant, your progesterone level will rise high enough to the point that it will suppress your period. However in some cases, your progesterone may not rise up high enough to completely suppress it, especially during the early stages of your pregnancy. This is when bleeding will occur.  6. Ectopic Pregnancy  An ectopic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg gets implanted outside of the uterus, most often within the fallopian tube. Although this is rather uncommon, it happens to one out of 60 women and the symptoms include vaginal bleeding, cramping and pains in the abdominal area. Your doctor will tell you what to do next.  7. Infection or Growth  Infection in the pelvic area or a urinary tract infection may cause you to bleed during your pregnancy. Another reason may be because of an inflamed cervix or growths in the area. The only way to determine if you have these problems is to consult your doctor. He or she will then conduct a series of tests to get a better understanding of what is going on and will aptly advice you on what to do next.  8. Miscarriage  This is by far the worst case scenario. Vaginal bleeding alone does not mean that you are having a miscarriage . Only when the bleeding is coupled with severe cramping in the lower stomach and when you notice tissue being released from the vagina should you be worried. Immediately head to the hospital if you have all the symptoms. This is often the body’s way of telling you that it is an unhealthy pregnancy and that it cannot sustain it to the full term.  9. Labor  Spotting or bleeding that mimics your period may be a sign of early labor. Up to several weeks before your due date, your mucus plug may pass. This mucus will comprise of some blood which could lead you to mistake it for your period. This is usually accompanied by vaginal discharge. This occurrence is also known as pre-term labor and is very common.       Keep in mind that no matter what the cause is, bleeding during your pregnancy should be much lighter than your usual menstruation volume. If you experience heavy bleeding and cramps, seek medical attention immediately as this may be a sign of a miscarriage or a severe problem with either you or the fetus.
