This is one death every 51 minutes. 1 The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion. 2  Thankfully, there are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from alcohol-impaired driving.   The Problem Risk Factors BAC Effects Prevention Additional Resources The Problem How big is the problem?  In 2015, 10,265 people died in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for nearly one-third (29%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. 1  Of the 1, 1,132 traffic deaths among children ages 0 to 14 years in 2015, 209 (16%) involved an alcohol-impaired driver. 1  In 2015, nearly 1.1 million drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. 3 That’s one percent of the 111 million self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaired driving among U.S. adults each year. 4  Drugs other than alcohol (legal and illegal) are involved in about 16% of motor vehicle crashes. 5  Marijuana use is increasing 6 and 13% of nighttime, weekend drivers have marijuana in their system. 7  Marijuana users were about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers with no evidence of marijuana use, however other factors – such as age and gender – may account for the increased crash risk among marijuana users. 5  Annual Self-reported Alcohol-impaired Driving Episodes among U.S. Adults, 1993–2014  Source: CDC. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 1993–2014. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss Note: The annual estimated alcohol-impaired driving episodes were calculated using BRFSS respondents’ answers to this question: “During the past 30 days, how many times have you driven when you’ve had perhaps too much to drink?” Annual estimates per respondent were calculated by multiplying the reported episodes during the preceding 30 days by 12. These numbers were summed to obtain the annual national estimates (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a2.htm ). Risk Factors Who is most at risk?  Young people:  At all levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC), the risk of being involved in a crash is greater for young people than for older people. 8  Among drivers with BAC levels of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes in 2015, nearly three in 10 were between 21 and 24 years of age (28%). The next two largest groups were ages 25 to 34 (27%) and 35 to 44 (23%). 1  Motorcyclists:  Among motorcyclists killed in fatal crashes in 2015, 27% had BACs of 0.08% or greater. 1  Motorcyclists ages 35-39 have the highest percentage of deaths with BACs of 0.08% or greater (37% in 2015). 9  Drivers with prior driving while impaired (DWI) convictions:  Drivers with a BAC of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes were 4.5 times more likely to have a prior conviction for DWI than were drivers with no alcohol in their system. (9% and 2%, respectively). 1  BAC Effects What are the effects of blood alcohol concentration (BAC)?  Information in this table shows the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at which the effect usually is first observed.  Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)*  Typical Effects  Predictable Effects on Driving  .02% About 2 alcoholic drinks**   Some loss of judgment  Relaxation  Slight body warmth  Altered mood    Decline in visual functions (rapid tracking of a moving target)  Decline in ability to perform two tasks at the same time (divided attention)   .05% About 3 alcoholic drinks**   Exaggerated behavior  May have loss of small-muscle control (e.g., focusing your eyes)  Impaired judgment  Usually good feeling  Lowered alertness  Release of inhibition    Reduced coordination  Reduced ability to track moving objects  Difficulty steering  Reduced response to emergency driving situations   .08% About 4 alcoholic drinks**   Muscle coordination becomes poor (e.g., balance, speech, vision, reaction time, and hearing)  Harder to detect danger  Judgment, self-control, reasoning, and memory are impaired    Concentration  Short-term memory loss  Speed control  Reduced information processing capability (e.g., signal detection, visual search)  Impaired perception   .10% About 5 alcoholic drinks**   Clear deterioration of reaction time and control  Slurred speech, poor coordination, and slowed thinking    Reduced ability to maintain lane position and brake appropriately   .15% About 7 alcoholic drinks**   Far less muscle control than normal  Vomiting may occur (unless this level is reached slowly or a person has developed a tolerance for alcohol)  Major loss of balance    Substantial impairment in vehicle control, attention to driving task, and in necessary visual and auditory information processing    *Blood Alcohol Concentration Measurement  The number of drinks listed represents the approximate amount of alcohol that a 160-pound man would need to drink in one hour to reach the listed BAC in each category.  **A Standard Drink Size in the United States  A standard drink is equal to 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in  12-ounces of beer (5% alcohol content)  8-ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content)  5-ounces of wine (12% alcohol content)  1.5-ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey)   Adapted from The ABCs of BAC , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2005, and How to Control Your Drinking, WR Miller and RF Munoz, University of New Mexico, 1982. Prevention How can deaths and injuries from impaired driving be prevented?  Effective measures include:  Actively enforcing existing 0.08% BAC laws, minimum legal drinking age laws, and zero tolerance laws for drivers younger than 21 years old in all states. 4,10  Requiring ignition interlocks for all offenders, including first-time offenders 11  Using sobriety checkpoints . 12  Putting health promotion efforts into practice that influence economic, organizational, policy, and school/community action. 13,14  Using community-based approaches to alcohol control and DWI prevention. 10,14,15  Requiring mandatory substance abuse assessment and treatment, if needed, for DWI offenders. 16  Raising the unit price of alcohol by increasing taxes. 17  Areas for continued research:  Reducing the illegal BAC threshold  to 0.05%. 18-22  Mandatory blood alcohol testing when traffic crashes result in injury. 23  Does marijuana impair driving? How and at what level?  Does marijuana use increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes?  What safety steps can individuals take?  Whenever your social plans involve alcohol and/or drugs, make plans so that you don’t have to drive while impaired. For example:  Before drinking, designate a non-drinking driver when with a group.  Don’t let your friends drive impaired.  If you have been drinking or using drugs, get a ride home or call a taxi.  If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, remind your guests to plan ahead and designate their sober driver; offer alcohol-free beverages, and make sure all guests leave with a sober driver.

But when the number of alcohol impaired drivers increases, the odds skyrocket. Research into periods when motorists are most vulnerable to accidents involving alcohol-impaired drivers offers an instructive road map for avoiding those times when driving risks are the greatest.  According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), between 2001 and 2005, 36 fatalities occurred per day on average in the United States as a result of crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver. At certain times of the year, such as summers and holidays, those numbers rose dramatically. During the Christmas period, for example, an average of 45 fatalities involving an alcohol-impaired driver occurred each day, and soared to 54 per day over the New Year’s holiday. All these numbers would almost certainly be lower if breathalyzer use were more widespread.  The summer season usually offers the best weather and driving conditions of the year – dry roads, excellent visibility, and longer daylight hours. But the seasonal benefits can be negated by other factors. According to the NHTSA, a higher volume of holiday travelers, including a significantly higher number of alcohol-impaired drivers, cause nearly twice the number of automotive deaths during summer months than during the rest of the year combined.  “100 Deadliest Days” for Teens  The period between Memorial Day and Labor Day – summer vacation for most students – has been called "The 100 Deadliest Days" for teen drivers. Nine of the 10 deadliest days for youth on U.S. highways fall between May and August. One reason is that teens are drinking are younger ages.  Nine of the 10 deadliest days for youth on U.S. highways fall between May and August.  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an estimated 5.8% of teens ages 16 and 17, and 15.1% of 18 to 20 year olds reported driving under the influence of alcohol in 2010. The U.S. Department of Transportation found that a total of 3,115 teens ages 13-19 died in motor vehicle crashes that year, and about 2 out of 3 fatalities were males.  Too much free time and too little driving experience also risk for teenagers. In addition, they are more likely to engage in “distracted driving” behavior, which describes activities that can endanger the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Examples of distracted driving include texting, using a cell phone, or grooming while driving a motor vehicle.  Most Dangerous Holidays  During the holidays, the number of travelers on our nation’s roads peaks as friends and family come together to celebrate. As a result of holiday parties and gatherings, more drivers are impaired by alcohol, too. Unfortunately, fatalities resulting from accidents involving alcohol-impaired drivers have become so predictable that many state highway patrol departments now issue fatality estimates, which usually prove to be all too accurate.  Lurking among the “100 Deadliest Days” of summer is the deadliest day of them all – the Fourth of July holiday. The IIHS studied deaths resulting from auto accidents from 2005 to 2009 and ranked the July 4 as the deadliest day of the year, with 144 driving-related fatalities on average. Teens accounted for nearly 10% of the fatalities.  The most traveled holiday period of the year is Thanksgiving weekend, and DUI arrests are at their highest between Thanksgiving and the end of New Year’s weekend. Thanksgiving Eve is even referred to as “Black Wednesday,” as it may be the busiest night of the year for bars. Social binge drinking (consumption of a high volume of alcohol in a short period of time) is also common at this time of year.  During the Christmas and New Year period, the average number of fatalities involving an alcohol-impaired driver rose 34%. This numbers would almost certainly be lower if breathalyzer use were more widespread.  The U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that 40% of traffic-related deaths during Christmas and New Year's involve drunk drivers -- a 12% increase over the rest of the month of December. According to the NHTSA, 2,597 people lost their lives due to motor vehicle traffic crashes during December 2010. The NHTSA also found that an average of 36 fatalities occurred each day in the U.S. 2001 and 2005 as a result of crashes involving an alcohol impaired driver. That number increased to 45 per day during the 3-day Christmas period and jumped to 54 per day over New Year’s holiday period.  Predictably, driving danger is higher than average during other holiday periods, too. According to the NHTSA, during Labor Day weekend in 2010, 147 people in the U.S. were killed as a result of drunk driving, which represented 36% of all highway fatalities during that period.  Other Dangerous Days and Times  The IIHS found that the second deadliest day after July 4 was September 2, followed by August 13, July 15, May 20, and November 11. Perhaps surprisingly, New Year's Eve ranked 7th, with 130 average fatalities.  IIHS also discovered that seven of the 25 deadliest days in the U.S. occurred during August, which made it the deadliest month on the road. September and July rank as the second and third deadliest months, according to the NHTSA, and March had the fewest auto fatalities.  Many of the deadliest days occur when people celebrate special occasions and events, such as Cinco de Mayo or the Super Bowl. For example, a NHTSA study found that alcohol-related crashes claimed a life every 51 minutes on St. Patrick’s Day in 2010, accounting for 32% of all fatalities that occurred that day.  The NHTSA reports that most accidents occur during "rush hour," between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  And according to the NHTSA, Saturday is the most dangerous day of the week to drive, primarily because there are more cars – and more drunk drivers – on the road than any other day. According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, 31% of fatal drunk-driving accidents occur on the weekend, and the highest number of drunk drivers is on the road between midnight and 3 a.m. Fatal crashes are also four times higher at night than during the day.  Dangerous Days to Walk  While New Year’s Day might not be the most dangerous day to drive, it’s probably the most dangerous day to walk. According to a 2005 article in the journal Injury Prevention, more pedestrian deaths occur on New Year's Day than any other day, including Halloween.  Pedestrian deaths are also more likely to occur on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, when nearly half (49%) of all pedestrian fatalities occurred. Alcohol involvement — for driver or pedestrian — was reported in nearly half of all traffic crashes resulting in pedestrian deaths. And in one-third of pedestrian fatalities, the pedestrian was intoxicated.  The most traveled holiday period of the year is Thanksgiving weekend. DUI arrests are at their highest between Thanksgiving and the end of New Year’s weekend.  In 2008, 69,000 pedestrians were injured in traffic crashes and 4,378 were killed, according to the CDC. One pedestrian was injured every eight minutes and one was killed every two hours. Thirty-eight percent pedestrian fatalities for those under age 16 occurred between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Your Deadliest Days to Drive  It’s easy to calculate your own Most Dangerous Days to Drive. Anytime you consume alcohol and drive, you increase your risk of being in a car accident. Highway patrol departments are more familiar with the data than you. If you plan to drink during periods when driving dangers are elevated, be aware that the highway patrol is on alert, and that are determined to get intoxicated drivers off the highways.

Information about the number and cost of impaired driving incidents and the cost saving from prevention strategies has not always been available or accessible in an easy-to-use format.  The National Public Services Research Institute developed state-specific data on impaired driving for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The series of State Cost Fact Sheets is available only on NHTSA's website. These fact sheets show the cost of impaired driving for a particular state and estimate the savings a state could realize if it implemented certain impaired driving countermeasures. There is also a U.S. Cost Fact Sheet that lists the national costs.  A Methods and Definitions Fact Sheet accompanies the individual state fact sheets. It describes how the costs and savings estimates were calculated and gives the references citations. The Methods pages should always accompany the U.S. and state fact sheets.  The State Cost Fact Sheet User's Guide goes into more detail about state-level estimates and describes how they can be used to educate the public about the costs of impaired driving. The cost estimates give an index of the magnitude of the impaired driving problem, and help establish how high a priority impaired driving should be compared to the overall costs of other types of problems. They identify types of alcohol-related crashes that merit immediate attention and project net savings from implementing various impaired driving countermeasures.  HOW TO OBTAIN  These are available only on NHTSA's website, http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/traffic_tech/2000/www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/alcohol/facts.htm Most public libraries can provide Internet access.   Sample of the U.S. Fact Sheet  Incidence of Impaired Driving  For one of every 140 miles driven in the United States in 1998, a driver whose BAC exceeded the legal limit (BAC .10) sat behind the wheel. Police in the United States report 438,000 crashes involving a driver or pedestrian with a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Formulas developed by NHTSA were used to estimate the number of alcohol- related crashes where alcohol involvement is not reported by the police. An estimated total of 1,049,900 crashes in the United States involved alcohol. These crashes killed 15,935 people and injured an estimated 821,000 more. Of the nonfatal injuries, 630,000 were police-reported and only these are detailed in the state cost fact sheets.  Impaired Driving by Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)  In 1998, the United States drivers with:   BACs of .10 and above were involved in an estimated 999,000 crashes that killed 15,530 and injured 719,000  BACs between .08-.09 were involved in an estimated 17,200 crashes that killed 993 and injured 32,000  Positive BACs below .08 were involved in an estimated 33,700 crashes that killed 2,412 and injured 70,000   Costs  Alcohol is a factor in 35% of the United States crashes. Alcohol-related crashes in the United States cost the public more than $110 billion in 1998, including more than $40 billion in monetary costs and almost $70 billion in quality of life losses. Alcohol-related crashes are deadlier and more serious than other crashes. People other than the drinking driver paid $51 billion of the alcohol-related crash bill.  Costs Per Alcohol-Related Injury  The average alcohol-related fatality in the United States cost $3.2 million: $1.2 million in monetary costs and $2 million in quality of life losses. The estimated cost per injured survivor of an alcohol-related crash averaged $79,000: $36,000 in monetary costs and $43,000 in quality of life losses.  Costs Per Mile Driven  Crash costs in the United States averaged:   $5.80 per mile driven at BACs of .10 and above  $2.50 per mile driven at BACs between .08-.09  $0.10 per mile driven at BACs of .00   Costs Per Drink  The societal costs of alcohol-related crashes in the United States averaged $0.80 per drink consumed. People other than the drinking driver paid $0.40 per drink.  Impact on Auto Insurance Rates  Alcohol-related crashes accounted for an estimated 16% of the $127 billion in U.S. auto insurance payments. Reducing alcohol-related crashes by 10% would save $3 billion in claims payments and loss adjustment expenses.  Prevention Savings  The United States already has many important impaired driving laws. However, a number of additional strategies can be used to mitigate the harm from impaired driving.   Enforcing Serving Intoxicated Patrons Law: Using undercover police officers to enforce the state laws against serving alcohol to intoxicated bar and restaurant patrons would reduce alcohol-related crash fatalities by an estimated 11%. It would cost $0.30 per licensed driver and save $30 per licensed driver.  Administrative License Revocation: Laws that allow police or driver licensing authorities to revoke a driver's license swiftly and automatically for refusing or failing a BAC test would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by 6.5% and save an estimated $44,000 per driver sanctioned. The value of the driver's lost mobility is the large majority of the $2,300 cost per driver sanctioned. Reinstatement fees assessed to offenders more than cover start-up and operating costs.    .08 BAC Law: Lowering driver BAC limits to .08 would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by 8% and save an estimated $2 per licensed driver. The value of mobility losses and alcohol sales reductions resulting from the   law are the large majority of the $0.20 cost per licensed driver.   Graduated Licensing: Graduated licensing would impose a nighttime driving restriction or passenger limits for young novice drivers. Graduated licensing with a midnight curfew would reduce youth fatalities by 5-8% and total alcohol-related fatalities by 2%. It would save an estimated $600 per youthful driver. The value of the mobility lost by youth is the large majority of the $60 cost per youthful driver.  Ignition Interlock: Breath-testing ignition interlocks are designed to prevent anyone with a BAC above the legal limit from starting or driving a car. Attaching an interlock to a car for a year after its operator is convicted of driving while intoxicated would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by an estimated 7%-12% and save $10,200 per vehicle equipped. Including the value of mobility lost, as well as equipment and case management costs, interlock costs would total $1,100 per vehicle. Existing programs typically recover their equipment and case management costs from sanctioned drivers.  Sobriety Checkpoint Program: Intensive enforcement of state BAC limits with highly visible sobriety checkpoints would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by at least 15% and save $50,700 per checkpoint. Including costs of travel delay and the value of mobility losses by impaired drivers apprehended and sanctioned, the costs of conducting a checkpoint would average $7,600 including police resources.  Primary Belt Law: Primary belt laws allow law enforcement to stop and ticket a driver for non-use of a safety belt without requiring the driver to be cited for or have committed another offense. Unbelted drivers account for 75% of impaired driving fatalities. Primary belt laws can reduce alcohol-related fatalities in the United States by approximately 10%. The laws would save $200 per licensed driver. If enforced with frequent belt-use checkpoints, the value of temporary discomfort experienced by some new belt wearers and travel delay costs at checkpoints would be the large majority of the law's $3.50 cost per licensed driver.

In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile.  Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving.  Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. We hope with a little information, you'll make the right decision when you're on the road.  General Cell Phone Statistics  Note: These are the most recent statistics available   The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.  Nearly 330,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.  1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.  Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.  Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.  Texting while driving causes a 400% increase in time spent with eyes off the road.  Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.  94% of drivers support a ban on texting while driving.  74% of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use.   Teen Driver Cell Phone Statistics   According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway.  21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones.  Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone.  A teen driver with only one additional passenger doubles the risk of getting into a fatal car accident. With two or more passengers, they are 5x as likely.   2013 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics   In 2013, 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes.  About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver.  In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.   2012 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics   In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction-related crashes.  About 421,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver.  In 2012, 11% of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.  One-fourth of teenagers respond to at least one text message every time they drive and 20% of teens and 10% of parents report having multi-text message conversations while driving.   2012 National Survey on Distracted Driving Attitudes and Behaviors   Nearly half (48%) of drivers admit to answering their cell phones while driving.  Of those who answered their phones while driving, 58% of drivers continued to drive while talking on the phone .  In the survey, 24% of drivers reported that they are willing to make a phone call while driving.  One in 10 drivers surveyed said that, at least sometimes, they send text messages or emails while driving.  Of the drivers surveyed, 14% said they read text messages or emails while driving .  A majority of respondents supported laws that banned talking on cell phones, texting, or emailing while driving.   2012 Texting Pedestrian Study  Researchers from the University of Washington monitored 20 of Seattle's busiest intersections and observed the following:   Pedestrians who text are 4x less likely to look before crossing the street, cross in crosswalks, or obey traffic signals.  They also found that texting pedestrians take an average of two seconds longer to cross the street.   For statistics from 2011 and before, check out our Past Cell Phone and Driving Statistics .

I've already written about how the data show that stoned driving is a lot safer than drunk driving . But one of the reports also quantifies the increase in crash risk as a driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) increases, and boy is it something.      In all 50 states, the legal threshold for driving under the influence falls at 0.08% BAC . But as you can see from this chart, the risk of a car crash starts rising at BAC thresholds well below that. At a BAC of 0.05 -- completely street-legal -- your odds of wrecking your car have increased 100 percent versus someone who hasn't drunk at all. At 0.08, your crash odds have roughly tripled.  Depending on your weight and gender, it doesn't take many drinks to reach those BAC thresholds . If you're a 160-pound man, it takes just two drinks in an hour to reach a BAC of 0.05. If you're a 120-pound woman, 2 drinks will land you in 0.08 territory.  For that 160-pound man, five drinks in an hour leads to a BAC of .12 and an elevated crash risk of 682 percent (no, that figure's not missing any decimals).  These numbers underscore the arbitrariness of the 0.08 DUI threshold -- why do we accept a doubled risk of crash at 0.05 BAC, but not a triple risk? And why do we severely punish stoned driving at THC thresholds that correspond to no increased risk of crash at all ?                     Christopher Ingraham writes about politics, drug policy and all things data. He previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center.

Despite all the warnings, public awareness and educational programs, stiffer penalties for violations, people will still get behind the wheel of their vehicles while intoxicated.         While drunk driving numbers have decreased in the past couple of decades for youths and teens, they are still at risk whether they are the drivers or not. Motor vehicle wrecks are the leading cause of death in the United States for persons under age 24, whether as the driver or the passenger, with almost half involving alcohol as a factor in the crash. How Dangerous Is Drinking and Driving? A driver with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10 or greater is seven times more likely to be involved in a fatal motor vehicle crash than is a driver who has not consumed alcoholic beverages, and a driver with an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or greater is about 25 times more likely. Basically, the more you drink, the more likely you are to have an accident—and a fatal one. The same applies for the likelihood of having any vehicle accident, fatal or otherwise. Here are the cold, hard facts. More Likely to Have a Crash A 160-pound person drinking two 12-ounce beers within an hour would probably have a BAC of 0.02, well below the legal limits of driving under the influence, but 1.4 times more likely to have an accident than someone who is sober.   One of the problems with setting the legal limit for "drunk driving" at a blood-alcohol content level of 0.08 is it sends the message that if you are not yet legally drunk, you are therefore okay to drive. Impairment Begins Below 0.08 BAC The problem lies in the fact that impairment begins long before you reach the 0.08 level.         Scientific research shows explicitly that some of the skills that you need to drive safely begin to deteriorate even at the 0.02 blood-alcohol level. Experiments have shown that drivers at the 0.02 level experience a decline in visual functions—their ability to track a moving object—and experience a decline in the ability to perform two tasks at the same time. Two More Beers? If you had those first two beers that raised your BAC to 0.08 and now you drink two more beers, your likelihood of an accident goes up almost tenfold. At 0.08 BAC, a driver is 11 times more likely than the non-drinking driver to be involved in a crash. As the amount of alcohol in the driver's system rises mathematically on the BAC scale , the likelihood of a traffic accident multiples . Now add two more beers to your total, you are up to having consumed a six-pack. The likelihood of having an accident is now 48 times higher than the abstainer and the driver has just now passed the 0.10 BAC level. Two more beers: Hey, you've already had a six-pack, two more couldn't hurt, right? Except two more beers could put your BAC close to 0.15 at which point you are 380 times more likely to have an accident. Play It Smart Play it smart during weekends and holidays.         If you plan to party away from home—and this includes on the water—be sure to appoint a designated driver for the car or operator of the boat. Whatever you do, don't get behind the wheel if you've been drinking. Consider calling a cab or using a rideshare app to get yourself and your loved ones home safely and protect every else on the road. Better yet, if you are going to be drinking away from home, use those options so you don't have a car handy you'll be tempted to drive when your judgment is impaired by alcohol.

This is one death every 51 minutes. 1 The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion. 2  Thankfully, there are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from alcohol-impaired driving.   The Problem Risk Factors BAC Effects Prevention Additional Resources The Problem How big is the problem?  In 2015, 10,265 people died in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for nearly one-third (29%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. 1  Of the 1, 1,132 traffic deaths among children ages 0 to 14 years in 2015, 209 (16%) involved an alcohol-impaired driver. 1  In 2015, nearly 1.1 million drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. 3 That’s one percent of the 111 million self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaired driving among U.S. adults each year. 4  Drugs other than alcohol (legal and illegal) are involved in about 16% of motor vehicle crashes. 5  Marijuana use is increasing 6 and 13% of nighttime, weekend drivers have marijuana in their system. 7  Marijuana users were about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers with no evidence of marijuana use, however other factors – such as age and gender – may account for the increased crash risk among marijuana users. 5  Annual Self-reported Alcohol-impaired Driving Episodes among U.S. Adults, 1993–2014  Source: CDC. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 1993–2014. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss Note: The annual estimated alcohol-impaired driving episodes were calculated using BRFSS respondents’ answers to this question: “During the past 30 days, how many times have you driven when you’ve had perhaps too much to drink?” Annual estimates per respondent were calculated by multiplying the reported episodes during the preceding 30 days by 12. These numbers were summed to obtain the annual national estimates (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a2.htm ). Risk Factors Who is most at risk?  Young people:  At all levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC), the risk of being involved in a crash is greater for young people than for older people. 8  Among drivers with BAC levels of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes in 2015, nearly three in 10 were between 21 and 24 years of age (28%). The next two largest groups were ages 25 to 34 (27%) and 35 to 44 (23%). 1  Motorcyclists:  Among motorcyclists killed in fatal crashes in 2015, 27% had BACs of 0.08% or greater. 1  Motorcyclists ages 35-39 have the highest percentage of deaths with BACs of 0.08% or greater (37% in 2015). 9  Drivers with prior driving while impaired (DWI) convictions:  Drivers with a BAC of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes were 4.5 times more likely to have a prior conviction for DWI than were drivers with no alcohol in their system. (9% and 2%, respectively). 1  BAC Effects What are the effects of blood alcohol concentration (BAC)?  Information in this table shows the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at which the effect usually is first observed.  Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)*  Typical Effects  Predictable Effects on Driving  .02% About 2 alcoholic drinks**   Some loss of judgment  Relaxation  Slight body warmth  Altered mood    Decline in visual functions (rapid tracking of a moving target)  Decline in ability to perform two tasks at the same time (divided attention)   .05% About 3 alcoholic drinks**   Exaggerated behavior  May have loss of small-muscle control (e.g., focusing your eyes)  Impaired judgment  Usually good feeling  Lowered alertness  Release of inhibition    Reduced coordination  Reduced ability to track moving objects  Difficulty steering  Reduced response to emergency driving situations   .08% About 4 alcoholic drinks**   Muscle coordination becomes poor (e.g., balance, speech, vision, reaction time, and hearing)  Harder to detect danger  Judgment, self-control, reasoning, and memory are impaired    Concentration  Short-term memory loss  Speed control  Reduced information processing capability (e.g., signal detection, visual search)  Impaired perception   .10% About 5 alcoholic drinks**   Clear deterioration of reaction time and control  Slurred speech, poor coordination, and slowed thinking    Reduced ability to maintain lane position and brake appropriately   .15% About 7 alcoholic drinks**   Far less muscle control than normal  Vomiting may occur (unless this level is reached slowly or a person has developed a tolerance for alcohol)  Major loss of balance    Substantial impairment in vehicle control, attention to driving task, and in necessary visual and auditory information processing    *Blood Alcohol Concentration Measurement  The number of drinks listed represents the approximate amount of alcohol that a 160-pound man would need to drink in one hour to reach the listed BAC in each category.  **A Standard Drink Size in the United States  A standard drink is equal to 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in  12-ounces of beer (5% alcohol content)  8-ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content)  5-ounces of wine (12% alcohol content)  1.5-ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey)   Adapted from The ABCs of BAC , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2005, and How to Control Your Drinking, WR Miller and RF Munoz, University of New Mexico, 1982. Prevention How can deaths and injuries from impaired driving be prevented?  Effective measures include:  Actively enforcing existing 0.08% BAC laws, minimum legal drinking age laws, and zero tolerance laws for drivers younger than 21 years old in all states. 4,10  Requiring ignition interlocks for all offenders, including first-time offenders 11  Using sobriety checkpoints . 12  Putting health promotion efforts into practice that influence economic, organizational, policy, and school/community action. 13,14  Using community-based approaches to alcohol control and DWI prevention. 10,14,15  Requiring mandatory substance abuse assessment and treatment, if needed, for DWI offenders. 16  Raising the unit price of alcohol by increasing taxes. 17  Areas for continued research:  Reducing the illegal BAC threshold  to 0.05%. 18-22  Mandatory blood alcohol testing when traffic crashes result in injury. 23  Does marijuana impair driving? How and at what level?  Does marijuana use increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes?  What safety steps can individuals take?  Whenever your social plans involve alcohol and/or drugs, make plans so that you don’t have to drive while impaired. For example:  Before drinking, designate a non-drinking driver when with a group.  Don’t let your friends drive impaired.  If you have been drinking or using drugs, get a ride home or call a taxi.  If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, remind your guests to plan ahead and designate their sober driver; offer alcohol-free beverages, and make sure all guests leave with a sober driver.

View and download data , and identify strategies to help keep people safe on the road – every day.  About one in three traffic deaths in the United States involve a driver with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or higher. Drivers with a BAC of 0.08% or higher (i.e., drunk drivers) are considered alcohol-impaired by law. Thanks to dedicated efforts, rates of drunk driving and alcohol-related fatal crashes have gone down in recent years. Still, drunk drivers got behind the wheel about 121 million times in 2012.

Brewer RD 1 , Morris PD , Cole TB , Watkins S , Patetta MJ , Popkin C . Author information 1 Division of Field Epidemiology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30341. Abstract BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that people who drive while intoxicated by alcohol may do so repeatedly. We hypothesized that persons arrested for driving while impaired might be at increased risk for death in an alcohol-related motor vehicle crash. To evaluate this possibility, we studied the deaths of drivers in alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents in North Carolina over a 10-year period. METHODS: We compared drivers who died in motor vehicle crashes from 1980 through 1989 and who had blood alcohol concentrations of at least 20 mg per deciliter (4.3 mmol per liter), referred to as the case drivers, with those who died in crashes but had blood alcohol concentrations below 20 mg per deciliter, referred to as the control drivers. We identified case drivers and control drivers through the state Medical Examiner System. We then searched North Carolina driver-history files for the five years before each death to identify arrests for driving while impaired. RESULTS: We linked a total of 1646 case drivers and 1474 control drivers to their driver-history files. Case drivers were more likely than control drivers to have been arrested for driving while impaired (26 percent vs. 3 percent). After we controlled for potential confounding variables, case drivers 21 to 34 years of age were 4.3 times more likely (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 6.8) than control drivers to have been arrested for driving while impaired; case drivers 35 years of age or older were 11.7 times more likely (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 20.1). The strength of the association appeared to increase with the number of prior arrests. Case drivers were also more likely than the general population of currently licensed drivers to have been arrested. CONCLUSIONS: Arrests for driving while impaired substantially increase the risk of eventual death in an alcohol-related crash. Aggressive intervention in the cases of people arrested for driving while impaired may decrease the likelihood of a future fatal alcohol-related crash. Comment in Alcohol-related automobile crashes.

Credit: iStock     Drunks are prone to injury, be it from a rooftop fall, a barroom fight or an oversight while juggling. But new research suggests that once an injury has occurred, the same substance that leads drinkers to folly may help save them from its consequences.  The results of a study from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) show that not only does an appreciable blood-alcohol level seem to increase a trauma victim's chances of survival after being admitted to a hospital, but that the drunker a victim is, the more likely he or she is to survive.  "After an injury, if you are intoxicated there seems to be a pretty substantial protective effect," said Lee Friedman, the author of the study and an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at UIC, in  a statment issued by the school. "The more alcohol you have in your system, the more the protective effect."  Friedman's study shows a correlation between a high blood-alcohol content and an increased chance of survival after a serious injury, but it doesn't necessarily demonstrate that alcohol is the root cause of the increase.  While previous studies have examined the interactions between trauma outcome and blood-alcohol content, most have focused either on particular injuries, such as head trauma , or particular injury mechanisms, such as car accidents.  Friedman analyzed all 190,612 patients treated at Illinois' trauma centers between 1995 and 2009 who were tested for blood-alcohol content, with levels ranging from zero to 0.5 percent at time of admission. (Blood-alcohol levels above about 0.35 percent can be fatal.) He found that with the exception of burn injuries, the mortality rates of all types of traumatic injury decreased as the blood-alcohol content of victims rose. [ 7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health ]  At the upper bounds of intoxication, mortality rates were cut by nearly 50 percent, said Friedman. The effect, however, was not equally strong for all types of trauma, with victims of penetrating injuries, such as gunshot and stab wounds, seeming to show the greatest benefit from alcohol .  Friedman broke his data into subgroups, classified by severity and type of injury, before drawing any conclusions, to account for the possibility that drinkers suffer a disproportionate amount of relatively minor traumatic injuries.  There is a folk belief that drunken injuries, especially those incurred during car crashes, are likely to be less severe, due perhaps to increased relaxation or limpness at the time of an accident. But Friedman says his research has convinced him that this belief is "probably grossly overestimated and false."  His findings don't show that a drunk driver's injuries during a car crash are likely to be less serious than those suffered by potential sober victims, just that if all parties suffer the same injuries, the sober ones are more likely to die.  "You don't die from the injury itself, you die from the subsequent physiological response, things like inflammation and rapid fluid loss," Friedman told Life's Little Mysteries. "If you get shot by a gun, it's not the hole that kills you."  And it's when a person's body goes into emergency preservation mode — tripping a cascade of physiological panic buttons that can ironically end in death — that alcohol seems to help most.  Friedman is conducting a follow-up study that looks at the relation between blood-alcohol content and the likelihood of complications that often result from traumatic injury, such as heart and kidney failure. His preliminary data suggests alcohol combats both of those outcomes, and this, he says, is consistent with the boost alcohol gives to myocardial contractility, or the heart's ability to pump blood.  Friedman's study notes that if drunken trauma victims are more likely to die before being hospitalized than their sober counterparts, his data sample may be biased.

Drunk-driving fatalities have fallen by a third in the last three decades; however, drunk-driving crashes claim more than 10,000 lives per year. In 2010, the most recent year for which cost data is available, these deaths and damages contributed to a cost of $44B per year.

Also see Drugged Driving   Alcohol is a substance that reduces the function of the brain, impairing thinking, reasoning and muscle coordination. All these abilities are essential to operating a vehicle safely.  As alcohol levels rise in a person’s system, the negative effects on the central nervous system increase, too. Alcohol is absorbed directly through the walls of the stomach and small intestine. Then it passes into the bloodstream where it accumulates until it is metabolized by the liver. Alcohol level is measured by the weight of the alcohol in a certain volume of blood. This is called Blood Alcohol Concentration, or BAC. At a BAC of .08 grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood (g/dL), crash risk increases exponentially. Because of this risk, it’s illegal in all 50 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to drive with a BAC of .08 or higher. However, even a small amount of alcohol can affect driving ability. In 2016, there were 2,017 people killed in alcohol-related crashes where drivers had lower alcohol levels (BACs of .01 to .07 g/dL).  BAC is measured with a breathalyzer, a device that measures the amount of alcohol in a driver’s breath, or by a blood test.        The Effects of Blood Alcohol Concentration    Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) in g/dL Typical Effects Predictable Effects on Driving    .02 Some loss of judgment; relaxation, slight body warmth, altered mood Decline in visual functions (rapid tracking of a moving target), decline in ability to perform two tasks at the same time (divided attention)   .05 Exaggerated behavior, may have loss of small-muscle control (e.g., focusing your eyes), impaired judgment, usually good feeling, lowered alertness, release of inhibition Reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, reduced response to emergency driving situations   .08 Muscle coordination becomes poor (e.g., balance, speech, vision, reaction time, and hearing), harder to detect danger; judgment, self-control, reasoning, and memory are impaired Concentration, short-term memory loss, speed control, reduced information processing capability (e.g., signal detection, visual search), impaired perception   .10 Clear deterioration of reaction time and control, slurred speech, poor coordination, and slowed thinking Reduced ability to maintain lane position and brake appropriately   .15 Far less muscle control than normal, vomiting may occur (unless this level is reached slowly or a person has developed a tolerance for alcohol), major loss of balance Substantial impairment in vehicle control, attention to driving task, and in necessary visual and auditory information processing    Table describing BAC and typical effects of various BAC levels                  The Issue    Risk Factors        Driving After Drinking    Age    Motorcyclists    Alcohol Abuse and Cost         Driving After Drinking  Driving after drinking is deadly. Yet it still continues to happen across the United States. If you drive while impaired, you could get arrested, or worse—be involved in a traffic crash that causes serious injury or death.  Approximately one-third of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States involve drunk drivers (with blood alcohol concentrations [BACs] of .08 of higher). In 2016, there were 10,497 people killed in these preventable crashes. In fact, on average over the 10-year period from 2006-2016, more than 10,000 people died every year in drunk-driving crashes.  In every State, it’s illegal to drive with a BAC of .08 or higher, yet one person was killed in a drunk-driving crash every 50 minutes in the United States in 2016.  Men are more likely than women to be driving drunk in fatal crashes. In 2016, 21 percent of males were drunk in these crashes, compared to 14 percent for females.  Take steps to prevent drunk driving:   If you will be drinking, plan on not driving. Plan your safe ride home before you start the party. Designate a sober driver ahead of time.  If you drink, do not drive for any reason. Call a taxi, phone a sober friend or family member, use public transportation, etc. Download NHTSA’s SaferRide mobile app which helps you identify your location and call a taxi or friend to pick you up.  If someone you know has been drinking, do not let that person get behind the wheel. Take their keys and help them arrange a sober ride home.  If you see an impaired driver on the road, contact local law enforcement. Your actions could help save someone’s life.         Car crashes are the leading cause of death for teens, and about a quarter of those crashes involve an underage drinking driver. In 2016, young drivers, 16-24 years old, made up 39 percent of drivers involved in fatal alcohol-impaired crashes.  To reduce alcohol-related fatal crashes among youth, all States have adopted a minimum legal drinking age of 21. NHTSA estimates that minimum-drinking-age laws have saved 31,417 lives between 1975 and 2016.  Young adults 25-34 make up another 29 percent of fatal alcohol-impaired-driving crashes. Men are most likely to be involved in this type of crash, with 4 male alcohol-impaired drivers for every female impaired driver.        In 2016, there were 4,950 motorcycle riders killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes. Of those, 1,259 (25%) were alcohol-impaired (BACs of .08 or higher). In addition, there were 335 fatally injured motorcycle riders who had lower alcohol levels (BACs of .01 to .07 g/dL).  Motorcycle riders have the highest overall rate of alcohol impairment in fatal crashes. In 2016, 25 percent of the motorcycle riders killed were riding impaired.  In 2016, the highest percentages of fatally injured, alcohol-impaired motorcycle riders were in the 35-to-39 age group (38%), followed by the 45-to-49 age group (37%), and the 40-to-44 age group (32%).        Repeat offenders who drink and drive are a very real, very deadly problem. Drivers with BACs of .08 g/dL or higher involved in fatal crashes were 4.5 times more likely to have prior convictions for driving while impaired (DWI) than were drivers with no alcohol (9% and 2%, respectively).  When it comes to drunk driving, it affects more than just the driver. In 2016, approximately 1 in 6 children (14 and younger) died in drunk-driving crashes. Fifty-four percent of the time, it was the child’s own driver who was drunk.  In addition to the human toll drunk driving takes on our country, the financial impact is devastating: based on 2010 numbers (the most recent year for which cost data is available), impaired-driving crashes costs the United States $44 billion annually.                  The Issue    Consequences     Driving a vehicle while impaired is a dangerous crime. Tough enforcement of drunk-driving laws has been a major factor in reducing alcohol-impaired-driving deaths since the 1980s. Charges range from misdemeanors to felony offenses, and penalties for impaired driving can include driver’s license revocation, fines, and jail time. It’s also extremely expensive. A first-time offense can cost the driver upwards of $10,000 in fines and legal fees.  Some States require offenders to install ignition interlock devices at the driver’s own expense. An ignition interlock device is a breath test device connected to a vehicle’s ignition. The vehicle will not start unless the driver blows into the interlock and has a BAC below a pre-set low limit, usually .02 g/dL. NHTSA strongly supports the expansion of ignition interlocks as a proven technology that keeps drunk drivers from getting behind the wheel.              The Issue    Responsible behavior     BEING A RESPONSIBLE DRIVER IS SIMPLE—IF YOU ARE DRINKING, DO NOT DRIVE.   Before drinking, choose a non-drinking friend as a designated driver.  Don’t let your friends drive impaired.  If you have been drinking, call a taxi or ride service. Download NHTSA's SaferRide app to help you call a friend or family member, pinpoint your location, and arrange to be picked up.  If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, make sure all guests leave with a sober driver.  Always wear your seat belt—it’s your best defense against impaired drivers.                 NHTSA In Action    NHTSA is dedicated to eliminating risky behaviors on our nation's roads       Through research, public awareness campaigns, and State safety grant programs, NHTSA demonstrates its commitment to eliminating drunk driving. Our programs have consistently reduced alcohol-related crash fatalities. We will continue until there are zero drunk-driving crashes on our roadways.

This is one death every 51 minutes. 1 The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion. 2  Thankfully, there are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from alcohol-impaired driving.   The Problem Risk Factors BAC Effects Prevention Additional Resources The Problem How big is the problem?  In 2015, 10,265 people died in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for nearly one-third (29%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. 1  Of the 1, 1,132 traffic deaths among children ages 0 to 14 years in 2015, 209 (16%) involved an alcohol-impaired driver. 1  In 2015, nearly 1.1 million drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. 3 That’s one percent of the 111 million self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaired driving among U.S. adults each year. 4  Drugs other than alcohol (legal and illegal) are involved in about 16% of motor vehicle crashes. 5  Marijuana use is increasing 6 and 13% of nighttime, weekend drivers have marijuana in their system. 7  Marijuana users were about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers with no evidence of marijuana use, however other factors – such as age and gender – may account for the increased crash risk among marijuana users. 5  Annual Self-reported Alcohol-impaired Driving Episodes among U.S. Adults, 1993–2014  Source: CDC. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 1993–2014. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss Note: The annual estimated alcohol-impaired driving episodes were calculated using BRFSS respondents’ answers to this question: “During the past 30 days, how many times have you driven when you’ve had perhaps too much to drink?” Annual estimates per respondent were calculated by multiplying the reported episodes during the preceding 30 days by 12. These numbers were summed to obtain the annual national estimates (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a2.htm ). Risk Factors Who is most at risk?  Young people:  At all levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC), the risk of being involved in a crash is greater for young people than for older people. 8  Among drivers with BAC levels of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes in 2015, nearly three in 10 were between 21 and 24 years of age (28%). The next two largest groups were ages 25 to 34 (27%) and 35 to 44 (23%). 1  Motorcyclists:  Among motorcyclists killed in fatal crashes in 2015, 27% had BACs of 0.08% or greater. 1  Motorcyclists ages 35-39 have the highest percentage of deaths with BACs of 0.08% or greater (37% in 2015). 9  Drivers with prior driving while impaired (DWI) convictions:  Drivers with a BAC of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes were 4.5 times more likely to have a prior conviction for DWI than were drivers with no alcohol in their system. (9% and 2%, respectively). 1  BAC Effects What are the effects of blood alcohol concentration (BAC)?  Information in this table shows the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at which the effect usually is first observed.  Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)*  Typical Effects  Predictable Effects on Driving  .02% About 2 alcoholic drinks**   Some loss of judgment  Relaxation  Slight body warmth  Altered mood    Decline in visual functions (rapid tracking of a moving target)  Decline in ability to perform two tasks at the same time (divided attention)   .05% About 3 alcoholic drinks**   Exaggerated behavior  May have loss of small-muscle control (e.g., focusing your eyes)  Impaired judgment  Usually good feeling  Lowered alertness  Release of inhibition    Reduced coordination  Reduced ability to track moving objects  Difficulty steering  Reduced response to emergency driving situations   .08% About 4 alcoholic drinks**   Muscle coordination becomes poor (e.g., balance, speech, vision, reaction time, and hearing)  Harder to detect danger  Judgment, self-control, reasoning, and memory are impaired    Concentration  Short-term memory loss  Speed control  Reduced information processing capability (e.g., signal detection, visual search)  Impaired perception   .10% About 5 alcoholic drinks**   Clear deterioration of reaction time and control  Slurred speech, poor coordination, and slowed thinking    Reduced ability to maintain lane position and brake appropriately   .15% About 7 alcoholic drinks**   Far less muscle control than normal  Vomiting may occur (unless this level is reached slowly or a person has developed a tolerance for alcohol)  Major loss of balance    Substantial impairment in vehicle control, attention to driving task, and in necessary visual and auditory information processing    *Blood Alcohol Concentration Measurement  The number of drinks listed represents the approximate amount of alcohol that a 160-pound man would need to drink in one hour to reach the listed BAC in each category.  **A Standard Drink Size in the United States  A standard drink is equal to 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in  12-ounces of beer (5% alcohol content)  8-ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content)  5-ounces of wine (12% alcohol content)  1.5-ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey)   Adapted from The ABCs of BAC , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2005, and How to Control Your Drinking, WR Miller and RF Munoz, University of New Mexico, 1982. Prevention How can deaths and injuries from impaired driving be prevented?  Effective measures include:  Actively enforcing existing 0.08% BAC laws, minimum legal drinking age laws, and zero tolerance laws for drivers younger than 21 years old in all states. 4,10  Requiring ignition interlocks for all offenders, including first-time offenders 11  Using sobriety checkpoints . 12  Putting health promotion efforts into practice that influence economic, organizational, policy, and school/community action. 13,14  Using community-based approaches to alcohol control and DWI prevention. 10,14,15  Requiring mandatory substance abuse assessment and treatment, if needed, for DWI offenders. 16  Raising the unit price of alcohol by increasing taxes. 17  Areas for continued research:  Reducing the illegal BAC threshold  to 0.05%. 18-22  Mandatory blood alcohol testing when traffic crashes result in injury. 23  Does marijuana impair driving? How and at what level?  Does marijuana use increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes?  What safety steps can individuals take?  Whenever your social plans involve alcohol and/or drugs, make plans so that you don’t have to drive while impaired. For example:  Before drinking, designate a non-drinking driver when with a group.  Don’t let your friends drive impaired.  If you have been drinking or using drugs, get a ride home or call a taxi.  If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, remind your guests to plan ahead and designate their sober driver; offer alcohol-free beverages, and make sure all guests leave with a sober driver.

But when the number of alcohol impaired drivers increases, the odds skyrocket. Research into periods when motorists are most vulnerable to accidents involving alcohol-impaired drivers offers an instructive road map for avoiding those times when driving risks are the greatest.  According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), between 2001 and 2005, 36 fatalities occurred per day on average in the United States as a result of crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver. At certain times of the year, such as summers and holidays, those numbers rose dramatically. During the Christmas period, for example, an average of 45 fatalities involving an alcohol-impaired driver occurred each day, and soared to 54 per day over the New Year’s holiday. All these numbers would almost certainly be lower if breathalyzer use were more widespread.  The summer season usually offers the best weather and driving conditions of the year – dry roads, excellent visibility, and longer daylight hours. But the seasonal benefits can be negated by other factors. According to the NHTSA, a higher volume of holiday travelers, including a significantly higher number of alcohol-impaired drivers, cause nearly twice the number of automotive deaths during summer months than during the rest of the year combined.  “100 Deadliest Days” for Teens  The period between Memorial Day and Labor Day – summer vacation for most students – has been called "The 100 Deadliest Days" for teen drivers. Nine of the 10 deadliest days for youth on U.S. highways fall between May and August. One reason is that teens are drinking are younger ages.  Nine of the 10 deadliest days for youth on U.S. highways fall between May and August.  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an estimated 5.8% of teens ages 16 and 17, and 15.1% of 18 to 20 year olds reported driving under the influence of alcohol in 2010. The U.S. Department of Transportation found that a total of 3,115 teens ages 13-19 died in motor vehicle crashes that year, and about 2 out of 3 fatalities were males.  Too much free time and too little driving experience also risk for teenagers. In addition, they are more likely to engage in “distracted driving” behavior, which describes activities that can endanger the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Examples of distracted driving include texting, using a cell phone, or grooming while driving a motor vehicle.  Most Dangerous Holidays  During the holidays, the number of travelers on our nation’s roads peaks as friends and family come together to celebrate. As a result of holiday parties and gatherings, more drivers are impaired by alcohol, too. Unfortunately, fatalities resulting from accidents involving alcohol-impaired drivers have become so predictable that many state highway patrol departments now issue fatality estimates, which usually prove to be all too accurate.  Lurking among the “100 Deadliest Days” of summer is the deadliest day of them all – the Fourth of July holiday. The IIHS studied deaths resulting from auto accidents from 2005 to 2009 and ranked the July 4 as the deadliest day of the year, with 144 driving-related fatalities on average. Teens accounted for nearly 10% of the fatalities.  The most traveled holiday period of the year is Thanksgiving weekend, and DUI arrests are at their highest between Thanksgiving and the end of New Year’s weekend. Thanksgiving Eve is even referred to as “Black Wednesday,” as it may be the busiest night of the year for bars. Social binge drinking (consumption of a high volume of alcohol in a short period of time) is also common at this time of year.  During the Christmas and New Year period, the average number of fatalities involving an alcohol-impaired driver rose 34%. This numbers would almost certainly be lower if breathalyzer use were more widespread.  The U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that 40% of traffic-related deaths during Christmas and New Year's involve drunk drivers -- a 12% increase over the rest of the month of December. According to the NHTSA, 2,597 people lost their lives due to motor vehicle traffic crashes during December 2010. The NHTSA also found that an average of 36 fatalities occurred each day in the U.S. 2001 and 2005 as a result of crashes involving an alcohol impaired driver. That number increased to 45 per day during the 3-day Christmas period and jumped to 54 per day over New Year’s holiday period.  Predictably, driving danger is higher than average during other holiday periods, too. According to the NHTSA, during Labor Day weekend in 2010, 147 people in the U.S. were killed as a result of drunk driving, which represented 36% of all highway fatalities during that period.  Other Dangerous Days and Times  The IIHS found that the second deadliest day after July 4 was September 2, followed by August 13, July 15, May 20, and November 11. Perhaps surprisingly, New Year's Eve ranked 7th, with 130 average fatalities.  IIHS also discovered that seven of the 25 deadliest days in the U.S. occurred during August, which made it the deadliest month on the road. September and July rank as the second and third deadliest months, according to the NHTSA, and March had the fewest auto fatalities.  Many of the deadliest days occur when people celebrate special occasions and events, such as Cinco de Mayo or the Super Bowl. For example, a NHTSA study found that alcohol-related crashes claimed a life every 51 minutes on St. Patrick’s Day in 2010, accounting for 32% of all fatalities that occurred that day.  The NHTSA reports that most accidents occur during "rush hour," between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  And according to the NHTSA, Saturday is the most dangerous day of the week to drive, primarily because there are more cars – and more drunk drivers – on the road than any other day. According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, 31% of fatal drunk-driving accidents occur on the weekend, and the highest number of drunk drivers is on the road between midnight and 3 a.m. Fatal crashes are also four times higher at night than during the day.  Dangerous Days to Walk  While New Year’s Day might not be the most dangerous day to drive, it’s probably the most dangerous day to walk. According to a 2005 article in the journal Injury Prevention, more pedestrian deaths occur on New Year's Day than any other day, including Halloween.  Pedestrian deaths are also more likely to occur on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, when nearly half (49%) of all pedestrian fatalities occurred. Alcohol involvement — for driver or pedestrian — was reported in nearly half of all traffic crashes resulting in pedestrian deaths. And in one-third of pedestrian fatalities, the pedestrian was intoxicated.  The most traveled holiday period of the year is Thanksgiving weekend. DUI arrests are at their highest between Thanksgiving and the end of New Year’s weekend.  In 2008, 69,000 pedestrians were injured in traffic crashes and 4,378 were killed, according to the CDC. One pedestrian was injured every eight minutes and one was killed every two hours. Thirty-eight percent pedestrian fatalities for those under age 16 occurred between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Your Deadliest Days to Drive  It’s easy to calculate your own Most Dangerous Days to Drive. Anytime you consume alcohol and drive, you increase your risk of being in a car accident. Highway patrol departments are more familiar with the data than you. If you plan to drink during periods when driving dangers are elevated, be aware that the highway patrol is on alert, and that are determined to get intoxicated drivers off the highways.

Information about the number and cost of impaired driving incidents and the cost saving from prevention strategies has not always been available or accessible in an easy-to-use format.  The National Public Services Research Institute developed state-specific data on impaired driving for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The series of State Cost Fact Sheets is available only on NHTSA's website. These fact sheets show the cost of impaired driving for a particular state and estimate the savings a state could realize if it implemented certain impaired driving countermeasures. There is also a U.S. Cost Fact Sheet that lists the national costs.  A Methods and Definitions Fact Sheet accompanies the individual state fact sheets. It describes how the costs and savings estimates were calculated and gives the references citations. The Methods pages should always accompany the U.S. and state fact sheets.  The State Cost Fact Sheet User's Guide goes into more detail about state-level estimates and describes how they can be used to educate the public about the costs of impaired driving. The cost estimates give an index of the magnitude of the impaired driving problem, and help establish how high a priority impaired driving should be compared to the overall costs of other types of problems. They identify types of alcohol-related crashes that merit immediate attention and project net savings from implementing various impaired driving countermeasures.  HOW TO OBTAIN  These are available only on NHTSA's website, http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/traffic_tech/2000/www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/alcohol/facts.htm Most public libraries can provide Internet access.   Sample of the U.S. Fact Sheet  Incidence of Impaired Driving  For one of every 140 miles driven in the United States in 1998, a driver whose BAC exceeded the legal limit (BAC .10) sat behind the wheel. Police in the United States report 438,000 crashes involving a driver or pedestrian with a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Formulas developed by NHTSA were used to estimate the number of alcohol- related crashes where alcohol involvement is not reported by the police. An estimated total of 1,049,900 crashes in the United States involved alcohol. These crashes killed 15,935 people and injured an estimated 821,000 more. Of the nonfatal injuries, 630,000 were police-reported and only these are detailed in the state cost fact sheets.  Impaired Driving by Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)  In 1998, the United States drivers with:   BACs of .10 and above were involved in an estimated 999,000 crashes that killed 15,530 and injured 719,000  BACs between .08-.09 were involved in an estimated 17,200 crashes that killed 993 and injured 32,000  Positive BACs below .08 were involved in an estimated 33,700 crashes that killed 2,412 and injured 70,000   Costs  Alcohol is a factor in 35% of the United States crashes. Alcohol-related crashes in the United States cost the public more than $110 billion in 1998, including more than $40 billion in monetary costs and almost $70 billion in quality of life losses. Alcohol-related crashes are deadlier and more serious than other crashes. People other than the drinking driver paid $51 billion of the alcohol-related crash bill.  Costs Per Alcohol-Related Injury  The average alcohol-related fatality in the United States cost $3.2 million: $1.2 million in monetary costs and $2 million in quality of life losses. The estimated cost per injured survivor of an alcohol-related crash averaged $79,000: $36,000 in monetary costs and $43,000 in quality of life losses.  Costs Per Mile Driven  Crash costs in the United States averaged:   $5.80 per mile driven at BACs of .10 and above  $2.50 per mile driven at BACs between .08-.09  $0.10 per mile driven at BACs of .00   Costs Per Drink  The societal costs of alcohol-related crashes in the United States averaged $0.80 per drink consumed. People other than the drinking driver paid $0.40 per drink.  Impact on Auto Insurance Rates  Alcohol-related crashes accounted for an estimated 16% of the $127 billion in U.S. auto insurance payments. Reducing alcohol-related crashes by 10% would save $3 billion in claims payments and loss adjustment expenses.  Prevention Savings  The United States already has many important impaired driving laws. However, a number of additional strategies can be used to mitigate the harm from impaired driving.   Enforcing Serving Intoxicated Patrons Law: Using undercover police officers to enforce the state laws against serving alcohol to intoxicated bar and restaurant patrons would reduce alcohol-related crash fatalities by an estimated 11%. It would cost $0.30 per licensed driver and save $30 per licensed driver.  Administrative License Revocation: Laws that allow police or driver licensing authorities to revoke a driver's license swiftly and automatically for refusing or failing a BAC test would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by 6.5% and save an estimated $44,000 per driver sanctioned. The value of the driver's lost mobility is the large majority of the $2,300 cost per driver sanctioned. Reinstatement fees assessed to offenders more than cover start-up and operating costs.    .08 BAC Law: Lowering driver BAC limits to .08 would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by 8% and save an estimated $2 per licensed driver. The value of mobility losses and alcohol sales reductions resulting from the   law are the large majority of the $0.20 cost per licensed driver.   Graduated Licensing: Graduated licensing would impose a nighttime driving restriction or passenger limits for young novice drivers. Graduated licensing with a midnight curfew would reduce youth fatalities by 5-8% and total alcohol-related fatalities by 2%. It would save an estimated $600 per youthful driver. The value of the mobility lost by youth is the large majority of the $60 cost per youthful driver.  Ignition Interlock: Breath-testing ignition interlocks are designed to prevent anyone with a BAC above the legal limit from starting or driving a car. Attaching an interlock to a car for a year after its operator is convicted of driving while intoxicated would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by an estimated 7%-12% and save $10,200 per vehicle equipped. Including the value of mobility lost, as well as equipment and case management costs, interlock costs would total $1,100 per vehicle. Existing programs typically recover their equipment and case management costs from sanctioned drivers.  Sobriety Checkpoint Program: Intensive enforcement of state BAC limits with highly visible sobriety checkpoints would reduce alcohol-related fatalities by at least 15% and save $50,700 per checkpoint. Including costs of travel delay and the value of mobility losses by impaired drivers apprehended and sanctioned, the costs of conducting a checkpoint would average $7,600 including police resources.  Primary Belt Law: Primary belt laws allow law enforcement to stop and ticket a driver for non-use of a safety belt without requiring the driver to be cited for or have committed another offense. Unbelted drivers account for 75% of impaired driving fatalities. Primary belt laws can reduce alcohol-related fatalities in the United States by approximately 10%. The laws would save $200 per licensed driver. If enforced with frequent belt-use checkpoints, the value of temporary discomfort experienced by some new belt wearers and travel delay costs at checkpoints would be the large majority of the law's $3.50 cost per licensed driver.

In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile.  Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving.  Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. We hope with a little information, you'll make the right decision when you're on the road.  General Cell Phone Statistics  Note: These are the most recent statistics available   The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.  Nearly 330,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.  1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.  Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.  Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.  Texting while driving causes a 400% increase in time spent with eyes off the road.  Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.  94% of drivers support a ban on texting while driving.  74% of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use.   Teen Driver Cell Phone Statistics   According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway.  21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones.  Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone.  A teen driver with only one additional passenger doubles the risk of getting into a fatal car accident. With two or more passengers, they are 5x as likely.   2013 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics   In 2013, 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes.  About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver.  In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.   2012 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics   In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction-related crashes.  About 421,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver.  In 2012, 11% of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.  One-fourth of teenagers respond to at least one text message every time they drive and 20% of teens and 10% of parents report having multi-text message conversations while driving.   2012 National Survey on Distracted Driving Attitudes and Behaviors   Nearly half (48%) of drivers admit to answering their cell phones while driving.  Of those who answered their phones while driving, 58% of drivers continued to drive while talking on the phone .  In the survey, 24% of drivers reported that they are willing to make a phone call while driving.  One in 10 drivers surveyed said that, at least sometimes, they send text messages or emails while driving.  Of the drivers surveyed, 14% said they read text messages or emails while driving .  A majority of respondents supported laws that banned talking on cell phones, texting, or emailing while driving.   2012 Texting Pedestrian Study  Researchers from the University of Washington monitored 20 of Seattle's busiest intersections and observed the following:   Pedestrians who text are 4x less likely to look before crossing the street, cross in crosswalks, or obey traffic signals.  They also found that texting pedestrians take an average of two seconds longer to cross the street.   For statistics from 2011 and before, check out our Past Cell Phone and Driving Statistics .

I've already written about how the data show that stoned driving is a lot safer than drunk driving . But one of the reports also quantifies the increase in crash risk as a driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) increases, and boy is it something.      In all 50 states, the legal threshold for driving under the influence falls at 0.08% BAC . But as you can see from this chart, the risk of a car crash starts rising at BAC thresholds well below that. At a BAC of 0.05 -- completely street-legal -- your odds of wrecking your car have increased 100 percent versus someone who hasn't drunk at all. At 0.08, your crash odds have roughly tripled.  Depending on your weight and gender, it doesn't take many drinks to reach those BAC thresholds . If you're a 160-pound man, it takes just two drinks in an hour to reach a BAC of 0.05. If you're a 120-pound woman, 2 drinks will land you in 0.08 territory.  For that 160-pound man, five drinks in an hour leads to a BAC of .12 and an elevated crash risk of 682 percent (no, that figure's not missing any decimals).  These numbers underscore the arbitrariness of the 0.08 DUI threshold -- why do we accept a doubled risk of crash at 0.05 BAC, but not a triple risk? And why do we severely punish stoned driving at THC thresholds that correspond to no increased risk of crash at all ?                     Christopher Ingraham writes about politics, drug policy and all things data. He previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center.

Despite all the warnings, public awareness and educational programs, stiffer penalties for violations, people will still get behind the wheel of their vehicles while intoxicated.         While drunk driving numbers have decreased in the past couple of decades for youths and teens, they are still at risk whether they are the drivers or not. Motor vehicle wrecks are the leading cause of death in the United States for persons under age 24, whether as the driver or the passenger, with almost half involving alcohol as a factor in the crash. How Dangerous Is Drinking and Driving? A driver with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10 or greater is seven times more likely to be involved in a fatal motor vehicle crash than is a driver who has not consumed alcoholic beverages, and a driver with an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or greater is about 25 times more likely. Basically, the more you drink, the more likely you are to have an accident—and a fatal one. The same applies for the likelihood of having any vehicle accident, fatal or otherwise. Here are the cold, hard facts. More Likely to Have a Crash A 160-pound person drinking two 12-ounce beers within an hour would probably have a BAC of 0.02, well below the legal limits of driving under the influence, but 1.4 times more likely to have an accident than someone who is sober.   One of the problems with setting the legal limit for "drunk driving" at a blood-alcohol content level of 0.08 is it sends the message that if you are not yet legally drunk, you are therefore okay to drive. Impairment Begins Below 0.08 BAC The problem lies in the fact that impairment begins long before you reach the 0.08 level.         Scientific research shows explicitly that some of the skills that you need to drive safely begin to deteriorate even at the 0.02 blood-alcohol level. Experiments have shown that drivers at the 0.02 level experience a decline in visual functions—their ability to track a moving object—and experience a decline in the ability to perform two tasks at the same time. Two More Beers? If you had those first two beers that raised your BAC to 0.08 and now you drink two more beers, your likelihood of an accident goes up almost tenfold. At 0.08 BAC, a driver is 11 times more likely than the non-drinking driver to be involved in a crash. As the amount of alcohol in the driver's system rises mathematically on the BAC scale , the likelihood of a traffic accident multiples . Now add two more beers to your total, you are up to having consumed a six-pack. The likelihood of having an accident is now 48 times higher than the abstainer and the driver has just now passed the 0.10 BAC level. Two more beers: Hey, you've already had a six-pack, two more couldn't hurt, right? Except two more beers could put your BAC close to 0.15 at which point you are 380 times more likely to have an accident. Play It Smart Play it smart during weekends and holidays.         If you plan to party away from home—and this includes on the water—be sure to appoint a designated driver for the car or operator of the boat. Whatever you do, don't get behind the wheel if you've been drinking. Consider calling a cab or using a rideshare app to get yourself and your loved ones home safely and protect every else on the road. Better yet, if you are going to be drinking away from home, use those options so you don't have a car handy you'll be tempted to drive when your judgment is impaired by alcohol.

This is one death every 51 minutes. 1 The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion. 2  Thankfully, there are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from alcohol-impaired driving.   The Problem Risk Factors BAC Effects Prevention Additional Resources The Problem How big is the problem?  In 2015, 10,265 people died in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for nearly one-third (29%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. 1  Of the 1, 1,132 traffic deaths among children ages 0 to 14 years in 2015, 209 (16%) involved an alcohol-impaired driver. 1  In 2015, nearly 1.1 million drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. 3 That’s one percent of the 111 million self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaired driving among U.S. adults each year. 4  Drugs other than alcohol (legal and illegal) are involved in about 16% of motor vehicle crashes. 5  Marijuana use is increasing 6 and 13% of nighttime, weekend drivers have marijuana in their system. 7  Marijuana users were about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers with no evidence of marijuana use, however other factors – such as age and gender – may account for the increased crash risk among marijuana users. 5  Annual Self-reported Alcohol-impaired Driving Episodes among U.S. Adults, 1993–2014  Source: CDC. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 1993–2014. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss Note: The annual estimated alcohol-impaired driving episodes were calculated using BRFSS respondents’ answers to this question: “During the past 30 days, how many times have you driven when you’ve had perhaps too much to drink?” Annual estimates per respondent were calculated by multiplying the reported episodes during the preceding 30 days by 12. These numbers were summed to obtain the annual national estimates (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a2.htm ). Risk Factors Who is most at risk?  Young people:  At all levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC), the risk of being involved in a crash is greater for young people than for older people. 8  Among drivers with BAC levels of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes in 2015, nearly three in 10 were between 21 and 24 years of age (28%). The next two largest groups were ages 25 to 34 (27%) and 35 to 44 (23%). 1  Motorcyclists:  Among motorcyclists killed in fatal crashes in 2015, 27% had BACs of 0.08% or greater. 1  Motorcyclists ages 35-39 have the highest percentage of deaths with BACs of 0.08% or greater (37% in 2015). 9  Drivers with prior driving while impaired (DWI) convictions:  Drivers with a BAC of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes were 4.5 times more likely to have a prior conviction for DWI than were drivers with no alcohol in their system. (9% and 2%, respectively). 1  BAC Effects What are the effects of blood alcohol concentration (BAC)?  Information in this table shows the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at which the effect usually is first observed.  Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)*  Typical Effects  Predictable Effects on Driving  .02% About 2 alcoholic drinks**   Some loss of judgment  Relaxation  Slight body warmth  Altered mood    Decline in visual functions (rapid tracking of a moving target)  Decline in ability to perform two tasks at the same time (divided attention)   .05% About 3 alcoholic drinks**   Exaggerated behavior  May have loss of small-muscle control (e.g., focusing your eyes)  Impaired judgment  Usually good feeling  Lowered alertness  Release of inhibition    Reduced coordination  Reduced ability to track moving objects  Difficulty steering  Reduced response to emergency driving situations   .08% About 4 alcoholic drinks**   Muscle coordination becomes poor (e.g., balance, speech, vision, reaction time, and hearing)  Harder to detect danger  Judgment, self-control, reasoning, and memory are impaired    Concentration  Short-term memory loss  Speed control  Reduced information processing capability (e.g., signal detection, visual search)  Impaired perception   .10% About 5 alcoholic drinks**   Clear deterioration of reaction time and control  Slurred speech, poor coordination, and slowed thinking    Reduced ability to maintain lane position and brake appropriately   .15% About 7 alcoholic drinks**   Far less muscle control than normal  Vomiting may occur (unless this level is reached slowly or a person has developed a tolerance for alcohol)  Major loss of balance    Substantial impairment in vehicle control, attention to driving task, and in necessary visual and auditory information processing    *Blood Alcohol Concentration Measurement  The number of drinks listed represents the approximate amount of alcohol that a 160-pound man would need to drink in one hour to reach the listed BAC in each category.  **A Standard Drink Size in the United States  A standard drink is equal to 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in  12-ounces of beer (5% alcohol content)  8-ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content)  5-ounces of wine (12% alcohol content)  1.5-ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey)   Adapted from The ABCs of BAC , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2005, and How to Control Your Drinking, WR Miller and RF Munoz, University of New Mexico, 1982. Prevention How can deaths and injuries from impaired driving be prevented?  Effective measures include:  Actively enforcing existing 0.08% BAC laws, minimum legal drinking age laws, and zero tolerance laws for drivers younger than 21 years old in all states. 4,10  Requiring ignition interlocks for all offenders, including first-time offenders 11  Using sobriety checkpoints . 12  Putting health promotion efforts into practice that influence economic, organizational, policy, and school/community action. 13,14  Using community-based approaches to alcohol control and DWI prevention. 10,14,15  Requiring mandatory substance abuse assessment and treatment, if needed, for DWI offenders. 16  Raising the unit price of alcohol by increasing taxes. 17  Areas for continued research:  Reducing the illegal BAC threshold  to 0.05%. 18-22  Mandatory blood alcohol testing when traffic crashes result in injury. 23  Does marijuana impair driving? How and at what level?  Does marijuana use increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes?  What safety steps can individuals take?  Whenever your social plans involve alcohol and/or drugs, make plans so that you don’t have to drive while impaired. For example:  Before drinking, designate a non-drinking driver when with a group.  Don’t let your friends drive impaired.  If you have been drinking or using drugs, get a ride home or call a taxi.  If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, remind your guests to plan ahead and designate their sober driver; offer alcohol-free beverages, and make sure all guests leave with a sober driver.

View and download data , and identify strategies to help keep people safe on the road – every day.  About one in three traffic deaths in the United States involve a driver with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or higher. Drivers with a BAC of 0.08% or higher (i.e., drunk drivers) are considered alcohol-impaired by law. Thanks to dedicated efforts, rates of drunk driving and alcohol-related fatal crashes have gone down in recent years. Still, drunk drivers got behind the wheel about 121 million times in 2012.

But new research suggests that once an injury has occurred, the same substance that leads drinkers to folly may help save them from its consequences.  The results of a study from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) show that not only does an appreciable blood-alcohol level seem to increase a trauma victim's chances of survival after being admitted to a hospital, but that the drunker a victim is, the more likely he or she is to survive.  "After an injury, if you are intoxicated there seems to be a pretty substantial protective effect," said Lee Friedman, the author of the study and an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at UIC, in  a statment issued by the school. "The more alcohol you have in your system, the more the protective effect."  Friedman's study shows a correlation between a high blood-alcohol content and an increased chance of survival after a serious injury, but it doesn't necessarily demonstrate that alcohol is the root cause of the increase.  While previous studies have examined the interactions between trauma outcome and blood-alcohol content, most have focused either on particular injuries, such as head trauma , or particular injury mechanisms, such as car accidents.  Friedman analyzed all 190,612 patients treated at Illinois' trauma centers between 1995 and 2009 who were tested for blood-alcohol content, with levels ranging from zero to 0.5 percent at time of admission. (Blood-alcohol levels above about 0.35 percent can be fatal.) He found that with the exception of burn injuries, the mortality rates of all types of traumatic injury decreased as the blood-alcohol content of victims rose. [ 7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health ]  At the upper bounds of intoxication, mortality rates were cut by nearly 50 percent, said Friedman. The effect, however, was not equally strong for all types of trauma, with victims of penetrating injuries, such as gunshot and stab wounds, seeming to show the greatest benefit from alcohol .  Friedman broke his data into subgroups, classified by severity and type of injury, before drawing any conclusions, to account for the possibility that drinkers suffer a disproportionate amount of relatively minor traumatic injuries.  There is a folk belief that drunken injuries, especially those incurred during car crashes, are likely to be less severe, due perhaps to increased relaxation or limpness at the time of an accident. But Friedman says his research has convinced him that this belief is "probably grossly overestimated and false."  His findings don't show that a drunk driver's injuries during a car crash are likely to be less serious than those suffered by potential sober victims, just that if all parties suffer the same injuries, the sober ones are more likely to die.  "You don't die from the injury itself, you die from the subsequent physiological response, things like inflammation and rapid fluid loss," Friedman told Life's Little Mysteries. "If you get shot by a gun, it's not the hole that kills you."  And it's when a person's body goes into emergency preservation mode — tripping a cascade of physiological panic buttons that can ironically end in death — that alcohol seems to help most.  Friedman is conducting a follow-up study that looks at the relation between blood-alcohol content and the likelihood of complications that often result from traumatic injury, such as heart and kidney failure. His preliminary data suggests alcohol combats both of those outcomes, and this, he says, is consistent with the boost alcohol gives to myocardial contractility, or the heart's ability to pump blood.  Friedman's study notes that if drunken trauma victims are more likely to die before being hospitalized than their sober counterparts, his data sample may be biased.

Drunk-driving fatalities have fallen by a third in the last three decades; however, drunk-driving crashes claim more than 10,000 lives per year. In 2010, the most recent year for which cost data is available, these deaths and damages contributed to a cost of $44B per year.

Also see Drugged Driving   Alcohol is a substance that reduces the function of the brain, impairing thinking, reasoning and muscle coordination. All these abilities are essential to operating a vehicle safely.  As alcohol levels rise in a person’s system, the negative effects on the central nervous system increase, too. Alcohol is absorbed directly through the walls of the stomach and small intestine. Then it passes into the bloodstream where it accumulates until it is metabolized by the liver. Alcohol level is measured by the weight of the alcohol in a certain volume of blood. This is called Blood Alcohol Concentration, or BAC. At a BAC of .08 grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood (g/dL), crash risk increases exponentially. Because of this risk, it’s illegal in all 50 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to drive with a BAC of .08 or higher. However, even a small amount of alcohol can affect driving ability. In 2016, there were 2,017 people killed in alcohol-related crashes where drivers had lower alcohol levels (BACs of .01 to .07 g/dL).  BAC is measured with a breathalyzer, a device that measures the amount of alcohol in a driver’s breath, or by a blood test.        The Effects of Blood Alcohol Concentration    Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) in g/dL Typical Effects Predictable Effects on Driving    .02 Some loss of judgment; relaxation, slight body warmth, altered mood Decline in visual functions (rapid tracking of a moving target), decline in ability to perform two tasks at the same time (divided attention)   .05 Exaggerated behavior, may have loss of small-muscle control (e.g., focusing your eyes), impaired judgment, usually good feeling, lowered alertness, release of inhibition Reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, reduced response to emergency driving situations   .08 Muscle coordination becomes poor (e.g., balance, speech, vision, reaction time, and hearing), harder to detect danger; judgment, self-control, reasoning, and memory are impaired Concentration, short-term memory loss, speed control, reduced information processing capability (e.g., signal detection, visual search), impaired perception   .10 Clear deterioration of reaction time and control, slurred speech, poor coordination, and slowed thinking Reduced ability to maintain lane position and brake appropriately   .15 Far less muscle control than normal, vomiting may occur (unless this level is reached slowly or a person has developed a tolerance for alcohol), major loss of balance Substantial impairment in vehicle control, attention to driving task, and in necessary visual and auditory information processing    Table describing BAC and typical effects of various BAC levels                  The Issue    Risk Factors        Driving After Drinking    Age    Motorcyclists    Alcohol Abuse and Cost         Driving After Drinking  Driving after drinking is deadly. Yet it still continues to happen across the United States. If you drive while impaired, you could get arrested, or worse—be involved in a traffic crash that causes serious injury or death.  Approximately one-third of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States involve drunk drivers (with blood alcohol concentrations [BACs] of .08 of higher). In 2016, there were 10,497 people killed in these preventable crashes. In fact, on average over the 10-year period from 2006-2016, more than 10,000 people died every year in drunk-driving crashes.  In every State, it’s illegal to drive with a BAC of .08 or higher, yet one person was killed in a drunk-driving crash every 50 minutes in the United States in 2016.  Men are more likely than women to be driving drunk in fatal crashes. In 2016, 21 percent of males were drunk in these crashes, compared to 14 percent for females.  Take steps to prevent drunk driving:   If you will be drinking, plan on not driving. Plan your safe ride home before you start the party. Designate a sober driver ahead of time.  If you drink, do not drive for any reason. Call a taxi, phone a sober friend or family member, use public transportation, etc. Download NHTSA’s SaferRide mobile app which helps you identify your location and call a taxi or friend to pick you up.  If someone you know has been drinking, do not let that person get behind the wheel. Take their keys and help them arrange a sober ride home.  If you see an impaired driver on the road, contact local law enforcement. Your actions could help save someone’s life.         Car crashes are the leading cause of death for teens, and about a quarter of those crashes involve an underage drinking driver. In 2016, young drivers, 16-24 years old, made up 39 percent of drivers involved in fatal alcohol-impaired crashes.  To reduce alcohol-related fatal crashes among youth, all States have adopted a minimum legal drinking age of 21. NHTSA estimates that minimum-drinking-age laws have saved 31,417 lives between 1975 and 2016.  Young adults 25-34 make up another 29 percent of fatal alcohol-impaired-driving crashes. Men are most likely to be involved in this type of crash, with 4 male alcohol-impaired drivers for every female impaired driver.        In 2016, there were 4,950 motorcycle riders killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes. Of those, 1,259 (25%) were alcohol-impaired (BACs of .08 or higher). In addition, there were 335 fatally injured motorcycle riders who had lower alcohol levels (BACs of .01 to .07 g/dL).  Motorcycle riders have the highest overall rate of alcohol impairment in fatal crashes. In 2016, 25 percent of the motorcycle riders killed were riding impaired.  In 2016, the highest percentages of fatally injured, alcohol-impaired motorcycle riders were in the 35-to-39 age group (38%), followed by the 45-to-49 age group (37%), and the 40-to-44 age group (32%).        Repeat offenders who drink and drive are a very real, very deadly problem. Drivers with BACs of .08 g/dL or higher involved in fatal crashes were 4.5 times more likely to have prior convictions for driving while impaired (DWI) than were drivers with no alcohol (9% and 2%, respectively).  When it comes to drunk driving, it affects more than just the driver. In 2016, approximately 1 in 6 children (14 and younger) died in drunk-driving crashes. Fifty-four percent of the time, it was the child’s own driver who was drunk.  In addition to the human toll drunk driving takes on our country, the financial impact is devastating: based on 2010 numbers (the most recent year for which cost data is available), impaired-driving crashes costs the United States $44 billion annually.                  The Issue    Consequences     Driving a vehicle while impaired is a dangerous crime. Tough enforcement of drunk-driving laws has been a major factor in reducing alcohol-impaired-driving deaths since the 1980s. Charges range from misdemeanors to felony offenses, and penalties for impaired driving can include driver’s license revocation, fines, and jail time. It’s also extremely expensive. A first-time offense can cost the driver upwards of $10,000 in fines and legal fees.  Some States require offenders to install ignition interlock devices at the driver’s own expense. An ignition interlock device is a breath test device connected to a vehicle’s ignition. The vehicle will not start unless the driver blows into the interlock and has a BAC below a pre-set low limit, usually .02 g/dL. NHTSA strongly supports the expansion of ignition interlocks as a proven technology that keeps drunk drivers from getting behind the wheel.              The Issue    Responsible behavior     BEING A RESPONSIBLE DRIVER IS SIMPLE—IF YOU ARE DRINKING, DO NOT DRIVE.   Before drinking, choose a non-drinking friend as a designated driver.  Don’t let your friends drive impaired.  If you have been drinking, call a taxi or ride service. Download NHTSA's SaferRide app to help you call a friend or family member, pinpoint your location, and arrange to be picked up.  If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, make sure all guests leave with a sober driver.  Always wear your seat belt—it’s your best defense against impaired drivers.                 NHTSA In Action    NHTSA is dedicated to eliminating risky behaviors on our nation's roads       Through research, public awareness campaigns, and State safety grant programs, NHTSA demonstrates its commitment to eliminating drunk driving. Our programs have consistently reduced alcohol-related crash fatalities. We will continue until there are zero drunk-driving crashes on our roadways.
