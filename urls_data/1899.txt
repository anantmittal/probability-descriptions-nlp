The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown. Also, make sure to check out our Freshlook Contact Lenses , which are the most popular, and most widely recommended colored contact lens available.

Though the color green often is associated with envy (even a character in Shakespeare's Othello refers to jealousy as "the green-ey'd monster"), many people consider green to be the most attractive eye color.  AllAboutVision.com recently conducted a survey of our visitors, asking them which eye color they considered most attractive. Here are the preferences, from more than 66,000 responses:                         Green eyes range in color from emerald to lime, and they produce an appearance that is both alluring and mysterious. [Enlarge]      Green: 20.3%  Light blue: 16.9%  Hazel: 16.0%  Dark blue: 15.2%  Gray: 10.9%  Honey: 7.9%  Amethyst: 6.9%  Brown: 5.9%   Part of the appeal of green eyes may be their rarity. Reliable statistics of the distribution of eye colors are difficult to find, but some sources put the worldwide prevalence of green eyes at only 2 percent.  On the other hand, a recent multi-year survey of students at a large Midwestern university in the United States found the prevalence of green eyes to be 15.2 percent.  Also, the prevalence of green eyes varies significantly by geographical region and country, with the greatest concentration in Northern and Central Europe. For example, in Edinburgh, Scotland, it's estimated that 29 percent of residents have green eyes (57 percent have blue eyes and only 14 percent have brown eyes ). In Iceland, a survey of the population revealed 89 percent of women and 87 percent of men have blue or green eye color.  What Produces Green Eyes?  Genetics play a role in determining eye color. But it's nearly impossible to predict with 100 percent certainty the eye color of a child simply by knowing the color of his or her parents' eyes.  This is because many different genes are involved in the inheritance of eye color, and different interactions and levels of expression of these genes can alter eye color outcomes.

The structure within the eye that is responsible for eye color is called the iris  the thin, circular structure that surrounds the pupil. In addition to controlling the size of the pupil and therefore the amount of light that enters the eye, the iris contains pigmented cells that determine eye color.     But here's where it gets interesting. Though there are many different eye colors, there are surprisingly few types of eye pigments. In fact, nearly all eye colors are determined by how much brown-colored pigment called melanin is contained in cells in the iris.  So how does a brown-colored pigment create green eyes  or blue eyes, or hazel eyes , or any eye color other than brown?  Differences in eye color are the result of different amounts of melanin pigment granules within cells in the iris called melanocytes. These cells acquire their genetically determined amount of melanin in early childhood, and their melanin content usually remains relatively constant throughout life.  A person with less melanin in the melanocytes of his or her iris will have a lighter eye color (blue or green, for example) than a person with a greater concentration of melanin, who will likely have brown eyes.  SEE ALSO:  What Determines Hazel Eye Color >  But an additional factor is involved in determining eye color, especially different shades of green eyes and blue eyes. When light strikes the iris and the pigment-containing melanocytes within the iris, this light is scattered and reflected. This phenomenon, called Rayleigh scattering, can produce different reflective colors, depending on the physical structure of the iris and the amount of melanocytes and density of melanin within the melanocytes.  Depending on these variables, Rayleigh scattering (which is the same phenomenon that makes a cloudless sky appear blue) can produce different shades of blue, green, hazel, and so on.  It's also noteworthy that, depending on the structure of the iris and the distribution of melanocytes within it, some eye colors can be difficult to categorize. For example, some "green" eyes may have a crown of hazel or brown near the pupil, making them appear hazel at times and green at other times, depending on lighting, makeup and the color of clothing a person wears.  Actress Emma Stone has green eyes. [Enlarge] (Photo: s_bukley / Shutterstock.com )  Celebrities With Green Eyes  Does the allure of green eyes help entertainers and other famous people get noticed? Maybe.  Here's a short list of actors, singers and other celebrities who might owe a small part of their appeal to their green eyes:  Adele, Adrien Brody, Daniel Day-Lewis, Katie Holmes, Terrence Howard, Kate Hudson, Scarlett Johansson, John Krasinski, Leona Lewis, Lindsay Lohan, Kate Middleton (Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge), Clive Owen, Joaquin Phoenix, Eddie Redmayne, Rihanna, Smokey Robinson, Paul Rudd,  Kristen Stewart, Emma Stone, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Charlize Theron, Bruce Willis.  Eyes Are Like Snowflakes  If you really wish you had green eyes instead of the eye color you were born with, one option is to wear color contact lenses . Several brands and shades of green contact lenses are available, including lenses without corrective power if you are lucky enough to have naturally perfect eyesight .  If you have naturally green eyes and you wear eyeglasses, lenses with anti-reflective (AR) coating will help showcase your green eye color. AR coating eliminates distracting reflections in your eyeglasses, allowing others to see the beauty and expressiveness of your green eyes.  Whatever color your eyes may be, they are truly unique and can never be replicated. Like snowflakes, the features of each and every eye are different and, therefore, magnificent  no matter what color your eyes are.

I was born with green eyes , a trait that I took from my mother. At first, I never understood the constant compliments I received for my eye color. I’ve heard a lot of sayings from friends, family members, and even strangers: “Trae, you have really pretty eyes” or “You could kill someone with eyes like that.”  People would even ask me to take off my glasses just to get a glimpse of what color my eyes were. I knew that my eye color was pretty unusual compared to my peers. Before I researched the origins of green eyes, I asked myself—are green eyes really attractive as people make it? Why are green eyes so rare?  One of the most common eye colors in the population is brown eyes . About 55% of people in the world have brown eyes. Brown eyes have dominant traits, and they are usually darker in color. The second common eye color is blue . However, green eyes are considered the rarest eye color. So, what makes green eyes rare? First of all, green eyes, in contrast to the common eye color, lack melanin (dark pigmentation that occurs in specific parts of the human body). Approximately 2% of people in the world have green eyes, and that’s a very small percentage.  Green eye color. Created by Catsastrific.  The most interesting thing about green eyes is that they are not naturally shown until a baby is at least 6 months old. Babies who eventually have green eyes are typically born with lighter eye colors, like gray or blue.  Because of these factors, green eyes prove to be an attractive trait. In fact, based on a study from All About Vision, a survey was created to determine which eye color is considered the most appealing to the person. The results demonstrated that 20.3% of the responses chose ‘green’ as their preference, while ‘light blue’ and ‘hazel’ eye colors have 3.4% less responses. The survey concluded that the majority appeal is due to the unusualness of the eye color.  The conclusion: Green eyes are considered attractive because it’s a rare color. Common eye colors like brown, blue, even black, are typically seen all around because of its pigmentation. Green eyes, however, are rarely seen and that’s what makes them appealing.  I’m pretty satisfied with my eye color. Not just because of the compliments, but my eye color makes me different. Perhaps that’s why people adore Channing Tatum so much?  Channing Tatum’s green eyes.

I have a feeling that this is something you can’t really boil down and address. The whole idea of the word “attractive” is that it applies to someone’s opinion and develops their interest more.  Green eyes are rare yes, but they could be present in anyone and be many different shades of green. How attractive someone with green eyes is depends on so many outside variables and opinions. I’m thinking that maybe this is too affected by chance and possibilities to be tackled logically.

Just look around you and take a good look at peoples eye colour. There is a high chance you will notice a lot of people with brown eyes. Brown eyes are by far most common in humans. In some countries, the brown eye colour is the only colour there is.  In other countries however, you would find a lot of diversity. Green, blue, hazel, grey and even violet eyes do exist as well.           Green eyes in the Middle East     Brown is the most common eye colour  In the US only 1 out of 6 people have a light (blue) eye colour. The brown eye colour is in the US the most prevalent. No surprise, because brown is also the dominant colour. In other countries, especially in northern Europe, brown is less common. Estonia for example is a very light eyed country with almost 98% having the blue eyes.   Africa is very brown   The further you go to the south, the more chance there is that you will find a person with brown eyes. In southern europe for instance, there is on average a change of 80% you will find a brown eyed person. Lighter eyes are also in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece) less common. Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared.   Light eyes in Scandinavia   Scandinavians tend to have a very light appearence. Light eyes are definitely the standard in these northern countries. Sweden, Norway and Denmark all have high percentages of light eyed people. Also Finland and Iceland are extremely light with almost 90% of them having light eyes (green, grey and blue). Other ''northern'' countries like The Netherlands, Scotland and Germany have light eyed peoples too. In The Netherlands approximately 80% of the inhabitants have green or blue eyes. Germany (especially the northern part of the country) follows with almost 70% having lighter eye colours.   Green eyes are rare   Within the ''light'' eyed population, the green eyes are outnumbered by the blue eyes. Green eyes are dominant over the blue eye colour but there are only very few people that carry the genes responsible for green eyes. Only 1-2% of the entire human population have green eyes.   Shades of green eyes   Green eyes can look very different. They can be very dark, almost brown. Sometimes they are very light: almost neon. It all depends on the amount and type of melanin inside the iris. If you have a lot of melanin, your eyes look darker and if you have only a tiny bit, your eyes tend to look very light (bright).  The light green eyes are most common in Iceland, The Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland, Estonia and Scandinavia. Dark green eyes can be find all over Europe, the US and even in Pakistan.       Dark green eyes      Light green eyes                                            Green eyes and red hair  Scientist suspects there is a relation between red hair and the green eye colour. It looks like there is a high correlation between those two human traits. Having the red hair colour is also very unique (and recessive). Only 1 - 2 % of the entire human population have naturally red hair. Of course, not only red hair coexist with green eyes. Also blondes and darker hair colours tend to have green eyes (or the other way around).    Green eyes and gender  Normally, you would expect a 50/50 gender variation between the eye colours (blue, brown), but scientist found a positive correlation between being a woman and having the green eye colour. Why green eyes are more found in women is still unknown and it is not certain a gender differentiation actually exist. The findings could be biased somehow.      red hair, green eyes and being male: the odds are very low     Hazel eyes are Green eyes?  Some people confuse hazel eyes with green eyes. Hazel eyes are also very rare but are different than green eyes. First of all, hazel eyes have more melanin. They look more brownish and are overall a bit darker, sometimes with a golden teint. People with hazel eyes often notice a considerable change in their eye colour, especially when a lot of light reflect on their eyes. Secondly, some green eyes have a lot of yellow pigment in them. Hazel eyes share this yellow pigmentation hence the confusion.       Eyes with a Green-Hazel colour    Where do green eyes come from?  Green eyes can be found anywhere but you will find them most of the time in Europe. Some people believe green eyes came to existence due to a mixture of blue and brown eyes. This idea became popular because a lot of green eyes can be found in areas where brown and blue eyes came together. When we look at the map, the highest percentage of green eyes can be found in Scotland. Ireland also has (relative) a lot of green eyed inhabitants.   Green eyes have lipochrome. This lipochrome (also known as feomelanin ) is a yellowish pigment. People with green eyes and especially those with amber coloured eyes have a lot of this yellow lipochrome inside their irises. Those with blue, brown or grey eyes usually don't have any lipochrome. When you have a lot of lipochrome inside your iris, you might have the amber eye colour. When you only have a small portion of this yellow pigment, your eyes might look a bit more green/blue-ish.  The combination of the yellow pigment and low amount of melanin gives rise to light green eyes. When you have a moderate amount of melanin but also lipochrome, your eyes probably look darker green. When you only have a low amount of melanin (and no lipochrome), your eyes look blue.   Light Green Eyes: (very) low amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blueish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + low amount of lipochrome   Yellowish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + (very) high amount of lipochrome   Dark Green Eyes : moderate amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Brownish Green Eyes : high amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blue Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Brown Eyes : (very) high amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Amber Eyes : (very) low melanin + very high amount of lipochrome  Grey Eyes : low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)     Heterochromia Iridum  Some people have a truly unique thing going on with their eyes: they have more than one colour! When one eye has a different colour than the other; it is called heterochromia iridum. When only a small portion of the iris has a different colour, it is called: partial heterochromia.      complete heterochromia: blue and green  Read for more information (Dutch): Green Eyes: a rare trait in humans     Geplaatst door    Jonrik A     op  10:46             Email This BlogThis!

I am glad you mentioned of an additional pigment, lipochrome, in green and amber eyes.  Most articles just assume that green eyes are caused by an intermediate amount melanin.  What exactly is lipochrome?  Does it have other names? One additional point you may want to clarify:  From what I've read elsewhere, for blue versus brown eyes, it's not just the amount of melanin but rather the location.  Both blue and brown eyes have melanin in the back of the iris, but only brown eyes have melanin in the stroma, the front layer of the iris.  That the location of melanin, and not just the amount, affects eye color makes intuitive sense, as there are people with dark blue eyes (high amount in back of iris, none in the stroma), and others with light brown eyes (moderate amounts in both back of iris and in stroma). Thank you for your article.  What source did you read that discussed the lipochrome - I can find very few articles mentioning it.

My brother is blonde with blue eyes and mine is brown with blue eyes. I was wondering if there is a layer of pigmentation under the first layer (the one everyone can see)? If you look up close to my eyes, I noticed that it appeared as if there was a second layer of pigmentation. I have my pupil and then green with black streaks. Then, I have my blue pigmentation with whitish streaks. To be honest, I don't know if my eyes are blue or grey. They only change to grey some times if I wear blue clothing. Also, the green layer is a dull green and when my pupil shrinks, the blue closes in, but the green doesn't appear to move. The green really looks like another layer. It's like oil and water trying to mix. They are right next to one another, but they aren't mixing and seem separate. Or a better example, when you poor gelatin onto colored paper. They don't mix, it just appears like the colored paper is a layer behind the gelatin. I've seen this is some pictures of eyes, but I don't know why it's like that. The blue seems to just, "disperse" you could say. Like, poring powdered lemonade into water, the powder sort of strings out (bad example).  My friend has partial heterochromia. She was born with blue eyes and they didn't turn to hazel until she was around 5. There is a dark brown splotch in one eye that makes her whole eye look dark brown from a distance. Why is it that her eye color didn't change for such a long period of time and produced the splotch? Delete Rebecca Cardenas 16 January 2016 at 10:46 My husband has awesome eyes like yours sound, except his have dark green, light green, yellow and Amber splotches that actually look red, then both his eyes have a different arrangement of these colors. One of his eyes has a lot more amber in it. Also what he wears seems to make them appear as different colors, lighting does and he emotions change the color too! When he is tired I swear his eyes turn dark green, when he is very angry they seen to sparkle with vibrant colors. I just have light brown eyes, two of our sons gave Brown eyes too, one has dark and the other light, only our middle sin has hazel Brown eyes, they look different with what he wears, lighting or his moods too. Your families eye colors seem very pretty especially yours. I am jealous, want to trade? I have always wanted gray, violet or very light green/bluish eyes. Beautiful colors!! Ps. Make sure you color coordinate some blouses, dresses, shoes, scarves, purses and make-up for those eyes of yours. Show the beauties off for those of us stuck with poo-poo eyes.

Most articles about the little girl say they are green. some say blue.  Could you let them know of this research in this article because it may narrow the search for the true birth mother and hopefully father of this child. thank you very much, please act on it, you could solve the mystery of this missing child.

Delete Shelly 27 September 2016 at 14:59 My eyes are "silver" (light grey and yellow) with a very dark grey limbal ring. My entire family has plain ol' steel blue eyes. If I could post a picture, I would. My son's dad's eyes are dark, dark brown. My son came out with Chestnut eyes- greenish outside and a reddish brown inside. Eye color is way more complicated than "mom has brown, dad has blue." We all carry 2 sets of genes and mutations happen along the way. It's definitely possible for 2 blue eyed parents to have a brown eyed child and vise versa. The genetic color possibility charts are online. You also have to remember that we aren't clones of our parents. Variations happen.

When I look in the mirror I see a starburst of gold round the pupil on a green background with a ring of dark blue around the Iris.  Have been told very often in brown eyed countries that they are beautiful.  Was once followed around a Turkish town by a carpet seller proclaiming 'your husband very lucky man!'

We don't know where it comes from as it is unique in our very large extended family. Might I ask your ethnicity? I have blue/silver eyes and my wife's are light brown (carrying recessive blue). Our eldest daughter has strikingly blue eyes, then our youngest has eyes like yours. My wife has French Canadian/English/Italian heredity and my family has not been able to find any information outside of the US. However, we can trace family in the US since the early 1600's.

I have a dk blue ring around the outside with the blue & yellow flashes that create the Hazel. My 13th GGrandfather was a direct desendant of Charlemagne. That makes me Charlemagne's 26th-30th GGrandson. Makes me wonder how many Monarchs had green eyes? Anony I I Delete Carmencita 29 October 2015 at 05:22 Hi Olessya, my eyes are similar although yours are amber-golden  and ice green while mine have a lighter yellow ring around the pupil and the rest of the iris is  dark blue-grey (making them appear green). So they are not true green actually but heterochromatic (not hazel either as there is no actual brown, just yellow and blue-grey). What is most unusual about your eyes is the shape of the amber ring, it's really thick and looks like a sunflower! So pretty! My eyes were blue-grey until I was twelve and my mom's were the same color until she was in her forties (my brother still has bue-grey eyes, while my dad and sister both have sky-blue eyes). We both came down with the same autoimmune thyroid disorder and grew yellow rings which changed our eye color. Even though I have been in remission since I was fourteen my eyes never changed back. It's interesting how health can affect eye color. Delete Unknown 20 November 2015 at 02:45 That's really pretty. I've been trying to find an eye colour similar to mine on the web and I can't see anything when it comes up with green eyes. I've got goldfish brown around the pupil and a greyish blue green basic and then a really dark navy outline it's strange.... Delete Unknown 5 March 2016 at 04:37 My eyes are very similar, except that they have an outer medium bluish ring.  They go from amber near the pupil to the overall color of green, and then have that bluish ring around the iris.  I have been told they are very beautiful.  One of my daughters has the same color eyes as me.  The oldest has blue/gray eyes, and the youngest has a dark version of mine and my middle daughters eyes.  Genes do funny things.

My eyes have been known to go from silver to dark blue and turquoise (but never green or hazel), but the only times I really see the dark gray is when I'm sick. I am of Irish descent, which was also kind enough to land me with freckles, curls & auburn hair (when I was a kid- it darkened to brown).

They have a dark green ring around the iris. The outer iris is emerald green and my inner iris, around the pupil, is a light brown in a starburst pattern with streaks of this ocher color. In direct light they look like they're glowing, but in normal light I've been told they resemble fractured crystal (people can't tell what color my eyes are sometimes because of the green and brown.) My friends are always shining lights in my eyes and asking me to look into the light so they can see my eyes XD Reply Delete jason docherty 18 March 2015 at 06:10 Hi would anyone care to tell me mine http://i62.tinypic.com/14jx40o.jpg Reply Delete Anonymous 18 March 2015 at 15:57 My left eye is gray and my right eye is blue with gray rings.

I have a pretty thick line of dark green (some days they look black) around my irises. Some days my eyes are greenish gold. Sometimes I have a gold-green ring around my pupil then a light green and then the dark green ring. I also have what I can only describe as scalloping (like an icing pattern on the side of a birthday cake) most days. The scalloping is a lighter green that makes a ring that's kinda bent but still connected, it's hard to describe. I have huge pupils that make me look like an alien, they are bigger or smaller depending on light, day and time of day. They take up most of my eye some days.

My eyes change from light green to golden green depending on the amount of light. My dad also has green eyes but they are a really dark green and my mom has very light blue eyes so i guess that explains the yellow green that i have.. I just created a pof profile today and didn't know what to write down for my eye color and tried to figure what hazel is because it is written on my drivers license. I do have a bit brown in them but you have to look very closely to spot it so that is what kinda throws me off in trying to figure out if they are hazel or green. I could say they are 10 percent brown 30 percent yellow and 60 percent green. Reply Delete Anonymous 8 June 2015 at 01:26 Hi, interesting article, though as a green-eyed, dark-haired AFRICAN lady I disagree with the the following statement.  "Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared". In South Africa and Namibia especially, light coloured eyes are not that rare at all, in both countries there are so may different races/ethnic groups in Namibia there are at least 11 major groups.  In the Baster community in Rehoboth you'll find a lot of light-eyed people with light hair, red hair is is not that rare as well. Their ancestors were mainly of Dutch and German origin, my great-grandfather was Irish. In my family from my father's side, close and extended most have blue, green eyes.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

It has been estimated that only 2% of the world’s population have true green eyes. To give you an idea of just how special green eyes are, consider this factoid. Currently, it is estimated that around 7 billion people live on the planet. Going by the math, this means only 140 million people have some shade of green as an eye color. There are only a handful of celebrities who have green eyes and even a smaller number who are male. If you are one of these people – consider yourself lucky.    FYI: green eyes can express in several shades, including hazel, emerald, jade and blue-green. In super rare cases, they can even appear amber. When you take into account the different variations of this color, including some people with hues of brown, the number of people who can be classified as having green eyes jumps from 2% to 8%. MOST ATTRACTIVE EYE COLOR Guy Counseling recently asked nearly 90,000 website visitors which eye color they considered most attractive (as of 7/4/17). Here are the responses, broken down for each by percentages.

Other information about various shades of green eye color will be touched upon, including popular hues. Are you ready? Let’s jump right in! What is the science of Green Eyes? Male Green Eyes WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF GREEN EYES? Many people want to know where green eyes come from. Ultimately, eye color is a function of genetics and is determined by two factors: (1) the pigmentation of the iris and (2) the way light scatters around the iris itself. Let’s take a quick look at both. Pigmentation of a person’s iris can run the gamut from the darkest color, black to lightest, blue. Largely influencing pigmentation is something called melanin , a complex polymer made from the amino acid tyrosine. The appearance of green and shades of green (i.e. jade, hazel eyes and emerald) are the result of a  phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering; which is a 25 cent term used to describe the way light scatters after riding its spectrum wavelength. Most people mistakenly believe that colors like green and blue are in the iris – but they’re not. Your eye color is a function of how light diffuses across the melanin base, which again is genetically determined. Credit: Wiki Commons GREEN EYES: ORIGINS AND GENES Old theory Prior to 2008, scientists thought eye color was determined by one dominant gene. It was postulated that an eye color hierarchy existed with brown being at the top of the ladder and blue resting at the bottom. Under the old way of thinking, this meant if your dad had brown eyes and your mom had blue eyes, you would likely be born with brown colored eyes. A parental combination of two green eyes would translate into you having green eyes. Recessive genes were also thought to partially influence eye color. New theory New research, presented in a 2008 publication of the American Journal of Human Genetics washed the old way of thinking about eyes and color. The new research suggests that as many as 16 genes may influence the way color is expressed in the iris. The unscientific translation means that a baby can be born with just about any eye color, regardless of what their parents have. It is important to note, however, that hereditary variables need to be factored into the equation. The video below offers an excellent scientific analysis of how people get different color eyes, including green, blue, brown, hazel and some rare variations. GENETIC PREVALENCE OF GREEN EYES Interestingly enough, there are anthropological records of early humans with green eyes living around the mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area contained a natural land bridge between Europe and Asia. Knowns as the “Silk Route” or “Silk Roads”; this ancient passageway was used by early civilizations for the lucrative trade silk, sometimes between 120 BCE – 1450s CE (Yao, et all, 2000). The silk route is thought to be a major reason for the distribution of green eyes WHERE DO GREEN EYES COME FROM? We know from history that Silk Road played an important role in the creation of the civilizations of China, the Goguryeo kingdom in Korea, much of Japan, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Persia and the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Because it served as a significant trade route for many early traders, it is thought that mating between various groups may have been part of gene distribution. This may help to explain why green eyes can be found in various groups across Europe, Africa and Asia. GENETIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND EYE COLOR Genetic anthropology is growing branch of science that examines DNA testing with concrete archaeological, historical and language-based evidence to uncover the history of ancient migration patterns in early human civilizations. Thanks to this emerging area of research, scientists are learning more and more about the etiology of eye color. This is why today, you can have your DNA tested to determine your genetic background. In turn, this may help to explain the genetic reasons for your ocular hue. GREEN EYES AND GEOLOGIC TIME Much of Europe, Asia and Africa and large swaths of the middle east have been native lands to people with green eyes for centuries. When studying the geologic time scale; a tool used to measure our planets history, it is thought that green eyes may have appeared in people of Iranian, Spanish, Brazilian and Pakistani decent sometime during the late part of the Cenozoic period . Specifically, this would be between the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs some 2 to 3 million years ago.  Any race, including people who are Caucasian, Asian, African, Native Indian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and pre-Colombians (Indigenous Peoples of the Americas) can have green colored eyes. Anthropologists believe eye color, like hazel, blue, brown and green, are the direct result of migratory behaviors. Because of inter-mixing of groups, coupled with thousands of genetic mutations, we see various shades of green throughout modern man. Jessee Metcalfe has green eyes.

Many people are curious if eye color can change. The answer is – absolutely! People with green, blue or brown eyes all experience change in color from time to time. Causes for eye color changes include: The way light scatters Mood Health/Medical reasons HOW EYE COLOR CAN CHANGE DUE TO HEALTH The color of your iris can permanently change if you have glaucoma and take certain medications for treatment. If you have light colored eyes and want to keep them, you need to be extremely careful with the glaucoma medications you take. Make sure you consult with your eye doctor to discover all of the facts. Other reasons eye color can change to certain types of diseases. Examples include Horner’s syndrome and Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis. Should you notice any changes in the color of your eyes, contact your doctor immediately. Green eyes of Tom Welling: Credit insoonia.com GREEN EYES AND HEALTH RISKS If you have green eyes, you are more susceptible to the sun’s harmful radiation. This has to do with our old friend melanin previously mentioned. Simply put, green eyed people can develop certain types of ocular cancers, like intraocular melanoma . People with light colored eyes should wear UV protective sunglasses when outdoors. Jensen Ackles has light green eyes: Credit Fanpop PHENOMENON OF RAYLEIGH SCATTERING As mentioned previously, green eyes, blue eyes and brown eyes do not actually have these colors deposited into the iris. In truth, your eye pigmentation has a little brown in them. Because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, your eyes will reflect back a certain colored hue. Green eyes can come in different shades Green eyes with gold specs of Eddie Redmaybe HOW LIGHT CHANGES EYE COLOR Using the prior mentioned scientific principle of Rayleigh scattering, transformation of light particles that land on the iris will impact its coloristic appearance. This can result in a person having hazel, amber, jade, emerald, blue and even gray! Other factors can influence the shade of green in eyes. Lighting: Artificial lighting (aka: light bulbs) can impact how eye color is experienced. The intensity of the light hitting your iris will either amplify or soften your iris’s appearance.  Time of day: Light from the sun may be more intense earlier in the day or later, which means your iris will “pick-up” different intensities from the solar spectrum .  Reflective colors: The color of everything around you, including the cloths you have on, can intensify how eye color is experienced. Certain colors, like gold, blue and other greens can amplify the flecks reflecting outward from your Iris.  Makeup: Some people wear eye-makeup, like gold and purple eye-shadow, to accentuate the natural green of the iris. This can cause the desired effect of having chameleon eyes.  Gorgeous makeup makes a line of eye shadow specifically designed for people with green eye color. Allergies: Some people with allergies have “scratchy eyes” which can cause the surrounding “whites” of the eyes to become red (aka: bloodshot eyes). This can have the effect of amplifying your eye color and creating baggy eyes.Most people do not desire this look.  Emotional state: While your emotional state does not directly change the color of your eyes, what you are feeling at any given point in time can impact how they are perceived. Specifically, if you are depressed and crying, your pupil may dilate, which may give off a darker appearance.  Substances: Use of alcohol, uppers, downers and other kinds of medications can cause your pupils to become larger or smaller. The end result can mean your eye color becomes more intense. Josh Henderson has a green eye and blue eye because of heterochromia. HETEROCHROMIA Some people have a condition called heterochromia that causes one eye to be one color (like green) and the other eye to be a different color (like blue). While multiple causes have been suggested, the current scientific thinking suggests that a lack of genetic diversity is the main reason for heterochromia. It is thought that the condition is caused by a mutation of the genes determining melanin distribution, which often becomes changed due to chromosomal homogeneity. The photograph above of actor Josh Henderson is an example of someone with heterochromia. Notice one of his eyes are green. The other is blue. Very rare and unique. NOTE OF CAUTION If your eye color changes suddenly or if you notice your pupils remain dilated for no apparent reason for an extended period of time, contact your physician immediately. Your eyes are not something you want to play with. What Do Your Eyes Say About You Video Channing Tatum has a unique pair of green eyes that are almost jade. MALE CELEBRITIES WITH GREEN EYES There are many celebrities with green eyes – so many that it is not possible to list them all here. Bear in mind that different people have different hues of green. How they are expressed and perceived by others in large part depends on the factor previously mentioned.  Listed below are a number of male celebrities with green eyes. Jesse Metcalfe Channing Tatum Jude Law Casey Affleck David Beckham Drew Fuller Harrison Ford Jack Nicholson Jon Hamm Matt Dallas Oliver Martinez Paul Rudd Robbie Williams Tom Cruise Tom Welling Willie Aames Vincent Perez Van Johnson MYTHS ABOUT GREEN EYES Green eyes are indeed rare and therefore desired by many. Because of this, it makes sense that a number of myths exist about people with green eyes. What follows are a few of the “biggies”. Green, hazel and amber all in one! Keep in mind there are many more than the ones listed here! Green eyed people are more attractive. Green eyed people possess supernatural powers. Green eyed people have more intense relationships. Green eyed people are better in bed. Green eyed people live healthier life styles Green eyed people are more connected to the earth Green eyed people live longer PERSONALITY TRAITS OF GREEN EYED PEOPLE Do people with green eyes have specific personality traits? Many people wonder about this question. The truth is, we don’t really know. But if you were to ask a person with this shade of color, they’re like to say: Green eyed people are outgoing People with green eyes are extroverted Men with green eyes are natural born inventors Women with green are are empathic Green eyes are a sign of inner strength Individuals with shades of green are intuitive Loyalty is a strong green eyes trait Some people with green eyes are highly jealous Passion is a natural trait among green eyes people The greener the eyes, the fitter the person Men with light green eyes are naturally funny Women with dark green eyes are naturally charming GREEN EYE POLL This poll is designed to find out what you think about eye color. It is not scientific and therefore should be used for entertainment purposes only. Still, the results may give you a clue about what others think about eye color – including the color of your eyes! Your self-esteem should not be tied to your eye color – keep this in mind when you take the poll. Use this link to access the quick survey . Your response is completely confidential. DID GREEN EYES COME FROM ALIENS? The color of your eyes is unique. No two people have exactly the same eye color, unless they are identical twins. When we examine the origins of eye color, we can see their evolution changed over the course of time. It has been postulated that adaptations in eye color occurred as a result of a changing environment. Some people believe green eyes and blue eyes are the result of an alien species depositing their DNA into the human genome.  But if you look at other species on our planet, you will see eye colors come in rainbow, including oranges, reds and yellows. Did these differing ocular colors come from aliens as well? FINAL THOUGHTS ON GREEN EYES We are still learning a great deal about eye color with new research happening every day. There have also been advancements changing eye color of the iris through medical procedures . And of course, you can always buy colored contacts to make your eyes blue green , hazel or brown!

John Michael  says:   December 14, 2015 at 12:00 am  Thats interesting because I have blond hair and green eyes being the only one in my family. I am a male and have retained these colours all my life. Would these same Iranians be from the area where the ancient civilisation of Media once stood?

But I wasn’t.  Really!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 4, 2015 at 8:30 pm  Same here, i feel like in the wrong place   belaboa9  says:   November 4, 2015 at 11:53 pm  Are you the only one with green eyes too?  At least I can fall back on the fact that I’m 3/4 Irish!  All the boys in my family have blue eyes, and all the girls have brown or hazel.  I feel like an oddball!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 4:43 pm  Yes, among my large family (grandma, uncles, cousins, etc) I am the only one with green eyes. Well, my bio dad has green eyes, but my mum is a single mother, so I barely know him. But it’s not just about the eye colour, it’s something more, like behaviour, it’s strange o:   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 7:52 pm  Are you the black sheep of the family?  I am.  I’m considered the “weird” one because I’m the smartest, most creative, adventurous, risk-taking and mystical one.  I follow my own path no matter what anyone else says.  And I have snakes! LOL  And two rescue dogs.   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 10:14 pm  Kinda, well, i do not consider myself that smart, but i tell you that my family doesn’t even get jokes from the simpsons 😐   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 11:07 pm  Bummer.  So how is your behaviour different from the rest of your family’s?   Alejandro Ontiveroz  says:   February 10, 2016 at 8:02 pm  I have green eyes too and so does my sister. I guess it is because my dad has vary light blue eyes and my mom has semi dark brown eyes. I only know 3 people with green eyes. But i don’t think im very attractive. Im a male and i have girl like features. And i have long hair.   belaboa9  says:   February 11, 2016 at 6:36 pm  Yeah, but how old are you?  Most guys aren’t their handsomest until they’re 35-40 years old!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:56 pm  yep that would be me too. But have no dogs, love snakes, never had them as pets though.   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:53 pm  EVERYONE has blue eyes! No other colors at all just Blue! Even Aunts an Cousins sea of blue eyes!   belaboa9  says:   June 24, 2016 at 8:39 pm  Like I said to someone else, it must be a really recessive gene that decided to resurface, unless we are adopted, or our daddies aren’t really our daddies!  OMG!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:54 pm  I know just how you feel. 🙂   marley  says:   July 29, 2017 at 2:56 pm  I have pure green light eyes that for some reason sparkle   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 1:48 am  I also am the only green eye person in my family. Both parents, and all siblings have blue eyes. Also, all blood relations on both sides have blue eyes. Not one brown eye, and I’m the one green eye. It’s always bothered me!   belaboa9  says:   June 22, 2016 at 2:12 pm  Me, too!  I’ve always wondered how many generations back in my family I would have to go, to find another green-eyed person.  It’s got to come from the Irish side, or maybe there’s a little bit of gypsy on the Italian side!  In any case, I’ll never know!   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:52 pm  In Nursing School I was told eye color only comes from parents. I’ve wondered about my paternity every since. I am the odd ball! Not just eye color either. To chicken to ask. Lol My mother said IT WAS THE EVIL COMING OUT IN ME when I mentioned it once! Don’t know if that was joke, but I never mentioned it again   belaboa9  says:   June 23, 2016 at 1:22 am  LOL!  I learned the same thing in Nursing School!  That’s why I always thought I was adopted.  But I wasn’t.  I’ve got my birth certificate, and all my baby pictures are in the family albums!  It must be a really recessive gene which has resurfaced! ????  Lucky for us!   Shannon Mullis-Long  says:   October 6, 2015 at 9:31 am  Myself and three cousins have green eyes. My mother has brown my father blue. Mine are constantly changing from blue green to emerald green to grey. No two days are the same and sometimes changing twice or three times a day.   Luke  says:   October 24, 2015 at 6:08 am  I have green eyes and have been told more than once that my eyes look good.   Fred E Rick  says:   October 31, 2015 at 10:14 pm  I have green eyes.

Actually one green, the other one is slightly brown. Not so noticeable fortunately ????   Glen  says:   December 12, 2015 at 9:20 pm  I had blue eyes as a child, which was odd at the time as both my mother and father has brown, (I also had blonde hair as a child but now it is dark brown) I’m 35 now and my eye’s are now a deep shade of green and have been since a young age, I am the youngest of 4 and the only other person in my immediate family with green eyes is my eldest brother. I wasn’t aware green eyes were considered rare.   Tucker  says:   March 21, 2017 at 6:00 pm  I had blue eyes as a young child but they turned to green before my teens.   John Michael  says:   December 13, 2015 at 11:55 pm  I am a male and have blond hair and 1 green lighter eye and 1 green darker eye. I wonder what the percentages for this is? I am also the only one in my family with it and I thought I was adopted. So I did check with the hospital and I’m legit. Lol. Use to feel a bit freakish because there a so few of us. Now I know I’m blessed!   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:47 am  I have very light yellow green eyes with blue around the rim. How does that factor into the green eyed equation? I know that it does come from the Italian side og my family, with only one member of each genation having this particular eye coloe.   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:50 am  Oh, and I not only have a very unusual eye color (only one in my family) but am lefy-handed as well (again the only one in my family). I probably would have been burned at the stake in Salem as a witch. Ha!   Pavel Sivi  says:   February 23, 2016 at 9:42 am  all my famly has different kinds of green eyes. but mine are strange they sometimes seem to be blue and sometimes green. depends on the light. but as far as i see they are green   Karen Denning  says:   April 6, 2016 at 4:49 pm  What is it about green eyes that catches people’s attention? It makes me feel uneasy when I notice someone staring at my eyes. From my perspective I seem to be hyper sensitive to light compared to most people. I squint a lot which gives others the impression that I’m mad or something. LOL   Eric Weeber  says:   June 18, 2016 at 4:51 pm  i know the feeling with that one..mine are light to mid green and i have always squinted alot due to light.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:37 pm  I think in my life about 2 people have commented on my eye colour!  But agree about the light although mine are darker than a lot of blue-eyed folk, I think.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f684a4b7e1174fe4f3923947702156e9b71123bc1fb2577d471e9b9b7a1d0a3.jpg   Rebecca A  says:   December 18, 2016 at 11:29 am  I very light sensitive eyes.

Every eye has it’s own and special shade that makes them beautiful in its way! Yours sure are too! 😀   Nicole Lovelace  says:   September 1, 2016 at 9:25 pm  That’s not true, green is a beautiful color. Even if they weren’t rare, they would still be a popular eye color.   Carla  says:   September 6, 2016 at 6:42 pm  Indeed, but I’m not talking about preference but about rareness. Think about it… If 90% of the population had green eyes and only 10% had, for example, brown eyes, which color would be more desired… green or brown? I honestly think that it’s more a matter of exclusiveness than color. And please don’t think that I’m saying this beacause I don’t love my eye color or something. I actually do have green eyes, I just don’t like when people compare themselves with others, just because they don’t have what those people do have and don’t feel special because of it. If that even makes sense… :S xD (Sorry if I’m a little off with my writing skills, not my mother tongue xD, And sorry too for that unnecessary large reply xD)   Michele Kasel  says:   April 29, 2016 at 11:13 pm  i have green eyes and if i wear violet-blue contact lenses they look cool!   i also have brown contacts–i guess i get sorta bored with the same color eyes for 50 years LOL   Gabbyy Fratt  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:33 pm  I have green eyes but if u look close they have a little bit of light brown in the middle then blue all around the rest but farther away they r bright green it’s rlly weird   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:50 pm  This only means that you have some shade of hazel eyes. Half brown, half green, and sometimes some blue too!   hunter  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:36 pm  i have green eyes and my parent have them to and my brother and sister and all my other family members have them to   Ann  says:   July 26, 2016 at 6:26 pm  Same with me, except I don’t know about extended family.   Tyler Karl Lia  says:   May 18, 2016 at 3:03 am  Would have like the article, but the mixed race bastards who have my eyes ruined it.

Pretty sure in the case of eyes it only Parents not like Hair color or skin! Not sure why!   Deborah Wilbourn  says:   May 24, 2016 at 12:07 am  I’m the middle child of 5 children both father and mother have brown eyes older brother blue eyes older sister younger sister and younger brother all have brown eyes. As far back as I can trace  in family history mostly blue eyes and brown eyes going back to my great grandparents none with green eyes can be found.  I do have one daughter with green eyes the other with blue, their dad has blue eyes. This article I read has a lot of information that is true for me and the trait of having green eyes, however I do believe there is much more information missing due to my age and experience.   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:35 pm  There goes my Mendel Pundit square argument Big B little b times Big B little b gets 2 Brown eyes BB 50!per cent blue eyes Little b little b All that is down the tubes   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:37 pm  My father brown eyes My mother blue 2 dark eyed sister 2 blue eyed( I’m considered blue but I’m green)   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm  As long as you have a brown eyed parent they whole all eye color genes. A brown eye parent can have any eye color child from how I understood it in school   Denis St  says:   June 14, 2016 at 5:23 pm  What should I say… My eyes turned from light blue to grassy/olive green in 8-9th grade, one of my eye corner has a little part of light blue, but hardly noticeable (unless you pay close attention) my hair from ginger turned to the darkest brown/black then it turned into almost dirty blonde color..   Beth  says:   June 16, 2016 at 2:33 am  Eye color doesn’t run the “gambit,” people. It runs the “gamut.” A gamut is a scale; a gambit is a chess move, or other scheme.

I was told I was born with sky blue eyes but they changed color when I was 8-9 month old to green.  All the members of my bio father have green eyes and his father as well.  All my mother’s have brown except for her great grandmma who had blue.  Im older now and notice my eye color is changing to more blue than green, I don’t like that!  And never knew they were rare??  I went to grammar school in small town in central Mexico.  Out of a class of about 25, 6 kids had green eyes, WTH??  And I never knew why I was sensitiv to bright light and I hate the sun!!  I was freaked to learn in the poll, I am Latino, a Scorpio and other traits I can relate to LoL!  Thx   BTDTGTTS  says:   August 16, 2016 at 3:29 pm  My husband has one blue and one green eye.  I have pale grey blue eyes.  My son has brilliant blue eyes with a dark ring around them and a few yellow specks.  My daughter has soft green eyes with a dark ring and yellow specks.  I love all their eye colors and just wish mine weren’t so wishy washy grey blue.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:38 pm  grey-blue is a great eye colour!   David  says:   August 17, 2016 at 9:18 am  I have green eyes which are very sensitive to light or even a breeze (especially a winter one). I used to get compliments about my eyes when I was younger but not so much now. 🙁 I like the fact that they are a rare trait.   Gulfidan  says:   September 8, 2016 at 5:25 pm  Well I do have very different green eye color most people they don’t believe it is my regular color???? I am Turkish and no one in my family have my eye color! When I cry it turns to bright green when I go out sunny day turns to yellow when I am angry dark green????

OlivierDMG  says:   September 10, 2016 at 6:31 pm  yup people notice my eyes and start to tell me how beautiful they are, sometimes it’s just weird.   ahls  says:   September 11, 2016 at 3:26 pm  I used to have brown eyes, here is my video what i did to change it to hazel green  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOe00BkUbjE   Tonia Gleaton  says:   September 27, 2016 at 1:16 pm  NO Green eyes on my mothers side of the family they are all BLUE or BROWN on my Dad’s side BLUE,BROWN a,small % of GREEN eyes,  I am one of those with the GREEN eyes and always been very proud of them for sure. I have a sister with HAZEL eyes but her eyes have more BROWN then GREEN in them but they are still beautiful, my brother her TWIN has CRYSTAL BLUE eyes. I am working on our genealogy and had a gathering this summer of cousins and family that I had never met but it AMAZED me that 90% and that maybe LOW!!! They were GREEN eyed it was varies shades but they were GREEN eyed . I have never seen that many GREEN eyed people in one place it was AWESOME   Americkan  says:   October 23, 2016 at 3:36 pm  I have very green eyes and very fair skin,when I was born and until about four my hair was white,then went to blond,then light brown. At the ripe age of 35 my hair went from light brown right back to white/silver. My eye color however remained green. My parents and 4siblings do not have green eyes, only me. Until recently I never gave my eye color much thought but now I think I’m just a little unique.   Di  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:03 pm  I have green eyes and thought it was a common color, maybe not.   Hamza Asghar Khan  says:   November 5, 2016 at 3:39 am  My Eyes are extremely dark.. I sometimes wonder if they are even green or not… 😛 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2e2d37bb1417410beeebff175db2f1902155e33dcbd96f167797f8c349dd0df5.jpg   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:33 pm  yup, definitely green!   Wanza Good  says:   November 30, 2016 at 1:49 am  Looks kind of like a mixture of mostly grey with some green.

My mother said when I was born my eyes were so blue they looked purple and stayed that way for 3 years. Now people don’t believe I’m not wearing contacts. It’s creepy for me. I can’t even look people in the face directly   Bedra Ogdee  says:   June 21, 2017 at 5:40 pm  My eyes are also green. My mother said that when I was born they were so blue that they looked purple and my hair was jet black. I am of Lebanese and Hispanic descent. I am the only one in the family including my fathers side and my mothers side. None of my cousins on either side. I do get many compliments and sometimes I get very embarrassed. I am proud to know that green eyes are rare.   Meryl Burke  says:   January 4, 2017 at 4:47 am  Dr. John Moore, Fun article but I’ve got to let you know for some reason hue was spelled incorrectly as hew. Thanks, Truly, green eyes.   John D. Moore  says:   January 4, 2017 at 9:02 am  Thanks, I’ll correct!   Rinny  says:   January 14, 2017 at 4:02 pm  I do not believe green eyes are rare. I know many many people with green eyes.

EbonyIvoryRose  says:   January 25, 2017 at 9:11 pm  I’m the only one in my whole family that has green eyes, as far as i know. It’s pretty funny actually, I’m completely the odd one out as the only green eyed person amongst all brown eyes.   Shadowpaw  says:   February 12, 2017 at 3:30 pm  I  have light greenish yellow eyes, chartreuse colored.  I have night blindness to some degree and my eyes are slightly light sensitive My hair is blondish red naturally. When i get mad some people have told me that my eyes flash, which i have never seen but i have been told this by numerous people.  Some people don’t like me to stare at them because they say it’s spooky.  Lol ! .   BeltedFool  says:   February 23, 2017 at 5:12 am  Is my eyes green? I wonder if they are hazel!??!?!

My optician said that they are more sensitive to light. I have to were sunglasses or I get bad headaches in bright sunshine. I seem to be able to see in the dark better than anyone I know. I have red hair too. I am the only one in my whole family with green eyes. The others are blue or brown.   ART emis  says:   March 21, 2017 at 12:50 pm  I have green eyes ,too! People often tell me that I have extremeley beautiful eyes…..I know people who have green eyes but are “pale” and I dont really like them.I think my eyes would be better if they were a darker shade of green ,but I haven’t any problem………..I think they look nice this is an old photo of me (a years ago)  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f84bce406aab07c4f0c6c856dd2c568adb49d854407e8a11e8a6075641855592.png   Sonya Marlene Tanner  says:   April 11, 2017 at 6:15 pm  Green or hazel?

I have a small amount of amber around my iris. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cc002c227ea46608f17fab5f2fd2f232944bb735e5b4e0065d82bb965e7067cf.png   Holly DeAnna Moore  says:   April 12, 2017 at 1:31 am  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/01d9f95c88d59da81daf67f758c43d98ff565d8a748c710c92d2425239d2b987.jpg Born with deep blue eyes but they changed to green when I was around 8 years old.   Kimberly Shand  says:   April 18, 2017 at 8:07 pm  Well, now I know why people always freak out when they realize I have green: They think I possess powers, or was influenced by an alien. Seriously? Why don’t they just burn me at the stake?   Michael  says:   April 28, 2017 at 7:39 am  i actually can’t even tell tbh seem green in someways but also brown, i’ve had people tell me green, hazel, brown i have no idea top picture is with flash bottom without flash it’s hard to make sure my pupils aren’t dilated seem to need lot’s of light or my eyes be mostly the black dot  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b3d27e393812440bf1e9d0ec766aa0f745133a90f1e6851818a480886ffea6ab.jpg  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bd66c80b062e84b9c0324ba7e176e33593bb1f39765e8d31e7f75b67f0566e29.jpg   Fred Krueger  says:   May 1, 2017 at 12:18 am  I have green eyes. I didn’t understand how special it was until I read this article.  Now I feel like the chosen one. Maybe I belong on another planet ?   For the Love of Purple  says:   May 3, 2017 at 3:09 am  Interesting I am A- and I have deep green eyes that change colours between ‘gold’ ‘blue’ or ‘Hazel’  depending on the colour of clothing I wear or the eye makeup I apply.  I have been told that my eyes are both intense and unnerving on many occasions throughout my life.  What is interesting to myself, is that I can meet someone look, into their eyes and instantly within a millisecond know whether they are a friend or foe…   Brandy Grote  says:   June 5, 2017 at 6:03 pm  Glad to know it isn’t DNA based!  Dad has lovely mahogany eyes, Mom has pale jade green eyes.  (Both brothers have the same brown as Dad.) Mine were deep blue as a young child, going turquoise, then changing from blue to green based on my strong emotions as a young adult.  Now they are nearly always green, with some blue tint that gets more or less each day. Hair is light amber brown.   Holly Rodriguez  says:   July 17, 2017 at 7:19 am  I am hispanic, my great grandparents were basque people of spain.

Italy is heavily influenced by the entire Mediterranean with many people who have lighter color eyes.   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:39 pm  so Italian people most likely have light eyes because I am full Italian like my mom and dad are both itailan   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:37 pm  I am the only one with green eyes in my family but my grandpa on my moms side has like blue and green eyes. But my two brothers have hazels eyes that sometimes turn like dark blue with brown around the blue. Comments are closed.

Animated video shows the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

Bookmark Discussion cassychavarria wrote: Ok so my husband and i both have brown eyes, but in my family my dad has hazel his mother (my grandmother) has green eyes, her father (my great grandfather) had Bright blue eyes, My oldest brother has green eyes, my second oldest brother has blue eyes, my youngest brother has hazel eyes, and my cousin which is my dads sisters daughter has gray eyes . My husband just has brown eyes that runs in his side of the family . What are the chances of my baby having colored eyes ? Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  7 Posts h  hjawwad15 Probably very small chances of anything other than brown. I have blue eyes and my husband has brown. I am pretty sure our baby will just have brown eyes. Brown is pretty dominant and with your husband having only brown eyed parents, I don't think its likely recessive genes like colored eyes will show up over that. But there's a chance you could be surprised! I'm sure your baby will be adorable no matter what :) Reply  Close M  Miramarsol My brother sent me a video of different percentages. Here are the screenshots I took. My dad has beautiful green/blue eyes.his grandpa had blue eyes. My husbands great grandpa had green eyes, but my husband and I have brown eyes so we think the percentage is low Reply  Close M  Miramarsol Reply  Close M  Miramarsol Reply  Close M  Miramarsol Reply  Close c  ceis15 Your husband would also have to have light eyes somewhere in his family, which could be in there without knowing.  light eyes are recessive, so your baby would have to get the recessive gene from both you and your husband that's why the chances are so low.  It could happen though.  Everyone in my family has blue or green but mine are hazel.  My husband and his mother have dark brown, but he doesn't know his family beyond that and he is always saying how Dominican people are a combination of Native, West African, and Spanish, so you never know what you're going to get.  Well our son is almost a year old and his eyes are still blue!!

Thanks everyone :) just for fun Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  34 Posts a  ataylor036 @mamataylor14  I'm not good at the hair. But do either of your grandparents have blue eyes? If not you child should have brown eyes. If either one of your grandparents passed a recessive trait for blue eyes down to your parents your baby could have a 50/50 chance between brown or blue eyes. m  mamataylor14 @ataylor036  My paternal grandfather has blue eyes and my maternal grandmother has blue eyes and both of his grandparents have blue c  crazylove_bells This is so fun...I could make a guess, but it would probably have no scientific significance lol!  My husband is 1/2 Filipino- dark features and brown eyes... and I'm a blondie with green eyes...our baby came out blond at first lol!  She now has very light brown hair and kept her BLUE eyes! Beautiful with almond shaped eyes :) Ok my guess for your baby...dirty blonde hair with blue eyes! You'll have to keep us updated once baby arrives :) m  mamataylor14 @crazylove_bells  That's awesome! I bet she's beautiful! A friend of mine is African American and her baby came out with bright icy blue eyes! Crazy :) and so pretty! j  jlyons02 Punnett square.. you have to line up you and your DH, but you need to know what traits are dominant and what's recessive.. I know green eyes are recessive so I have 2 recessive genes, and my SO has brown eyes, which is dominant, so our baby will most likely have brown eyes, unless my SO has 1 dominant brown trait and one recessive green, in which case there is 1/4 chance of green eyes. z  zmomma2 I have no idea. But I'm a red head and everyone told me there was no way id get my red headed baby because the gene is so recessive. Well, my girl has a head full of bright red curly hair!! She also has daddy's big brown eyes, which is a rare combination :) She's a pretty even split between all of our features, so I'm curious about number 2! b  blessedmomma12 @mamataylor14  I'm brown/brown and DH is brown/hazel. Our DD has beautiful dark auburn/red hair and blue eyes! Dark eyelashes unlike many lighter red heads. Never would've guessed we'd get a red head bc no parents/grandparents. A couple random great aunts/uncles apparently had red. We love our sweet surprise! G  GiraffeGirl Bb/BB = Brown eyes always bb= Blue Eyes always a person with bb can only produce gametes with "b" a person with BB can only produce gametes with "B" a person with Bb produces gametes with "B" OR "b"  your DH can only produce "b", so your child definitely has at least one "b" i believe that you having hazel eyes is the same genetically as having blue eyes, therefore you only produce "b" as well, which means that your parents are each Bb. so....you are having a blue eyed little one :) k  kwitt318 I think... blue eyes are recessive gene. However with that many you may end up with a blue eyed babe! I believe curly is recessive too, so unless you had curly its unlikely babe will have curly!  I would aim to guess brown hair, but its just a guess! G  GiraffeGirl @GiraffeGirl  to correct myself a bit...genetics refer to "light" and "dark" eyes.  If your eyes are light, you are having a blue eyed baby.  I know people who call their eyes "hazel" but they are really brown. j  jennigiddi @mamataylor14  I don't know the whole dominant recessive thing but I can tell you what I have. I have brown hair now, blonde as a child and hazel eyes. My mom had hazel my dad blue. My husband is 1/2 Japanese so he has dark hair brown eyes. His dad had blue. Our 3 oldest all ended up with blonde hair blue eyes. I do expect their hair to darken through the years. My youngest ended up with the brown eyes and dark hair. Kind of curious to see what this one ends up having. I would've liked 1 to get my eyes. :) c  candicel125 My husband is blue, I'm brown. All 3 of our boys are blue :) m  mamataylor14 These are what I call hazel haha they seem light to me so maybe these with my DG blue eyes we will have a blue eyes girl! :) H  Haleigh4512 Ok mines crazy difficult. Lol My family : grandpa and grandma( maternal ) have blue eyes. Grandma and grandpa (paternal) brown. My mom has green and my dad has brown. I have blue. Hubbys: i have no idea on grandparents (his paternal are 100%Germanic if that helps), his mom has brown his dad has blue and my hubby has brown. So i have no guesses. Lol m  mamataylor14 @jennigiddi  That's so fun! I guess you just never know until they come :)) G  GiraffeGirl @mamataylor14  what beautiful eye balls you have!!!  :)) i would say they are brown from a genetic standpoint....so, you have at least one "B".  you could have a "b" and therefore a blue eyed LO, otherwise, s/he will be "Bb" and beautifuly brown eyed.  :) s  svtbaby Is this applicable to just color of eyes/hair or even kind of hair like curly, wavy or straight? Or shape of the eyes like tiny or big? G  GiraffeGirl @Haleigh4512  you bring a "bb" to the scene and your hubby brings "Bb"...so you have a 50% chance of brown, 50% chance of blue. n  nymommyof3 I have hazel green eyes and brown curly hair.

I have brown eyes, my mom has brown eyes, my dad has blue eyes (I am represented by the top row). Husband has greenish eyes (just called them green), his mom has greenish eyes. His dad has blue eyes. He is represented on the left hand side. Brown is dominant, blue is recessive, and I actually think green is recessive as well, but I'm pretty sure it's also a mix of blue and something else. Eyes are weird. So! My results read: Brown (dominant over green) Blue green (I'd consider that green) Brown (dominant over blue) Blue blue (just blue!) I think we have a 50% chance of a brown eyes baby, a 25% chance of a blue eyed baby, and a 25% chance of a green eyed (or more complicated color) baby. Moms who did genetics or anything similar in college and can remember how eye color works, can you check my work? It's been waaaaaaaay too long. Lol Reply  Close s  sarahholl9986 Yeah I'm adopted so I know nothing about my parents eye colors just his! Reply  Close m  mom_wife_4life My husband has brown eyes (like dark dark brown) and I have blue eyes. Our first daughter has blue eyes like me and our 2nd daughter has green eyes like my husbands mom. I for sure thought both my girls would get brown eyes bc I'm the only blue eyed in my family other than my dad (everyone else has brown eyes) and then of course my husband has dark brown eyes so I was for sure our kids would get dark eyes. But nope, they got light eyes. So I'm expecting this one to have light eyes as well since our other 2 got the light eye genes. But honestly, anything can happen since there are blue, brown, and green eyes in the family. So basically what I'm saying, is you just never know. Lol Reply  Close B  BabyGarblet Blue eyed dad, green eyed mom, right? I'll try to make an educated guess. Since blue is recessive, both of your SO's parents passed on their blue eye trait (so whatever was expressed, they both had at least one recessive blue trait). Since your eyes are green, it's a little complicated. I'm going to assume you don't have any brown eyed genes passed to you. Green eyes are weird, so I think you could, but I'm simplifying. I'll assume you have l one blue eyed parent and one green eyed parent (just since I have to start somewhere). [X] b. g. b. bb. gb. b. bb. gb. Guess would be 50% chance of blue, 50% chance of green. You could also have two green eyed parents (pretty rare) and or have been passed two green eyed traits [X] g. g. b. gb. gb. b. gb. gb. In which case you would more than likely have a green eyed baby (or rather, your baby would inherit both green and blue traits 100% of the time). But there's a weird spectrum and color mixing in eyes I don't quite get. I never really had to get into it since my dad and both his parents have blue eyes, and my mom and both her parents have brown eyes. Lol.

Reply  Close g  genevieve127 I think they have discovered now that eye color has a lot more genetics than originally thought. It has something to do with the amount of melanin that you are born with.

Well our daughter came out with blue eyes (to everyone's surprise!) & around 15 months they switched to green. They're amazing.

I know my husband has no melanin in his eye (I think that's what he said). When he has eye appointments the eye docs are always fascinated to see his eyes because usually people have a little. His is completely empty. He has the light blue eyes. And here I have dark, brown eyes, which I think means I have a lot of melanin in my eyes?

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  293 Posts K  KingsMommie Yes it's possible for your daughter  to have blue eyes.  She could have a recessive gene.  I'm blk (dark brown eyes) hubby is white (blue/green eyes) and our son was born with dark grey eyes that have gone to blue to blueish/grey to more of a grey now. He's 1.5 yrs old. I never thought I'd have a baby with eyes any color than brown L  Leyla28 @brexie  Same here except that my husband is Pakistani. Well, our two kids are proper Pakistani (no blue eyes :-()... I also wonder how this LO will be like. But it seems that the Pakistani genes are way stronger than mine :-) H  Hubbinator Blue eyes are recessive, that means it takes two recessive genes for them to occur. One recessive gene from you, one from your husband. If your daughter gets a recessive blue eyed gene from you and a dominate brown eyed gene from her dad, she will have brown eyes. k  kmezanava2135782723 @mcgeelisha  my daughter has blue eyes and brown hair. I'm white (blonde/green eyes) and husband is Mexican and Puerto Rican S  SarahChron @brexie  Both parents need to have blue eyes in the family. Both my parents had brown eyes. I ended up with blue because both grandmothers and one grandpa had blue eyes. Blue is represented with bb and Brown is represented with BB. So if both couple carry a b the it's likely for a baby to get bb. However if one parent does not carry a b and only BB the likely your baby can only be BB = brown or Bb =brown which in the case dominant gene rules. My husband is Asian I am Caucasian. Our children will never have blue eyes because he only has BB. However they may have lighter brown not so black. And of course they may be Bb so when they have children and marry someone with b then can have blue eyed grand babies hehehe H  Hubbinator @kmezanava2135782723  So somewhere along the line your husband inherited a recessive blue eyed gene. Really, not uncommon. My husband is from Brazil and our son ended up with blue eyes because there is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of Italian in him that gave him a recessive blue eyed gene. G  Gmom0218 @mcgeelisha  I am Vietnamese and DH is caucasian with red hair and hazel eyes. I must have some French in me b/c our son has the same coloring as daddy. He was born with blue eyes that turned hazel but his hair has stayed red. It can happen! 1  10bacon4 @mcgeelisha  My husband is Mexican and Portuguese with very dark brown eyes and I'm caucasian with blue eyes. At a year old our son's eyes are exactly the same blue as mine. We are definitely surprised since both my parents and his parents have brown eyes. n  nolechick429 @brexie  I'm Filipina and husband is Caucasian. Our 6 month old daughter has bright blue eyes. It skipped 5 generations on my side but it showed up eventually:) l  llotsoflove I'm white with hazel eyes and BF is black. He does not know of anyone on his side with blue but my Mothers family all have blue eyes. Our second son has beautiful blue grey eyes at 3 months old :) k  katedgd its nothing to do with indianess--do either of his parents or grandparents have light eyes? babes need 1 gene from eah side ti= e  etoledo3 I'm Cuban and my husband is puerto rican, we both have brown eyes. Our oldest son who's 9 has blue eyes. My grandparents had blue eyes on my dads side and my husband had to have blue eyes on his side of the family. Funny thing is that each of my siblings has one child with blue eyes. a  ana_karen so im full Mexican brown hair brown eyes. my hubby is half Mexican (dad) and half caucasian (mom) he has medium light brown eyes and hair. now one of my grampas gas hazel greenish eyes, my hubbys brother has hazel eyes as well. is there a chance my daughter can have colored eyes? 7  78renegade @brexie  Over the last couple of years scientists have discovered that there are MULTIPLE genes responsible for eye color so the old idea of using the punnet square (scientific equation involving mixing alleles, or more commonly known a dominant and recessive trait) apply to only each INDIVIDUAL gene. What this means is that it is possible for the blue eyes to come through. The information posted on here is somewhat true but a little outdated! Don't believe me --- google it! a  ayla_bean There is a possibility that your LO could have a combination of you and your mans eyes. My mother has really green eyes almost a blue and my biological father had dark brown, I can out with hazel eyes. Me and my bf are due in march and he is Indian and I am white, but because he has a bit of German in his family our baby could even come out with blue eyes. M  MonikaSk @brexie  This depends on the father, if your father passed on a "recessive light eye color" to you, your mother would have passed on one too. I would assume your dad is not 100% since he has recessive blue eyes jeans not a trait in that culture and it can from somewhere. It maybe way down line. (It's genealogy) now if your child's father has no recessive eye color jeans the dark will dominate the light. Such as it would be a constant dominate/recessive pairing & the dark will dominate. My parents have brown eyes, but both my grandmothers had blue. My sister has green eyes, I have brown, my husband has hazel & so does our daughter. So I am carrying a recessive jean. M  Mommysteinpfad It is possible if your baby's dad has a parent with blue eyes. If you out eye color into their alleles brown eyes=BB (both parents have brown eyes) or Bb(one parent has brown eyes and one parents has blue, which is what your child's alleles will be if she has brown eyes) and blue eyes=bb. So depending on your so alleles your daughters will be either Bb=she will have brown eyes or bb= your daughter will have blue eyes. If your so alleles are BB (both of his parents have brown eyes) your daughter will only get Bb alleles meaning she can only have brown eyes. C  Cevanne @brexie  Your dark eyes parent carried a recessive gene and a dominance one. Blue eyes must have 2 recessives. So your dad Bb. You bb. Your husband does not likely carry any recessive genes unless there has been an infusion somewhere in his families history. So he's probably BB. That means that your kids will probably be Bb. Sorry!!! So hazel or brown. My husbands family is Asian and both my kids ended up with his beautiful brown eyes. t  tambo_rambo83 Eye color is not simply determined by dominant recessive genetics! There are multiple alleles involved on 15 genes. It's much more complex than what people think ;) Related Articles & Discussions Baby Olympians Take Home Awards At Pittsburgh Hospital  Best Napper.

(Click to expand) Image by Mike DeHaan  Although the main question expectant parents ask is, ‘Will my baby be healthy?’ it’s also fun to ask other questions – such as, ‘What eye color will my baby have?’  Baby Eye Color Predictor  How can we predict a baby’s eye color?  We expect that a Caucasian baby will have gray or blue eyes at birth, since the color pigments have not yet developed fully, and usually African and Asian babies have brown eyes from birth.  By nine months, most Caucasian babies settle into their adult color: blue, brown, green or hazel. Some children will change eye color all the way up to age three, so don’t get too comfortable with your baby’s eye color until he or she is in preschool, it could still change!  Regardless of the eye color your baby ends up with later on, but before he or she is born, there’s no way to know for sure. Can you The question, however, is to predict your child’s eye color before birth, based on the parent’s genetic legacy? Let’s start with the classic “blue versus brown” match-up, and deal with the simplest situation.  ________________  Would you like to see more articles like this?

Each gene consists of a pair of alleles . Each parent donates one allele, so the child inherits a pair of alleles. The chart in the image above is a essentially a Punnett square.  A person with two dominant brown alleles, ‘ BB ‘, will have brown eyes. Another, with two recessive blue alleles, ‘ bb ‘, will have blue eyes. The brown dominance means that a mixed gene, ‘ Bb ‘, will be expressed as brown-eyed. Two blue-eyed people will have a blue-eyed child. Since the parents must each have a ‘bb’ gene, they can only pass ‘b’ alleles to the next generation. However, brown-eyed parents have either a ‘Bb’ or a ‘BB’ gene. You only know that a brown-eyed person has a mixed ‘Bb’ allele if that person had one blue-eyed parent.  From the chart, we can see that a child with brown-eyed parents has one chance in eight, or 12.5%, of being blue-eyed; and then only if one parent has some possible blue-eyed ancestry. Again, a mix of blue-eyed and brown-eyed parents has a “2/8=1/4=25%” chance of a blue-eyed child.  However, there is no guarantee that the situation will be quite this simple. Hazel and green eye color can both result from a weaker “brown” contribution.  Blue Eyed, Brown Eyed, Hazel or Green?  When you’re pregnant, it’s natural to wonder what your new baby’s eyes will be like, not to mention whether you’re having a boy or a girl , or how tall will she be . Although there’s no way to know for sure, you can use math to calculate the chances of brown eyes vs. blue, and more. © Copyright 2013 Mike DeHaan: Math, All rights Reserved.

Reply        .-'*'-.  says:    May 27, 2013 at 1:52 am     This is impossible. There is no way your recessive genes would have overpowered your dominant genes in such a frequent manner.    Reply        jackie  says:    May 28, 2014 at 7:54 pm     Youre an idiot. Recessive genes dont run out. Each child has equal opportunity to have a recessive eye color. And it just happened to work out the way it did. Just against odds, and entirely possible. Try taking biology again.    Reply        dcbandana  says:    October 21, 2014 at 8:02 pm     You are so wrong on this. I have three cousins that are sisters. The oldest is a red head with green eyes, the middle is a brunette with blue eyes and the youngest is a blonde with blue eyes.  They father is a brown eyes brunette and they mother is a blue eyes blonde.

My cousin has very dark brown eyes and her husband has dark brown eyes as well but his mother has blue eyes. They have two sons now one with blue eyes and one with dark brown eyes!

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful.

Though the color green often is associated with envy (even a character in Shakespeare's Othello refers to jealousy as "the green-ey'd monster"), many people consider green to be the most attractive eye color.  AllAboutVision.com recently conducted a survey of our visitors, asking them which eye color they considered most attractive. Here are the preferences, from more than 66,000 responses:                         Green eyes range in color from emerald to lime, and they produce an appearance that is both alluring and mysterious. [Enlarge]      Green: 20.3%  Light blue: 16.9%  Hazel: 16.0%  Dark blue: 15.2%  Gray: 10.9%  Honey: 7.9%  Amethyst: 6.9%  Brown: 5.9%   Part of the appeal of green eyes may be their rarity. Reliable statistics of the distribution of eye colors are difficult to find, but some sources put the worldwide prevalence of green eyes at only 2 percent.  On the other hand, a recent multi-year survey of students at a large Midwestern university in the United States found the prevalence of green eyes to be 15.2 percent.  Also, the prevalence of green eyes varies significantly by geographical region and country, with the greatest concentration in Northern and Central Europe. For example, in Edinburgh, Scotland, it's estimated that 29 percent of residents have green eyes (57 percent have blue eyes and only 14 percent have brown eyes ). In Iceland, a survey of the population revealed 89 percent of women and 87 percent of men have blue or green eye color.  What Produces Green Eyes?  Genetics play a role in determining eye color. But it's nearly impossible to predict with 100 percent certainty the eye color of a child simply by knowing the color of his or her parents' eyes.  This is because many different genes are involved in the inheritance of eye color, and different interactions and levels of expression of these genes can alter eye color outcomes.

The structure within the eye that is responsible for eye color is called the iris  the thin, circular structure that surrounds the pupil. In addition to controlling the size of the pupil and therefore the amount of light that enters the eye, the iris contains pigmented cells that determine eye color.     But here's where it gets interesting. Though there are many different eye colors, there are surprisingly few types of eye pigments. In fact, nearly all eye colors are determined by how much brown-colored pigment called melanin is contained in cells in the iris.  So how does a brown-colored pigment create green eyes  or blue eyes, or hazel eyes , or any eye color other than brown?  Differences in eye color are the result of different amounts of melanin pigment granules within cells in the iris called melanocytes. These cells acquire their genetically determined amount of melanin in early childhood, and their melanin content usually remains relatively constant throughout life.  A person with less melanin in the melanocytes of his or her iris will have a lighter eye color (blue or green, for example) than a person with a greater concentration of melanin, who will likely have brown eyes.  SEE ALSO:  What Determines Hazel Eye Color >  But an additional factor is involved in determining eye color, especially different shades of green eyes and blue eyes. When light strikes the iris and the pigment-containing melanocytes within the iris, this light is scattered and reflected. This phenomenon, called Rayleigh scattering, can produce different reflective colors, depending on the physical structure of the iris and the amount of melanocytes and density of melanin within the melanocytes.  Depending on these variables, Rayleigh scattering (which is the same phenomenon that makes a cloudless sky appear blue) can produce different shades of blue, green, hazel, and so on.  It's also noteworthy that, depending on the structure of the iris and the distribution of melanocytes within it, some eye colors can be difficult to categorize. For example, some "green" eyes may have a crown of hazel or brown near the pupil, making them appear hazel at times and green at other times, depending on lighting, makeup and the color of clothing a person wears.  Actress Emma Stone has green eyes. [Enlarge] (Photo: s_bukley / Shutterstock.com )  Celebrities With Green Eyes  Does the allure of green eyes help entertainers and other famous people get noticed? Maybe.  Here's a short list of actors, singers and other celebrities who might owe a small part of their appeal to their green eyes:  Adele, Adrien Brody, Daniel Day-Lewis, Katie Holmes, Terrence Howard, Kate Hudson, Scarlett Johansson, John Krasinski, Leona Lewis, Lindsay Lohan, Kate Middleton (Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge), Clive Owen, Joaquin Phoenix, Eddie Redmayne, Rihanna, Smokey Robinson, Paul Rudd,  Kristen Stewart, Emma Stone, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Charlize Theron, Bruce Willis.  Eyes Are Like Snowflakes  If you really wish you had green eyes instead of the eye color you were born with, one option is to wear color contact lenses . Several brands and shades of green contact lenses are available, including lenses without corrective power if you are lucky enough to have naturally perfect eyesight .  If you have naturally green eyes and you wear eyeglasses, lenses with anti-reflective (AR) coating will help showcase your green eye color. AR coating eliminates distracting reflections in your eyeglasses, allowing others to see the beauty and expressiveness of your green eyes.  Whatever color your eyes may be, they are truly unique and can never be replicated. Like snowflakes, the features of each and every eye are different and, therefore, magnificent  no matter what color your eyes are.

I was born with green eyes , a trait that I took from my mother. At first, I never understood the constant compliments I received for my eye color. I’ve heard a lot of sayings from friends, family members, and even strangers: “Trae, you have really pretty eyes” or “You could kill someone with eyes like that.”  People would even ask me to take off my glasses just to get a glimpse of what color my eyes were. I knew that my eye color was pretty unusual compared to my peers. Before I researched the origins of green eyes, I asked myself—are green eyes really attractive as people make it? Why are green eyes so rare?  One of the most common eye colors in the population is brown eyes . About 55% of people in the world have brown eyes. Brown eyes have dominant traits, and they are usually darker in color. The second common eye color is blue . However, green eyes are considered the rarest eye color. So, what makes green eyes rare? First of all, green eyes, in contrast to the common eye color, lack melanin (dark pigmentation that occurs in specific parts of the human body). Approximately 2% of people in the world have green eyes, and that’s a very small percentage.  Green eye color. Created by Catsastrific.  The most interesting thing about green eyes is that they are not naturally shown until a baby is at least 6 months old. Babies who eventually have green eyes are typically born with lighter eye colors, like gray or blue.  Because of these factors, green eyes prove to be an attractive trait. In fact, based on a study from All About Vision, a survey was created to determine which eye color is considered the most appealing to the person. The results demonstrated that 20.3% of the responses chose ‘green’ as their preference, while ‘light blue’ and ‘hazel’ eye colors have 3.4% less responses. The survey concluded that the majority appeal is due to the unusualness of the eye color.  The conclusion: Green eyes are considered attractive because it’s a rare color. Common eye colors like brown, blue, even black, are typically seen all around because of its pigmentation. Green eyes, however, are rarely seen and that’s what makes them appealing.  I’m pretty satisfied with my eye color. Not just because of the compliments, but my eye color makes me different. Perhaps that’s why people adore Channing Tatum so much?  Channing Tatum’s green eyes.

I have a feeling that this is something you can’t really boil down and address. The whole idea of the word “attractive” is that it applies to someone’s opinion and develops their interest more.  Green eyes are rare yes, but they could be present in anyone and be many different shades of green. How attractive someone with green eyes is depends on so many outside variables and opinions. I’m thinking that maybe this is too affected by chance and possibilities to be tackled logically.

Just look around you and take a good look at peoples eye colour. There is a high chance you will notice a lot of people with brown eyes. Brown eyes are by far most common in humans. In some countries, the brown eye colour is the only colour there is.  In other countries however, you would find a lot of diversity. Green, blue, hazel, grey and even violet eyes do exist as well.           Green eyes in the Middle East     Brown is the most common eye colour  In the US only 1 out of 6 people have a light (blue) eye colour. The brown eye colour is in the US the most prevalent. No surprise, because brown is also the dominant colour. In other countries, especially in northern Europe, brown is less common. Estonia for example is a very light eyed country with almost 98% having the blue eyes.   Africa is very brown   The further you go to the south, the more chance there is that you will find a person with brown eyes. In southern europe for instance, there is on average a change of 80% you will find a brown eyed person. Lighter eyes are also in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece) less common. Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared.   Light eyes in Scandinavia   Scandinavians tend to have a very light appearence. Light eyes are definitely the standard in these northern countries. Sweden, Norway and Denmark all have high percentages of light eyed people. Also Finland and Iceland are extremely light with almost 90% of them having light eyes (green, grey and blue). Other ''northern'' countries like The Netherlands, Scotland and Germany have light eyed peoples too. In The Netherlands approximately 80% of the inhabitants have green or blue eyes. Germany (especially the northern part of the country) follows with almost 70% having lighter eye colours.   Green eyes are rare   Within the ''light'' eyed population, the green eyes are outnumbered by the blue eyes. Green eyes are dominant over the blue eye colour but there are only very few people that carry the genes responsible for green eyes. Only 1-2% of the entire human population have green eyes.   Shades of green eyes   Green eyes can look very different. They can be very dark, almost brown. Sometimes they are very light: almost neon. It all depends on the amount and type of melanin inside the iris. If you have a lot of melanin, your eyes look darker and if you have only a tiny bit, your eyes tend to look very light (bright).  The light green eyes are most common in Iceland, The Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland, Estonia and Scandinavia. Dark green eyes can be find all over Europe, the US and even in Pakistan.       Dark green eyes      Light green eyes                                            Green eyes and red hair  Scientist suspects there is a relation between red hair and the green eye colour. It looks like there is a high correlation between those two human traits. Having the red hair colour is also very unique (and recessive). Only 1 - 2 % of the entire human population have naturally red hair. Of course, not only red hair coexist with green eyes. Also blondes and darker hair colours tend to have green eyes (or the other way around).    Green eyes and gender  Normally, you would expect a 50/50 gender variation between the eye colours (blue, brown), but scientist found a positive correlation between being a woman and having the green eye colour. Why green eyes are more found in women is still unknown and it is not certain a gender differentiation actually exist. The findings could be biased somehow.      red hair, green eyes and being male: the odds are very low     Hazel eyes are Green eyes?  Some people confuse hazel eyes with green eyes. Hazel eyes are also very rare but are different than green eyes. First of all, hazel eyes have more melanin. They look more brownish and are overall a bit darker, sometimes with a golden teint. People with hazel eyes often notice a considerable change in their eye colour, especially when a lot of light reflect on their eyes. Secondly, some green eyes have a lot of yellow pigment in them. Hazel eyes share this yellow pigmentation hence the confusion.       Eyes with a Green-Hazel colour    Where do green eyes come from?  Green eyes can be found anywhere but you will find them most of the time in Europe. Some people believe green eyes came to existence due to a mixture of blue and brown eyes. This idea became popular because a lot of green eyes can be found in areas where brown and blue eyes came together. When we look at the map, the highest percentage of green eyes can be found in Scotland. Ireland also has (relative) a lot of green eyed inhabitants.   Green eyes have lipochrome. This lipochrome (also known as feomelanin ) is a yellowish pigment. People with green eyes and especially those with amber coloured eyes have a lot of this yellow lipochrome inside their irises. Those with blue, brown or grey eyes usually don't have any lipochrome. When you have a lot of lipochrome inside your iris, you might have the amber eye colour. When you only have a small portion of this yellow pigment, your eyes might look a bit more green/blue-ish.  The combination of the yellow pigment and low amount of melanin gives rise to light green eyes. When you have a moderate amount of melanin but also lipochrome, your eyes probably look darker green. When you only have a low amount of melanin (and no lipochrome), your eyes look blue.   Light Green Eyes: (very) low amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blueish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + low amount of lipochrome   Yellowish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + (very) high amount of lipochrome   Dark Green Eyes : moderate amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Brownish Green Eyes : high amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blue Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Brown Eyes : (very) high amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Amber Eyes : (very) low melanin + very high amount of lipochrome  Grey Eyes : low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)     Heterochromia Iridum  Some people have a truly unique thing going on with their eyes: they have more than one colour! When one eye has a different colour than the other; it is called heterochromia iridum. When only a small portion of the iris has a different colour, it is called: partial heterochromia.      complete heterochromia: blue and green  Read for more information (Dutch): Green Eyes: a rare trait in humans     Geplaatst door    Jonrik A     op  10:46             Email This BlogThis!

I am glad you mentioned of an additional pigment, lipochrome, in green and amber eyes.  Most articles just assume that green eyes are caused by an intermediate amount melanin.  What exactly is lipochrome?  Does it have other names? One additional point you may want to clarify:  From what I've read elsewhere, for blue versus brown eyes, it's not just the amount of melanin but rather the location.  Both blue and brown eyes have melanin in the back of the iris, but only brown eyes have melanin in the stroma, the front layer of the iris.  That the location of melanin, and not just the amount, affects eye color makes intuitive sense, as there are people with dark blue eyes (high amount in back of iris, none in the stroma), and others with light brown eyes (moderate amounts in both back of iris and in stroma). Thank you for your article.  What source did you read that discussed the lipochrome - I can find very few articles mentioning it.

My brother is blonde with blue eyes and mine is brown with blue eyes. I was wondering if there is a layer of pigmentation under the first layer (the one everyone can see)? If you look up close to my eyes, I noticed that it appeared as if there was a second layer of pigmentation. I have my pupil and then green with black streaks. Then, I have my blue pigmentation with whitish streaks. To be honest, I don't know if my eyes are blue or grey. They only change to grey some times if I wear blue clothing. Also, the green layer is a dull green and when my pupil shrinks, the blue closes in, but the green doesn't appear to move. The green really looks like another layer. It's like oil and water trying to mix. They are right next to one another, but they aren't mixing and seem separate. Or a better example, when you poor gelatin onto colored paper. They don't mix, it just appears like the colored paper is a layer behind the gelatin. I've seen this is some pictures of eyes, but I don't know why it's like that. The blue seems to just, "disperse" you could say. Like, poring powdered lemonade into water, the powder sort of strings out (bad example).  My friend has partial heterochromia. She was born with blue eyes and they didn't turn to hazel until she was around 5. There is a dark brown splotch in one eye that makes her whole eye look dark brown from a distance. Why is it that her eye color didn't change for such a long period of time and produced the splotch? Delete Rebecca Cardenas 16 January 2016 at 10:46 My husband has awesome eyes like yours sound, except his have dark green, light green, yellow and Amber splotches that actually look red, then both his eyes have a different arrangement of these colors. One of his eyes has a lot more amber in it. Also what he wears seems to make them appear as different colors, lighting does and he emotions change the color too! When he is tired I swear his eyes turn dark green, when he is very angry they seen to sparkle with vibrant colors. I just have light brown eyes, two of our sons gave Brown eyes too, one has dark and the other light, only our middle sin has hazel Brown eyes, they look different with what he wears, lighting or his moods too. Your families eye colors seem very pretty especially yours. I am jealous, want to trade? I have always wanted gray, violet or very light green/bluish eyes. Beautiful colors!! Ps. Make sure you color coordinate some blouses, dresses, shoes, scarves, purses and make-up for those eyes of yours. Show the beauties off for those of us stuck with poo-poo eyes.

Most articles about the little girl say they are green. some say blue.

If I could post a picture, I would. My son's dad's eyes are dark, dark brown. My son came out with Chestnut eyes- greenish outside and a reddish brown inside. Eye color is way more complicated than "mom has brown, dad has blue." We all carry 2 sets of genes and mutations happen along the way. It's definitely possible for 2 blue eyed parents to have a brown eyed child and vise versa. The genetic color possibility charts are online. You also have to remember that we aren't clones of our parents. Variations happen.

Anony I I Delete Carmencita 29 October 2015 at 05:22 Hi Olessya, my eyes are similar although yours are amber-golden  and ice green while mine have a lighter yellow ring around the pupil and the rest of the iris is  dark blue-grey (making them appear green). So they are not true green actually but heterochromatic (not hazel either as there is no actual brown, just yellow and blue-grey). What is most unusual about your eyes is the shape of the amber ring, it's really thick and looks like a sunflower! So pretty! My eyes were blue-grey until I was twelve and my mom's were the same color until she was in her forties (my brother still has bue-grey eyes, while my dad and sister both have sky-blue eyes). We both came down with the same autoimmune thyroid disorder and grew yellow rings which changed our eye color. Even though I have been in remission since I was fourteen my eyes never changed back. It's interesting how health can affect eye color. Delete Unknown 20 November 2015 at 02:45 That's really pretty. I've been trying to find an eye colour similar to mine on the web and I can't see anything when it comes up with green eyes. I've got goldfish brown around the pupil and a greyish blue green basic and then a really dark navy outline it's strange.... Delete Unknown 5 March 2016 at 04:37 My eyes are very similar, except that they have an outer medium bluish ring.  They go from amber near the pupil to the overall color of green, and then have that bluish ring around the iris.  I have been told they are very beautiful.  One of my daughters has the same color eyes as me.  The oldest has blue/gray eyes, and the youngest has a dark version of mine and my middle daughters eyes.  Genes do funny things.  My fathers eyes were a beautiful sky blue and my mothers were amber.

Reply Delete Marie Lavender 2 June 2015 at 19:40 Hi. I have dark green eyes with a dark blue outline. Everyone always calls them 'cat eyes'. LOL. I have definite Irish heritage. The funny thing is that everyone in my immediate and extended family has blue eyes, but I am the only one with green. And none of them can think of anyone deceased who had that color. Weird, huh?

Delete Reply JustARandom Troll 6 June 2015 at 21:58 All my life i thought hazel was a light greenish color but i guess i was wrong. My eyes change from light green to golden green depending on the amount of light. My dad also has green eyes but they are a really dark green and my mom has very light blue eyes so i guess that explains the yellow green that i have.. I just created a pof profile today and didn't know what to write down for my eye color and tried to figure what hazel is because it is written on my drivers license. I do have a bit brown in them but you have to look very closely to spot it so that is what kinda throws me off in trying to figure out if they are hazel or green. I could say they are 10 percent brown 30 percent yellow and 60 percent green. Reply Delete Anonymous 8 June 2015 at 01:26 Hi, interesting article, though as a green-eyed, dark-haired AFRICAN lady I disagree with the the following statement.  "Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared". In South Africa and Namibia especially, light coloured eyes are not that rare at all, in both countries there are so may different races/ethnic groups in Namibia there are at least 11 major groups.  In the Baster community in Rehoboth you'll find a lot of light-eyed people with light hair, red hair is is not that rare as well. Their ancestors were mainly of Dutch and German origin, my great-grandfather was Irish. In my family from my father's side, close and extended most have blue, green eyes.

Reply Delete Anonymous 23 August 2015 at 05:10 My eyes changed from dark brown to hazel after I bumped my head. I believe this is the work of hidden genes. My grandfather has hazel eyes and my mother has brown eyes and my father has blue eyes so there would have been a 50% chance of having brown eyes; which I had then I would if anything have the hazel eyes genes because I got one of my mother's X chromosomes instead of my fathers since I am male.

Reply Delete Anonymous 26 November 2015 at 01:01 I think I have sea green eyes mixed with grey because my eyes flip through green, blue, grey, and teal/turquoise kind of changes. People say I have hazel eyes because of the gold ring around the pupil. I also have one fleck of heterochromia in one eye and it's not noticeable unless your face is too close for my comfort. I was even told once that my eyes had become mahogany red colour for a minute in a certain light but I couldn't try it and its yet too happen again. So I dount know what eyes I have but on legal paper I have to put hazel. Reply Delete Anonymous 26 November 2015 at 16:12 I'm full Asian with brown eyes as a kid, but over the years they have lightened. I would say that they are hazel as they change color in the light. In my twenties, I noticed a green spot in one eyes, and now, in my forties, I have a gold-green ring that surrounds a light brown ring around the iris. So Asians can have light eyes!

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

It has been estimated that only 2% of the world’s population have true green eyes. To give you an idea of just how special green eyes are, consider this factoid. Currently, it is estimated that around 7 billion people live on the planet. Going by the math, this means only 140 million people have some shade of green as an eye color. There are only a handful of celebrities who have green eyes and even a smaller number who are male. If you are one of these people – consider yourself lucky.    FYI: green eyes can express in several shades, including hazel, emerald, jade and blue-green. In super rare cases, they can even appear amber. When you take into account the different variations of this color, including some people with hues of brown, the number of people who can be classified as having green eyes jumps from 2% to 8%. MOST ATTRACTIVE EYE COLOR Guy Counseling recently asked nearly 90,000 website visitors which eye color they considered most attractive (as of 7/4/17). Here are the responses, broken down for each by percentages.

Other information about various shades of green eye color will be touched upon, including popular hues. Are you ready? Let’s jump right in! What is the science of Green Eyes? Male Green Eyes WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF GREEN EYES? Many people want to know where green eyes come from. Ultimately, eye color is a function of genetics and is determined by two factors: (1) the pigmentation of the iris and (2) the way light scatters around the iris itself. Let’s take a quick look at both. Pigmentation of a person’s iris can run the gamut from the darkest color, black to lightest, blue. Largely influencing pigmentation is something called melanin , a complex polymer made from the amino acid tyrosine. The appearance of green and shades of green (i.e. jade, hazel eyes and emerald) are the result of a  phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering; which is a 25 cent term used to describe the way light scatters after riding its spectrum wavelength. Most people mistakenly believe that colors like green and blue are in the iris – but they’re not. Your eye color is a function of how light diffuses across the melanin base, which again is genetically determined. Credit: Wiki Commons GREEN EYES: ORIGINS AND GENES Old theory Prior to 2008, scientists thought eye color was determined by one dominant gene. It was postulated that an eye color hierarchy existed with brown being at the top of the ladder and blue resting at the bottom. Under the old way of thinking, this meant if your dad had brown eyes and your mom had blue eyes, you would likely be born with brown colored eyes. A parental combination of two green eyes would translate into you having green eyes. Recessive genes were also thought to partially influence eye color. New theory New research, presented in a 2008 publication of the American Journal of Human Genetics washed the old way of thinking about eyes and color. The new research suggests that as many as 16 genes may influence the way color is expressed in the iris. The unscientific translation means that a baby can be born with just about any eye color, regardless of what their parents have. It is important to note, however, that hereditary variables need to be factored into the equation. The video below offers an excellent scientific analysis of how people get different color eyes, including green, blue, brown, hazel and some rare variations. GENETIC PREVALENCE OF GREEN EYES Interestingly enough, there are anthropological records of early humans with green eyes living around the mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area contained a natural land bridge between Europe and Asia. Knowns as the “Silk Route” or “Silk Roads”; this ancient passageway was used by early civilizations for the lucrative trade silk, sometimes between 120 BCE – 1450s CE (Yao, et all, 2000). The silk route is thought to be a major reason for the distribution of green eyes WHERE DO GREEN EYES COME FROM? We know from history that Silk Road played an important role in the creation of the civilizations of China, the Goguryeo kingdom in Korea, much of Japan, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Persia and the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Because it served as a significant trade route for many early traders, it is thought that mating between various groups may have been part of gene distribution. This may help to explain why green eyes can be found in various groups across Europe, Africa and Asia. GENETIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND EYE COLOR Genetic anthropology is growing branch of science that examines DNA testing with concrete archaeological, historical and language-based evidence to uncover the history of ancient migration patterns in early human civilizations. Thanks to this emerging area of research, scientists are learning more and more about the etiology of eye color. This is why today, you can have your DNA tested to determine your genetic background. In turn, this may help to explain the genetic reasons for your ocular hue. GREEN EYES AND GEOLOGIC TIME Much of Europe, Asia and Africa and large swaths of the middle east have been native lands to people with green eyes for centuries. When studying the geologic time scale; a tool used to measure our planets history, it is thought that green eyes may have appeared in people of Iranian, Spanish, Brazilian and Pakistani decent sometime during the late part of the Cenozoic period . Specifically, this would be between the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs some 2 to 3 million years ago.  Any race, including people who are Caucasian, Asian, African, Native Indian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and pre-Colombians (Indigenous Peoples of the Americas) can have green colored eyes. Anthropologists believe eye color, like hazel, blue, brown and green, are the direct result of migratory behaviors. Because of inter-mixing of groups, coupled with thousands of genetic mutations, we see various shades of green throughout modern man. Jessee Metcalfe has green eyes.

Many people are curious if eye color can change. The answer is – absolutely! People with green, blue or brown eyes all experience change in color from time to time. Causes for eye color changes include: The way light scatters Mood Health/Medical reasons HOW EYE COLOR CAN CHANGE DUE TO HEALTH The color of your iris can permanently change if you have glaucoma and take certain medications for treatment. If you have light colored eyes and want to keep them, you need to be extremely careful with the glaucoma medications you take. Make sure you consult with your eye doctor to discover all of the facts. Other reasons eye color can change to certain types of diseases. Examples include Horner’s syndrome and Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis. Should you notice any changes in the color of your eyes, contact your doctor immediately. Green eyes of Tom Welling: Credit insoonia.com GREEN EYES AND HEALTH RISKS If you have green eyes, you are more susceptible to the sun’s harmful radiation. This has to do with our old friend melanin previously mentioned. Simply put, green eyed people can develop certain types of ocular cancers, like intraocular melanoma . People with light colored eyes should wear UV protective sunglasses when outdoors. Jensen Ackles has light green eyes: Credit Fanpop PHENOMENON OF RAYLEIGH SCATTERING As mentioned previously, green eyes, blue eyes and brown eyes do not actually have these colors deposited into the iris. In truth, your eye pigmentation has a little brown in them. Because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, your eyes will reflect back a certain colored hue. Green eyes can come in different shades Green eyes with gold specs of Eddie Redmaybe HOW LIGHT CHANGES EYE COLOR Using the prior mentioned scientific principle of Rayleigh scattering, transformation of light particles that land on the iris will impact its coloristic appearance. This can result in a person having hazel, amber, jade, emerald, blue and even gray! Other factors can influence the shade of green in eyes. Lighting: Artificial lighting (aka: light bulbs) can impact how eye color is experienced. The intensity of the light hitting your iris will either amplify or soften your iris’s appearance.  Time of day: Light from the sun may be more intense earlier in the day or later, which means your iris will “pick-up” different intensities from the solar spectrum .  Reflective colors: The color of everything around you, including the cloths you have on, can intensify how eye color is experienced. Certain colors, like gold, blue and other greens can amplify the flecks reflecting outward from your Iris.  Makeup: Some people wear eye-makeup, like gold and purple eye-shadow, to accentuate the natural green of the iris. This can cause the desired effect of having chameleon eyes.  Gorgeous makeup makes a line of eye shadow specifically designed for people with green eye color. Allergies: Some people with allergies have “scratchy eyes” which can cause the surrounding “whites” of the eyes to become red (aka: bloodshot eyes). This can have the effect of amplifying your eye color and creating baggy eyes.Most people do not desire this look.  Emotional state: While your emotional state does not directly change the color of your eyes, what you are feeling at any given point in time can impact how they are perceived. Specifically, if you are depressed and crying, your pupil may dilate, which may give off a darker appearance.  Substances: Use of alcohol, uppers, downers and other kinds of medications can cause your pupils to become larger or smaller. The end result can mean your eye color becomes more intense. Josh Henderson has a green eye and blue eye because of heterochromia. HETEROCHROMIA Some people have a condition called heterochromia that causes one eye to be one color (like green) and the other eye to be a different color (like blue). While multiple causes have been suggested, the current scientific thinking suggests that a lack of genetic diversity is the main reason for heterochromia. It is thought that the condition is caused by a mutation of the genes determining melanin distribution, which often becomes changed due to chromosomal homogeneity. The photograph above of actor Josh Henderson is an example of someone with heterochromia. Notice one of his eyes are green. The other is blue. Very rare and unique. NOTE OF CAUTION If your eye color changes suddenly or if you notice your pupils remain dilated for no apparent reason for an extended period of time, contact your physician immediately. Your eyes are not something you want to play with. What Do Your Eyes Say About You Video Channing Tatum has a unique pair of green eyes that are almost jade.

Your self-esteem should not be tied to your eye color – keep this in mind when you take the poll. Use this link to access the quick survey . Your response is completely confidential. DID GREEN EYES COME FROM ALIENS? The color of your eyes is unique. No two people have exactly the same eye color, unless they are identical twins. When we examine the origins of eye color, we can see their evolution changed over the course of time. It has been postulated that adaptations in eye color occurred as a result of a changing environment. Some people believe green eyes and blue eyes are the result of an alien species depositing their DNA into the human genome.  But if you look at other species on our planet, you will see eye colors come in rainbow, including oranges, reds and yellows. Did these differing ocular colors come from aliens as well? FINAL THOUGHTS ON GREEN EYES We are still learning a great deal about eye color with new research happening every day.

John Michael  says:   December 14, 2015 at 12:00 am  Thats interesting because I have blond hair and green eyes being the only one in my family. I am a male and have retained these colours all my life. Would these same Iranians be from the area where the ancient civilisation of Media once stood?

But I wasn’t.  Really!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 4, 2015 at 8:30 pm  Same here, i feel like in the wrong place   belaboa9  says:   November 4, 2015 at 11:53 pm  Are you the only one with green eyes too?  At least I can fall back on the fact that I’m 3/4 Irish!  All the boys in my family have blue eyes, and all the girls have brown or hazel.  I feel like an oddball!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 4:43 pm  Yes, among my large family (grandma, uncles, cousins, etc) I am the only one with green eyes. Well, my bio dad has green eyes, but my mum is a single mother, so I barely know him. But it’s not just about the eye colour, it’s something more, like behaviour, it’s strange o:   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 7:52 pm  Are you the black sheep of the family?  I am.  I’m considered the “weird” one because I’m the smartest, most creative, adventurous, risk-taking and mystical one.  I follow my own path no matter what anyone else says.  And I have snakes! LOL  And two rescue dogs.   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 10:14 pm  Kinda, well, i do not consider myself that smart, but i tell you that my family doesn’t even get jokes from the simpsons 😐   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 11:07 pm  Bummer.  So how is your behaviour different from the rest of your family’s?   Alejandro Ontiveroz  says:   February 10, 2016 at 8:02 pm  I have green eyes too and so does my sister. I guess it is because my dad has vary light blue eyes and my mom has semi dark brown eyes. I only know 3 people with green eyes. But i don’t think im very attractive. Im a male and i have girl like features. And i have long hair.   belaboa9  says:   February 11, 2016 at 6:36 pm  Yeah, but how old are you?  Most guys aren’t their handsomest until they’re 35-40 years old!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:56 pm  yep that would be me too. But have no dogs, love snakes, never had them as pets though.   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:53 pm  EVERYONE has blue eyes! No other colors at all just Blue! Even Aunts an Cousins sea of blue eyes!   belaboa9  says:   June 24, 2016 at 8:39 pm  Like I said to someone else, it must be a really recessive gene that decided to resurface, unless we are adopted, or our daddies aren’t really our daddies!  OMG!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:54 pm  I know just how you feel. 🙂   marley  says:   July 29, 2017 at 2:56 pm  I have pure green light eyes that for some reason sparkle   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 1:48 am  I also am the only green eye person in my family. Both parents, and all siblings have blue eyes. Also, all blood relations on both sides have blue eyes. Not one brown eye, and I’m the one green eye. It’s always bothered me!   belaboa9  says:   June 22, 2016 at 2:12 pm  Me, too!  I’ve always wondered how many generations back in my family I would have to go, to find another green-eyed person.  It’s got to come from the Irish side, or maybe there’s a little bit of gypsy on the Italian side!  In any case, I’ll never know!   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:52 pm  In Nursing School I was told eye color only comes from parents. I’ve wondered about my paternity every since. I am the odd ball! Not just eye color either. To chicken to ask. Lol My mother said IT WAS THE EVIL COMING OUT IN ME when I mentioned it once! Don’t know if that was joke, but I never mentioned it again   belaboa9  says:   June 23, 2016 at 1:22 am  LOL!  I learned the same thing in Nursing School!  That’s why I always thought I was adopted.  But I wasn’t.  I’ve got my birth certificate, and all my baby pictures are in the family albums!  It must be a really recessive gene which has resurfaced! ????  Lucky for us!   Shannon Mullis-Long  says:   October 6, 2015 at 9:31 am  Myself and three cousins have green eyes. My mother has brown my father blue. Mine are constantly changing from blue green to emerald green to grey. No two days are the same and sometimes changing twice or three times a day.   Luke  says:   October 24, 2015 at 6:08 am  I have green eyes and have been told more than once that my eyes look good.   Fred E Rick  says:   October 31, 2015 at 10:14 pm  I have green eyes. I can see through your soul.   Rinny  says:   January 14, 2017 at 3:44 pm  Me too. I have that piercing through your soul quality. 🙂   Kimberly Parrish  says:   December 3, 2015 at 6:36 pm  Jense Ackles I could stare into those green eyes all day they are so beautiful.   Anna  says:   December 5, 2015 at 1:31 am  I have green eyes, but the guy that you have as “Latino” is actually half black and his name is Damon…   John D. Moore  says:   December 5, 2015 at 1:40 am  You are right! Thanks for letting me know???? I’ll correct   Dinara  says:   December 11, 2015 at 7:35 pm  Interesting article. I have green eyes. Actually one green, the other one is slightly brown. Not so noticeable fortunately ????   Glen  says:   December 12, 2015 at 9:20 pm  I had blue eyes as a child, which was odd at the time as both my mother and father has brown, (I also had blonde hair as a child but now it is dark brown) I’m 35 now and my eye’s are now a deep shade of green and have been since a young age, I am the youngest of 4 and the only other person in my immediate family with green eyes is my eldest brother. I wasn’t aware green eyes were considered rare.   Tucker  says:   March 21, 2017 at 6:00 pm  I had blue eyes as a young child but they turned to green before my teens.   John Michael  says:   December 13, 2015 at 11:55 pm  I am a male and have blond hair and 1 green lighter eye and 1 green darker eye. I wonder what the percentages for this is? I am also the only one in my family with it and I thought I was adopted. So I did check with the hospital and I’m legit. Lol. Use to feel a bit freakish because there a so few of us. Now I know I’m blessed!   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:47 am  I have very light yellow green eyes with blue around the rim. How does that factor into the green eyed equation? I know that it does come from the Italian side og my family, with only one member of each genation having this particular eye coloe.   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:50 am  Oh, and I not only have a very unusual eye color (only one in my family) but am lefy-handed as well (again the only one in my family). I probably would have been burned at the stake in Salem as a witch. Ha!   Pavel Sivi  says:   February 23, 2016 at 9:42 am  all my famly has different kinds of green eyes. but mine are strange they sometimes seem to be blue and sometimes green. depends on the light. but as far as i see they are green   Karen Denning  says:   April 6, 2016 at 4:49 pm  What is it about green eyes that catches people’s attention? It makes me feel uneasy when I notice someone staring at my eyes. From my perspective I seem to be hyper sensitive to light compared to most people. I squint a lot which gives others the impression that I’m mad or something. LOL   Eric Weeber  says:   June 18, 2016 at 4:51 pm  i know the feeling with that one..mine are light to mid green and i have always squinted alot due to light.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:37 pm  I think in my life about 2 people have commented on my eye colour!  But agree about the light although mine are darker than a lot of blue-eyed folk, I think.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f684a4b7e1174fe4f3923947702156e9b71123bc1fb2577d471e9b9b7a1d0a3.jpg   Rebecca A  says:   December 18, 2016 at 11:29 am  I very light sensitive eyes. It feels natural to wear sunglasses constantly.  I have prescription medications to try to help ease the pain and discomfort   Lillian Carbone  says:   February 12, 2017 at 12:40 pm  I have green eyes and brown hair but my eyes also have a yellow hue to them and I have a small brown speck in one of my eyes ,I’ve been told that I have Lizzie’s eyes lol   kira  says:   April 16, 2017 at 1:51 pm  thats called hazel   marley  says:   July 29, 2017 at 3:00 pm  OMG the same thing myne is right above green (but insted of brown its yellow ) same as my mom   Anne Lunar  says:   April 14, 2016 at 6:50 pm  This definitely makes us non-green eyed people feel not so special haha   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:53 pm  What makes green eyes “beautiful” is their rareness not their colour! Every eye has it’s own and special shade that makes them beautiful in its way! Yours sure are too! 😀   Nicole Lovelace  says:   September 1, 2016 at 9:25 pm  That’s not true, green is a beautiful color. Even if they weren’t rare, they would still be a popular eye color.   Carla  says:   September 6, 2016 at 6:42 pm  Indeed, but I’m not talking about preference but about rareness. Think about it… If 90% of the population had green eyes and only 10% had, for example, brown eyes, which color would be more desired… green or brown? I honestly think that it’s more a matter of exclusiveness than color. And please don’t think that I’m saying this beacause I don’t love my eye color or something. I actually do have green eyes, I just don’t like when people compare themselves with others, just because they don’t have what those people do have and don’t feel special because of it. If that even makes sense… :S xD (Sorry if I’m a little off with my writing skills, not my mother tongue xD, And sorry too for that unnecessary large reply xD)   Michele Kasel  says:   April 29, 2016 at 11:13 pm  i have green eyes and if i wear violet-blue contact lenses they look cool!   i also have brown contacts–i guess i get sorta bored with the same color eyes for 50 years LOL   Gabbyy Fratt  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:33 pm  I have green eyes but if u look close they have a little bit of light brown in the middle then blue all around the rest but farther away they r bright green it’s rlly weird   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:50 pm  This only means that you have some shade of hazel eyes. Half brown, half green, and sometimes some blue too!   hunter  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:36 pm  i have green eyes and my parent have them to and my brother and sister and all my other family members have them to   Ann  says:   July 26, 2016 at 6:26 pm  Same with me, except I don’t know about extended family.   Tyler Karl Lia  says:   May 18, 2016 at 3:03 am  Would have like the article, but the mixed race bastards who have my eyes ruined it.   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:09 pm  I got my green eyrs from my father, and they ate popular on that dide of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:11 pm  I got my green eyes from my father and they are popular on that side of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:58 pm  Very rare eye color always new that, but was surprised how rare!  Pretty sure in the case of eyes it only Parents not like Hair color or skin! Not sure why!   Deborah Wilbourn  says:   May 24, 2016 at 12:07 am  I’m the middle child of 5 children both father and mother have brown eyes older brother blue eyes older sister younger sister and younger brother all have brown eyes. As far back as I can trace  in family history mostly blue eyes and brown eyes going back to my great grandparents none with green eyes can be found.  I do have one daughter with green eyes the other with blue, their dad has blue eyes. This article I read has a lot of information that is true for me and the trait of having green eyes, however I do believe there is much more information missing due to my age and experience.   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:35 pm  There goes my Mendel Pundit square argument Big B little b times Big B little b gets 2 Brown eyes BB 50!per cent blue eyes Little b little b All that is down the tubes   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:37 pm  My father brown eyes My mother blue 2 dark eyed sister 2 blue eyed( I’m considered blue but I’m green)   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm  As long as you have a brown eyed parent they whole all eye color genes. A brown eye parent can have any eye color child from how I understood it in school   Denis St  says:   June 14, 2016 at 5:23 pm  What should I say… My eyes turned from light blue to grassy/olive green in 8-9th grade, one of my eye corner has a little part of light blue, but hardly noticeable (unless you pay close attention) my hair from ginger turned to the darkest brown/black then it turned into almost dirty blonde color..   Beth  says:   June 16, 2016 at 2:33 am  Eye color doesn’t run the “gambit,” people. It runs the “gamut.” A gamut is a scale; a gambit is a chess move, or other scheme.   John Hollywood  says:   August 5, 2016 at 2:55 pm  Congratz – you win an Internet prize!

The hottest guy I ever met had this brown eyes that make me felt like a whole hidden universe was beneath them.. that he wouldn’t show. So use your brownies and do the same with cute guys! But be nice. Don’t underestimate the power. Don’t be mean as this guy ALMOST did <3   GC  says:   August 15, 2016 at 7:26 pm  I am 100% Mexican and have green eyes that can look bright blue when I wear blue or in all white environments.  I was told I was born with sky blue eyes but they changed color when I was 8-9 month old to green.  All the members of my bio father have green eyes and his father as well.  All my mother’s have brown except for her great grandmma who had blue.  Im older now and notice my eye color is changing to more blue than green, I don’t like that!  And never knew they were rare??  I went to grammar school in small town in central Mexico.  Out of a class of about 25, 6 kids had green eyes, WTH??  And I never knew why I was sensitiv to bright light and I hate the sun!!  I was freaked to learn in the poll, I am Latino, a Scorpio and other traits I can relate to LoL!  Thx   BTDTGTTS  says:   August 16, 2016 at 3:29 pm  My husband has one blue and one green eye.  I have pale grey blue eyes.  My son has brilliant blue eyes with a dark ring around them and a few yellow specks.  My daughter has soft green eyes with a dark ring and yellow specks.  I love all their eye colors and just wish mine weren’t so wishy washy grey blue.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:38 pm  grey-blue is a great eye colour!   David  says:   August 17, 2016 at 9:18 am  I have green eyes which are very sensitive to light or even a breeze (especially a winter one). I used to get compliments about my eyes when I was younger but not so much now. 🙁 I like the fact that they are a rare trait.   Gulfidan  says:   September 8, 2016 at 5:25 pm  Well I do have very different green eye color most people they don’t believe it is my regular color???? I am Turkish and no one in my family have my eye color! When I cry it turns to bright green when I go out sunny day turns to yellow when I am angry dark green???? Well thank you dr John Moore for great article!   John D. Moore  says:   September 8, 2016 at 6:12 pm  Thanks and great pic!   OlivierDMG  says:   September 10, 2016 at 6:31 pm  yup people notice my eyes and start to tell me how beautiful they are, sometimes it’s just weird.   ahls  says:   September 11, 2016 at 3:26 pm  I used to have brown eyes, here is my video what i did to change it to hazel green  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOe00BkUbjE   Tonia Gleaton  says:   September 27, 2016 at 1:16 pm  NO Green eyes on my mothers side of the family they are all BLUE or BROWN on my Dad’s side BLUE,BROWN a,small % of GREEN eyes,  I am one of those with the GREEN eyes and always been very proud of them for sure. I have a sister with HAZEL eyes but her eyes have more BROWN then GREEN in them but they are still beautiful, my brother her TWIN has CRYSTAL BLUE eyes. I am working on our genealogy and had a gathering this summer of cousins and family that I had never met but it AMAZED me that 90% and that maybe LOW!!! They were GREEN eyed it was varies shades but they were GREEN eyed . I have never seen that many GREEN eyed people in one place it was AWESOME   Americkan  says:   October 23, 2016 at 3:36 pm  I have very green eyes and very fair skin,when I was born and until about four my hair was white,then went to blond,then light brown. At the ripe age of 35 my hair went from light brown right back to white/silver. My eye color however remained green. My parents and 4siblings do not have green eyes, only me. Until recently I never gave my eye color much thought but now I think I’m just a little unique.   Di  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:03 pm  I have green eyes and thought it was a common color, maybe not.   Hamza Asghar Khan  says:   November 5, 2016 at 3:39 am  My Eyes are extremely dark.. I sometimes wonder if they are even green or not… 😛 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2e2d37bb1417410beeebff175db2f1902155e33dcbd96f167797f8c349dd0df5.jpg   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:33 pm  yup, definitely green!   Wanza Good  says:   November 30, 2016 at 1:49 am  Looks kind of like a mixture of mostly grey with some green.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:31 pm  I have green eyes and always wanted dark brown!!   Rebecca A  says:   December 18, 2016 at 11:27 am  I have green eyes. My mother said when I was born my eyes were so blue they looked purple and stayed that way for 3 years. Now people don’t believe I’m not wearing contacts. It’s creepy for me. I can’t even look people in the face directly   Bedra Ogdee  says:   June 21, 2017 at 5:40 pm  My eyes are also green. My mother said that when I was born they were so blue that they looked purple and my hair was jet black. I am of Lebanese and Hispanic descent. I am the only one in the family including my fathers side and my mothers side. None of my cousins on either side. I do get many compliments and sometimes I get very embarrassed. I am proud to know that green eyes are rare.   Meryl Burke  says:   January 4, 2017 at 4:47 am  Dr. John Moore, Fun article but I’ve got to let you know for some reason hue was spelled incorrectly as hew. Thanks, Truly, green eyes.   John D. Moore  says:   January 4, 2017 at 9:02 am  Thanks, I’ll correct!   Rinny  says:   January 14, 2017 at 4:02 pm  I do not believe green eyes are rare. I know many many people with green eyes.

EbonyIvoryRose  says:   January 25, 2017 at 9:11 pm  I’m the only one in my whole family that has green eyes, as far as i know. It’s pretty funny actually, I’m completely the odd one out as the only green eyed person amongst all brown eyes.   Shadowpaw  says:   February 12, 2017 at 3:30 pm  I  have light greenish yellow eyes, chartreuse colored.  I have night blindness to some degree and my eyes are slightly light sensitive My hair is blondish red naturally. When i get mad some people have told me that my eyes flash, which i have never seen but i have been told this by numerous people.  Some people don’t like me to stare at them because they say it’s spooky.  Lol ! .   BeltedFool  says:   February 23, 2017 at 5:12 am  Is my eyes green? I wonder if they are hazel!??!?!

My optician said that they are more sensitive to light. I have to were sunglasses or I get bad headaches in bright sunshine. I seem to be able to see in the dark better than anyone I know. I have red hair too. I am the only one in my whole family with green eyes. The others are blue or brown.   ART emis  says:   March 21, 2017 at 12:50 pm  I have green eyes ,too! People often tell me that I have extremeley beautiful eyes…..I know people who have green eyes but are “pale” and I dont really like them.I think my eyes would be better if they were a darker shade of green ,but I haven’t any problem………..I think they look nice this is an old photo of me (a years ago)  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f84bce406aab07c4f0c6c856dd2c568adb49d854407e8a11e8a6075641855592.png   Sonya Marlene Tanner  says:   April 11, 2017 at 6:15 pm  Green or hazel? Sometimes they change color. I have a small amount of amber around my iris. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cc002c227ea46608f17fab5f2fd2f232944bb735e5b4e0065d82bb965e7067cf.png   Holly DeAnna Moore  says:   April 12, 2017 at 1:31 am  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/01d9f95c88d59da81daf67f758c43d98ff565d8a748c710c92d2425239d2b987.jpg Born with deep blue eyes but they changed to green when I was around 8 years old.   Kimberly Shand  says:   April 18, 2017 at 8:07 pm  Well, now I know why people always freak out when they realize I have green: They think I possess powers, or was influenced by an alien. Seriously? Why don’t they just burn me at the stake?   Michael  says:   April 28, 2017 at 7:39 am  i actually can’t even tell tbh seem green in someways but also brown, i’ve had people tell me green, hazel, brown i have no idea top picture is with flash bottom without flash it’s hard to make sure my pupils aren’t dilated seem to need lot’s of light or my eyes be mostly the black dot  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b3d27e393812440bf1e9d0ec766aa0f745133a90f1e6851818a480886ffea6ab.jpg  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bd66c80b062e84b9c0324ba7e176e33593bb1f39765e8d31e7f75b67f0566e29.jpg   Fred Krueger  says:   May 1, 2017 at 12:18 am  I have green eyes. I didn’t understand how special it was until I read this article.  Now I feel like the chosen one. Maybe I belong on another planet ?   For the Love of Purple  says:   May 3, 2017 at 3:09 am  Interesting I am A- and I have deep green eyes that change colours between ‘gold’ ‘blue’ or ‘Hazel’  depending on the colour of clothing I wear or the eye makeup I apply.  I have been told that my eyes are both intense and unnerving on many occasions throughout my life.  What is interesting to myself, is that I can meet someone look, into their eyes and instantly within a millisecond know whether they are a friend or foe…   Brandy Grote  says:   June 5, 2017 at 6:03 pm  Glad to know it isn’t DNA based!  Dad has lovely mahogany eyes, Mom has pale jade green eyes.  (Both brothers have the same brown as Dad.) Mine were deep blue as a young child, going turquoise, then changing from blue to green based on my strong emotions as a young adult.  Now they are nearly always green, with some blue tint that gets more or less each day. Hair is light amber brown.   Holly Rodriguez  says:   July 17, 2017 at 7:19 am  I am hispanic, my great grandparents were basque people of spain. I am only one in my family with green eyes, everyone else is dark brown eyes.  http://i.imgur.com/anMY47p.jpg   Howard Fleming  says:   July 23, 2017 at 7:27 pm  I have green eyes the only one in my family some how I’ve always been or felt different.   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:30 pm  Can Italian people have green eyes   John  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:35 pm  It’s very common for Italian people to have green or hazel eyes. Italy is heavily influenced by the entire Mediterranean with many people who have lighter color eyes.   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:39 pm  so Italian people most likely have light eyes because I am full Italian like my mom and dad are both itailan   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:37 pm  I am the only one with green eyes in my family but my grandpa on my moms side has like blue and green eyes. But my two brothers have hazels eyes that sometimes turn like dark blue with brown around the blue. Comments are closed.

Animated video shows the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

Bookmark Discussion cassychavarria wrote: Ok so my husband and i both have brown eyes, but in my family my dad has hazel his mother (my grandmother) has green eyes, her father (my great grandfather) had Bright blue eyes, My oldest brother has green eyes, my second oldest brother has blue eyes, my youngest brother has hazel eyes, and my cousin which is my dads sisters daughter has gray eyes . My husband just has brown eyes that runs in his side of the family . What are the chances of my baby having colored eyes ? Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  7 Posts h  hjawwad15 Probably very small chances of anything other than brown. I have blue eyes and my husband has brown. I am pretty sure our baby will just have brown eyes. Brown is pretty dominant and with your husband having only brown eyed parents, I don't think its likely recessive genes like colored eyes will show up over that. But there's a chance you could be surprised! I'm sure your baby will be adorable no matter what :) Reply  Close M  Miramarsol My brother sent me a video of different percentages. Here are the screenshots I took. My dad has beautiful green/blue eyes.his grandpa had blue eyes. My husbands great grandpa had green eyes, but my husband and I have brown eyes so we think the percentage is low Reply  Close M  Miramarsol Reply  Close M  Miramarsol Reply  Close M  Miramarsol Reply  Close c  ceis15 Your husband would also have to have light eyes somewhere in his family, which could be in there without knowing.  light eyes are recessive, so your baby would have to get the recessive gene from both you and your husband that's why the chances are so low.  It could happen though.  Everyone in my family has blue or green but mine are hazel.  My husband and his mother have dark brown, but he doesn't know his family beyond that and he is always saying how Dominican people are a combination of Native, West African, and Spanish, so you never know what you're going to get.  Well our son is almost a year old and his eyes are still blue!!

Thanks everyone :) just for fun Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  34 Posts a  ataylor036 @mamataylor14  I'm not good at the hair. But do either of your grandparents have blue eyes? If not you child should have brown eyes. If either one of your grandparents passed a recessive trait for blue eyes down to your parents your baby could have a 50/50 chance between brown or blue eyes. m  mamataylor14 @ataylor036  My paternal grandfather has blue eyes and my maternal grandmother has blue eyes and both of his grandparents have blue c  crazylove_bells This is so fun...I could make a guess, but it would probably have no scientific significance lol!  My husband is 1/2 Filipino- dark features and brown eyes... and I'm a blondie with green eyes...our baby came out blond at first lol!  She now has very light brown hair and kept her BLUE eyes! Beautiful with almond shaped eyes :) Ok my guess for your baby...dirty blonde hair with blue eyes! You'll have to keep us updated once baby arrives :) m  mamataylor14 @crazylove_bells  That's awesome! I bet she's beautiful! A friend of mine is African American and her baby came out with bright icy blue eyes! Crazy :) and so pretty! j  jlyons02 Punnett square.. you have to line up you and your DH, but you need to know what traits are dominant and what's recessive.. I know green eyes are recessive so I have 2 recessive genes, and my SO has brown eyes, which is dominant, so our baby will most likely have brown eyes, unless my SO has 1 dominant brown trait and one recessive green, in which case there is 1/4 chance of green eyes. z  zmomma2 I have no idea. But I'm a red head and everyone told me there was no way id get my red headed baby because the gene is so recessive. Well, my girl has a head full of bright red curly hair!! She also has daddy's big brown eyes, which is a rare combination :) She's a pretty even split between all of our features, so I'm curious about number 2! b  blessedmomma12 @mamataylor14  I'm brown/brown and DH is brown/hazel. Our DD has beautiful dark auburn/red hair and blue eyes! Dark eyelashes unlike many lighter red heads. Never would've guessed we'd get a red head bc no parents/grandparents. A couple random great aunts/uncles apparently had red. We love our sweet surprise! G  GiraffeGirl Bb/BB = Brown eyes always bb= Blue Eyes always a person with bb can only produce gametes with "b" a person with BB can only produce gametes with "B" a person with Bb produces gametes with "B" OR "b"  your DH can only produce "b", so your child definitely has at least one "b" i believe that you having hazel eyes is the same genetically as having blue eyes, therefore you only produce "b" as well, which means that your parents are each Bb. so....you are having a blue eyed little one :) k  kwitt318 I think... blue eyes are recessive gene. However with that many you may end up with a blue eyed babe! I believe curly is recessive too, so unless you had curly its unlikely babe will have curly!  I would aim to guess brown hair, but its just a guess! G  GiraffeGirl @GiraffeGirl  to correct myself a bit...genetics refer to "light" and "dark" eyes.  If your eyes are light, you are having a blue eyed baby.  I know people who call their eyes "hazel" but they are really brown. j  jennigiddi @mamataylor14  I don't know the whole dominant recessive thing but I can tell you what I have. I have brown hair now, blonde as a child and hazel eyes. My mom had hazel my dad blue. My husband is 1/2 Japanese so he has dark hair brown eyes. His dad had blue. Our 3 oldest all ended up with blonde hair blue eyes. I do expect their hair to darken through the years. My youngest ended up with the brown eyes and dark hair. Kind of curious to see what this one ends up having. I would've liked 1 to get my eyes. :) c  candicel125 My husband is blue, I'm brown. All 3 of our boys are blue :) m  mamataylor14 These are what I call hazel haha they seem light to me so maybe these with my DG blue eyes we will have a blue eyes girl! :) H  Haleigh4512 Ok mines crazy difficult. Lol My family : grandpa and grandma( maternal ) have blue eyes. Grandma and grandpa (paternal) brown. My mom has green and my dad has brown. I have blue. Hubbys: i have no idea on grandparents (his paternal are 100%Germanic if that helps), his mom has brown his dad has blue and my hubby has brown. So i have no guesses. Lol m  mamataylor14 @jennigiddi  That's so fun! I guess you just never know until they come :)) G  GiraffeGirl @mamataylor14  what beautiful eye balls you have!!!  :)) i would say they are brown from a genetic standpoint....so, you have at least one "B".  you could have a "b" and therefore a blue eyed LO, otherwise, s/he will be "Bb" and beautifuly brown eyed.  :) s  svtbaby Is this applicable to just color of eyes/hair or even kind of hair like curly, wavy or straight? Or shape of the eyes like tiny or big? G  GiraffeGirl @Haleigh4512  you bring a "bb" to the scene and your hubby brings "Bb"...so you have a 50% chance of brown, 50% chance of blue. n  nymommyof3 I have hazel green eyes and brown curly hair.

Reply  Close b  bwolfe31 50% chance blue 50% green. Well, not actually. Eye color is more complicated because it's a multiple allele trait. Green eyes are special so there's even a slight change babe could have brown eyes due to the alleles carried by the green eyed parent. It's a much smaller chance though. Reply  Close b  beccakayee16 Omg I've been wondering this forever! I have red hair, pale skin and blue/green eyes. Both my parents have the exact same.

All 4 of us came out with blue but the odds are 50/50 between blue and green :)... I have blue and my husband has green so we'll see! Reply  Close c  christen7000 I have the same here it's 50/50 chance. There is a genealogy site that can give you more odds using grandparent (your parents) info. I forgot the site. You can also predict type of chin, ears, and hair line. -- my odds remain at 50/50 only because his mom has hazel eyes. My green eyes come from great grandparents. If his mom had brown eyes the odd would lean more blue as it dominates lineage. Reply  Close f  fortressmom2012 Three of our four have blue. We'll see what number 5 ends up having:) Reply  Close B  BabyGarblet For example: X B. b g Bg bg b Bb bb Eyes are weird because they have color mixing, but if I remember eight grade science kiiind of right, he above is my Pinot square. I have brown eyes, my mom has brown eyes, my dad has blue eyes (I am represented by the top row). Husband has greenish eyes (just called them green), his mom has greenish eyes. His dad has blue eyes. He is represented on the left hand side. Brown is dominant, blue is recessive, and I actually think green is recessive as well, but I'm pretty sure it's also a mix of blue and something else. Eyes are weird. So! My results read: Brown (dominant over green) Blue green (I'd consider that green) Brown (dominant over blue) Blue blue (just blue!) I think we have a 50% chance of a brown eyes baby, a 25% chance of a blue eyed baby, and a 25% chance of a green eyed (or more complicated color) baby. Moms who did genetics or anything similar in college and can remember how eye color works, can you check my work? It's been waaaaaaaay too long. Lol Reply  Close s  sarahholl9986 Yeah I'm adopted so I know nothing about my parents eye colors just his! Reply  Close m  mom_wife_4life My husband has brown eyes (like dark dark brown) and I have blue eyes. Our first daughter has blue eyes like me and our 2nd daughter has green eyes like my husbands mom. I for sure thought both my girls would get brown eyes bc I'm the only blue eyed in my family other than my dad (everyone else has brown eyes) and then of course my husband has dark brown eyes so I was for sure our kids would get dark eyes. But nope, they got light eyes. So I'm expecting this one to have light eyes as well since our other 2 got the light eye genes. But honestly, anything can happen since there are blue, brown, and green eyes in the family. So basically what I'm saying, is you just never know. Lol Reply  Close B  BabyGarblet Blue eyed dad, green eyed mom, right? I'll try to make an educated guess. Since blue is recessive, both of your SO's parents passed on their blue eye trait (so whatever was expressed, they both had at least one recessive blue trait). Since your eyes are green, it's a little complicated. I'm going to assume you don't have any brown eyed genes passed to you. Green eyes are weird, so I think you could, but I'm simplifying. I'll assume you have l one blue eyed parent and one green eyed parent (just since I have to start somewhere). [X] b. g. b. bb. gb. b. bb. gb. Guess would be 50% chance of blue, 50% chance of green. You could also have two green eyed parents (pretty rare) and or have been passed two green eyed traits [X] g. g. b. gb. gb. b. gb. gb. In which case you would more than likely have a green eyed baby (or rather, your baby would inherit both green and blue traits 100% of the time). But there's a weird spectrum and color mixing in eyes I don't quite get. I never really had to get into it since my dad and both his parents have blue eyes, and my mom and both her parents have brown eyes. Lol.

Reply  Close s  sadabug I have brown eyes and I'm mostly Croatian. We just had our 3rd child this past December and he was my first brown eyed baby. My son has beautiful blue eyes. My daughter has a rare eye condition where she doesn't really have any irises. However, there is a slight rim and it appears to be blue as well. My husband has beautiful green eyes. I'm hoping this boy will have his daddy's eyes. Then I'll have one of each color and a black eyed child (due to the Aniridia). Reply  Close g  genevieve127 I think they have discovered now that eye color has a lot more genetics than originally thought. It has something to do with the amount of melanin that you are born with. My husband I both have brown eyes and really dark hair. Our son came out blonde haired and blue eyed and he is 100% ours we didn't let him out of our sight at the hospital lol. It's a total gamble. I'm curios what this one is going to look like will we have 2 children that look nothing like us? Haha Reply  Close n  nshelton16 My husband & I both have very very dark brown eyes, he is Mexican also so his whole family has brown eyes. I'm half black, half white & all of my siblings have brown eyes. However my mom has hazel eyes & her father, my grandfather has blue eyes. Well our daughter came out with blue eyes (to everyone's surprise!) & around 15 months they switched to green. They're amazing. But a lot of people ask how it happened & we're still not sure other than maybe some recessive genes from my mothers side. So anything is possible!

My husbands family is all blue eyes and I'm pretty sure my family has brown eyes unfortunately I'm not 100% sure about my family since I was removed when I was a toddler.

I know my husband has no melanin in his eye (I think that's what he said). When he has eye appointments the eye docs are always fascinated to see his eyes because usually people have a little. His is completely empty. He has the light blue eyes. And here I have dark, brown eyes, which I think means I have a lot of melanin in my eyes? Makes sense for our daughter's eyes to be somewhere between since we are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. I am curious to see what babe #2 has! Reply  Close m  mollmill0 @Pumi7  Agreed!

Keep in mind that my dad has black hair and brownish eyes with tan skin. Any Indian and white couples?! Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  293 Posts K  KingsMommie Yes it's possible for your daughter  to have blue eyes.  She could have a recessive gene.  I'm blk (dark brown eyes) hubby is white (blue/green eyes) and our son was born with dark grey eyes that have gone to blue to blueish/grey to more of a grey now. He's 1.5 yrs old. I never thought I'd have a baby with eyes any color than brown L  Leyla28 @brexie  Same here except that my husband is Pakistani. Well, our two kids are proper Pakistani (no blue eyes :-()... I also wonder how this LO will be like. But it seems that the Pakistani genes are way stronger than mine :-) H  Hubbinator Blue eyes are recessive, that means it takes two recessive genes for them to occur. One recessive gene from you, one from your husband. If your daughter gets a recessive blue eyed gene from you and a dominate brown eyed gene from her dad, she will have brown eyes. k  kmezanava2135782723 @mcgeelisha  my daughter has blue eyes and brown hair. I'm white (blonde/green eyes) and husband is Mexican and Puerto Rican S  SarahChron @brexie  Both parents need to have blue eyes in the family. Both my parents had brown eyes. I ended up with blue because both grandmothers and one grandpa had blue eyes. Blue is represented with bb and Brown is represented with BB. So if both couple carry a b the it's likely for a baby to get bb. However if one parent does not carry a b and only BB the likely your baby can only be BB = brown or Bb =brown which in the case dominant gene rules. My husband is Asian I am Caucasian. Our children will never have blue eyes because he only has BB. However they may have lighter brown not so black. And of course they may be Bb so when they have children and marry someone with b then can have blue eyed grand babies hehehe H  Hubbinator @kmezanava2135782723  So somewhere along the line your husband inherited a recessive blue eyed gene. Really, not uncommon. My husband is from Brazil and our son ended up with blue eyes because there is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of Italian in him that gave him a recessive blue eyed gene. G  Gmom0218 @mcgeelisha  I am Vietnamese and DH is caucasian with red hair and hazel eyes. I must have some French in me b/c our son has the same coloring as daddy. He was born with blue eyes that turned hazel but his hair has stayed red. It can happen! 1  10bacon4 @mcgeelisha  My husband is Mexican and Portuguese with very dark brown eyes and I'm caucasian with blue eyes. At a year old our son's eyes are exactly the same blue as mine. We are definitely surprised since both my parents and his parents have brown eyes. n  nolechick429 @brexie  I'm Filipina and husband is Caucasian. Our 6 month old daughter has bright blue eyes. It skipped 5 generations on my side but it showed up eventually:) l  llotsoflove I'm white with hazel eyes and BF is black. He does not know of anyone on his side with blue but my Mothers family all have blue eyes. Our second son has beautiful blue grey eyes at 3 months old :) k  katedgd its nothing to do with indianess--do either of his parents or grandparents have light eyes? babes need 1 gene from eah side ti= e  etoledo3 I'm Cuban and my husband is puerto rican, we both have brown eyes. Our oldest son who's 9 has blue eyes. My grandparents had blue eyes on my dads side and my husband had to have blue eyes on his side of the family. Funny thing is that each of my siblings has one child with blue eyes. a  ana_karen so im full Mexican brown hair brown eyes. my hubby is half Mexican (dad) and half caucasian (mom) he has medium light brown eyes and hair. now one of my grampas gas hazel greenish eyes, my hubbys brother has hazel eyes as well. is there a chance my daughter can have colored eyes? 7  78renegade @brexie  Over the last couple of years scientists have discovered that there are MULTIPLE genes responsible for eye color so the old idea of using the punnet square (scientific equation involving mixing alleles, or more commonly known a dominant and recessive trait) apply to only each INDIVIDUAL gene. What this means is that it is possible for the blue eyes to come through. The information posted on here is somewhat true but a little outdated! Don't believe me --- google it! a  ayla_bean There is a possibility that your LO could have a combination of you and your mans eyes. My mother has really green eyes almost a blue and my biological father had dark brown, I can out with hazel eyes. Me and my bf are due in march and he is Indian and I am white, but because he has a bit of German in his family our baby could even come out with blue eyes. M  MonikaSk @brexie  This depends on the father, if your father passed on a "recessive light eye color" to you, your mother would have passed on one too. I would assume your dad is not 100% since he has recessive blue eyes jeans not a trait in that culture and it can from somewhere. It maybe way down line. (It's genealogy) now if your child's father has no recessive eye color jeans the dark will dominate the light. Such as it would be a constant dominate/recessive pairing & the dark will dominate. My parents have brown eyes, but both my grandmothers had blue. My sister has green eyes, I have brown, my husband has hazel & so does our daughter. So I am carrying a recessive jean. M  Mommysteinpfad It is possible if your baby's dad has a parent with blue eyes. If you out eye color into their alleles brown eyes=BB (both parents have brown eyes) or Bb(one parent has brown eyes and one parents has blue, which is what your child's alleles will be if she has brown eyes) and blue eyes=bb. So depending on your so alleles your daughters will be either Bb=she will have brown eyes or bb= your daughter will have blue eyes. If your so alleles are BB (both of his parents have brown eyes) your daughter will only get Bb alleles meaning she can only have brown eyes. C  Cevanne @brexie  Your dark eyes parent carried a recessive gene and a dominance one. Blue eyes must have 2 recessives. So your dad Bb. You bb. Your husband does not likely carry any recessive genes unless there has been an infusion somewhere in his families history. So he's probably BB. That means that your kids will probably be Bb. Sorry!!! So hazel or brown. My husbands family is Asian and both my kids ended up with his beautiful brown eyes. t  tambo_rambo83 Eye color is not simply determined by dominant recessive genetics! There are multiple alleles involved on 15 genes. It's much more complex than what people think ;) Related Articles & Discussions Baby Olympians Take Home Awards At Pittsburgh Hospital  Best Napper.

(Click to expand) Image by Mike DeHaan  Although the main question expectant parents ask is, ‘Will my baby be healthy?’ it’s also fun to ask other questions – such as, ‘What eye color will my baby have?’  Baby Eye Color Predictor  How can we predict a baby’s eye color?  We expect that a Caucasian baby will have gray or blue eyes at birth, since the color pigments have not yet developed fully, and usually African and Asian babies have brown eyes from birth.  By nine months, most Caucasian babies settle into their adult color: blue, brown, green or hazel. Some children will change eye color all the way up to age three, so don’t get too comfortable with your baby’s eye color until he or she is in preschool, it could still change!  Regardless of the eye color your baby ends up with later on, but before he or she is born, there’s no way to know for sure. Can you The question, however, is to predict your child’s eye color before birth, based on the parent’s genetic legacy? Let’s start with the classic “blue versus brown” match-up, and deal with the simplest situation.  ________________  Would you like to see more articles like this?

Each gene consists of a pair of alleles . Each parent donates one allele, so the child inherits a pair of alleles. The chart in the image above is a essentially a Punnett square.  A person with two dominant brown alleles, ‘ BB ‘, will have brown eyes. Another, with two recessive blue alleles, ‘ bb ‘, will have blue eyes. The brown dominance means that a mixed gene, ‘ Bb ‘, will be expressed as brown-eyed. Two blue-eyed people will have a blue-eyed child. Since the parents must each have a ‘bb’ gene, they can only pass ‘b’ alleles to the next generation. However, brown-eyed parents have either a ‘Bb’ or a ‘BB’ gene. You only know that a brown-eyed person has a mixed ‘Bb’ allele if that person had one blue-eyed parent.  From the chart, we can see that a child with brown-eyed parents has one chance in eight, or 12.5%, of being blue-eyed; and then only if one parent has some possible blue-eyed ancestry. Again, a mix of blue-eyed and brown-eyed parents has a “2/8=1/4=25%” chance of a blue-eyed child.  However, there is no guarantee that the situation will be quite this simple. Hazel and green eye color can both result from a weaker “brown” contribution.  Blue Eyed, Brown Eyed, Hazel or Green?  When you’re pregnant, it’s natural to wonder what your new baby’s eyes will be like, not to mention whether you’re having a boy or a girl , or how tall will she be . Although there’s no way to know for sure, you can use math to calculate the chances of brown eyes vs. blue, and more. © Copyright 2013 Mike DeHaan: Math, All rights Reserved.

Reply        .-'*'-.  says:    May 27, 2013 at 1:52 am     This is impossible. There is no way your recessive genes would have overpowered your dominant genes in such a frequent manner.    Reply        jackie  says:    May 28, 2014 at 7:54 pm     Youre an idiot. Recessive genes dont run out. Each child has equal opportunity to have a recessive eye color. And it just happened to work out the way it did. Just against odds, and entirely possible. Try taking biology again.    Reply        dcbandana  says:    October 21, 2014 at 8:02 pm     You are so wrong on this. I have three cousins that are sisters. The oldest is a red head with green eyes, the middle is a brunette with blue eyes and the youngest is a blonde with blue eyes.  They father is a brown eyes brunette and they mother is a blue eyes blonde.

Reply        She  says:    June 21, 2015 at 11:20 pm     Actually it is possible! Lots of amazing things happen I guess! My cousin has very dark brown eyes and her husband has dark brown eyes as well but his mother has blue eyes. They have two sons now one with blue eyes and one with dark brown eyes!
