Share on Google Plus       Share on Facebook              Physical Custody  Physical custody means that a parent has the right to have a child live with him or her. Some states will award joint physical custody when the child spends significant amounts of time with both parents. Joint physical custody works best if parents live relatively close to each other, as it lessens the stress on children and allows them to maintain a somewhat normal routine.  Where the child lives primarily with one parent and has visitation with the other, generally the parent with whom the child primarily lives (called the "custodial" parent) will have sole or primary physical custody, and the other parent (the noncustodial parent) will have the right to visitation or parenting time with his or her child.  Legal Custody  Legal custody of a child means having the right and the obligation to make decisions about a child's upbringing. A parent with legal custody can make decisions about the child's schooling, religious upbringing and medical care, for example. In many states, courts regularly award joint legal custody, which means that the decision making is shared by both parents.  If you share joint legal custody with the other parent and you exclude him or her from the decision-making process, your ex can take you back to court and ask the judge to enforce the custody agreement. You won't get fined or go to jail, but it will probably be embarrassing and cause more friction between the two of you -- which may harm the children. What's more, if you're represented by an attorney, it's sure to be expensive.  If you believe the circumstances between you and your child's other parent make it impossible to share joint legal custody (the other parent won't communicate with you about important matters or is abusive), you can go to court and ask for sole legal custody. But, in many states, joint legal custody is preferred, so you will have to convince a family court judge that it is not in the best interests of your child.  To learn more about child custody and how it is determined in your state, see the Child Custody & Paternity section on DivorceNet.com (part of the Nolo network of legal websites).  Sole Custody  One parent can have either sole legal custody or sole physical custody of a child. Courts generally won't hesitate to award sole physical custody to one parent if the other parent is deemed unfit -- for example, because of alcohol or drug dependency or charges of child abuse or neglect.  However, in most states, courts are moving away from awarding sole custody to one parent and toward enlarging the role both parents play in their children's lives. Even where courts do award sole physical custody, the parties often still share joint legal custody, and the noncustodial parent enjoys a generous visitation schedule. In these situations, the parents would make joint decisions about the child's upbringing, but one parent would be deemed the primary physical caretaker, while the other parent would have visitation rights under a parenting agreement or schedule.  It goes without saying that there may be animosity between you and your soon-to-be ex-spouse. But it's best not to seek sole custody unless the other parent truly causes direct harm to the children. Even then, courts may still allow the other parent supervised visitation.  Joint Custody  Parents who don't live together have joint custody (also called shared custody) when they share the decision-making responsibilities for, and/or physical control and custody of, their children. Joint custody can exist if the parents are divorced, separated, or no longer cohabiting, or even if they never lived together. Joint custody may be:   joint legal custody  joint physical custody (where the children spend a significant portion of time with each parent), or  joint legal and physical custody.

Joint Custody Arrangements  When parents share joint custody, they usually work out a schedule according to their work requirements, housing arrangements and the children's needs. If the parents cannot agree on a schedule, the court will impose an arrangement. A common pattern is for children to split weeks between each parent's house or apartment. Other joint physical custody arrangements include:   alternating months, years, or six-month periods, or  spending weekends and holidays with one parent, while spending weekdays with the other.   There is even a joint custody arrangement where the children remain in the family home and the parents take turns moving in and out, spending their out time in separate housing of their own. This is commonly called "bird's nest custody" or "nesting."  Pros and Cons of Joint Custody  Joint custody has the advantages of assuring the children continuing contact and involvement with both parents. And it alleviates some of the burdens of parenting for each parent.  There are, of course, disadvantages:   Children must be shuttled around.  Parental noncooperation or ill will can have seriously negative effects on children.  Maintaining two homes for the children can be expensive.   If you have a joint custody arrangement, maintain detailed and organized financial records of your expenses. Keep receipts for groceries, school and after-school activities, clothing and medical care. At some point, your ex may claim he or she has spent more money on the kids than you have, and a judge will appreciate your detailed records.

A parent may be deemed unfit if they have been abusive, neglected, or failed to provide proper care for the child. A parent with a mental disturbance or addiction to drugs or alcohol may also be found to be an unfit parent. Failure to visit, provide support, or incarceration are other examples of grounds for being found unfit.  For example, one state declares the power of the juvenile court to terminate the rights of a natural parent (a) who was "unfit or incompetent by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child," (b) who "abandoned the child," or (c) who "substantially and continuously or repeatedly refused or failed to give the child proper parental care and protection."  Some state laws provide for a fitness hearing to be held after an adjudication of neglect, dependency or abuse. In such cases, the law may specify a time period after such an adjudication in which the parent may make efforts to resolve the problem, such as seeking drug or alcohol treatment. A parent's failure to make reasonable efforts and progress within the specifed time frame is a ground of unfitness. Local laws should be consulted for specific requirements in your area.  The court will often award sole custody to the other parent when one parent is deemed unfit, or if both parents are deemed unfit, the child may be placed in foster care. Evidence of parental unfitness toward one child may be grounds for terminating the parental rights to other children even though the parent never abused or neglected those children. The best interest of the child is the determining factor.  In determining the child's best interest, one court has stated that it shall consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:  (i) The willingness of the parent or parents to receive or care for
the child; (ii) That the child has been removed from the custody of the parent
by temporary order of the court for a period of six months and further
finds that: (A) The conditions which led to the removal still exist; (B) There is little likelihood that those conditions will be remedied
at an early date so that the child can be returned to the parent in the
near future; and (C) The continuation of the parent-child relationship greatly diminishes
the child's prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent

But getting custody of your child requires an understanding of the various factors considered by family courts. What follows are some of the most frequently asked questions we get regarding child custody, joint custody, child visitation, and family law.  When considering who should get custody of a child, what factors does a court look at?  In almost all situations, a court will keep one primary question in mind when deciding a custody case, namely, what is in the best interests of the child ? To answer this question, courts generally look at a number of different factors, such as:   A parent's financial and physical ability to provide a child with essentials like food, medical care, shelter and clothing A parent's medical history, both physical and mental The child's age, sex and medical history, both physical and mental A parent's vocation and habits, including things like excessive drinking or smoking The child's choice if the child is of a certain age, normally 12 years old The emotional bond between child and parent The wishes of both parents The willingness of each parent to support the child's relationship with the other parent The level of adjustment needed from the child if forced to move to a new school, city, or state, and The quality of life the child enjoys in the child's current status quo, and Whether any parent has brought false or malicious charges of child abuse on the other parent.  If, upon looking at all of these factors, a court cannot decide what is in the best interests of the child, courts normally tend to look closely at which parent would most likely provide the child with a stable household. This can vary depending on the child's age. If the child is young, custody may go to the primary caregiver. However, if the child is older, custody may be awarded to the parent that is better situated to provide the child with access to education, friends, and social development.  Does it hurt my chances of getting custody of my children if I move out of the home and leave the children with their other parent?  In short, yes, it probably will hurt your chances of getting custody of your children. Parents that leave the home, even for good reasons, may have a lesser chance of getting custody of the children when it comes time to go to court. By leaving, the judge will see an implied message from the parent's actions. Also, assuming that the parent left the family home, a judge will probably be more inclined to grant custody to the parent that is currently residing in the home so as to disrupt the children's status quo as little as possible.  However, if you take the children when you leave the home, this may send a message to the judge that you are trying to protect your children. If you do move away from home and take the children with you, you need to be sure to go to court as soon as possible so that it does not look like you are attempting to take the children away unlawfully. If you do not set up a court appointment soon after taking the children away from the home, the other parent may ask the judge to take the children away from you as you took them without court authorization.  Who is more likely to be awarded custody of a child, mothers or fathers?  Although it has not always been so, today's courts will generally award custody to whichever parent would be in the best interests of the child. However, in the past, custody of young children (typically under 5 years old) normally went to the mother of the child if the parents divorced. This rule has been phased out in almost every state, and instead, judges must decide on the merits of the case which parent having custody would be in the best interests of the child.  However, just because the rule has been phased out, that does not mean that parents cannot ask a judge to award custody to the mother. Sometimes parents will agree that the mother has more time and inclination to raise the children, and will stipulate to such an order. However, some fathers may only stipulate to this arrangement because they believe that the court already favors the mother, which is not true.  These days, both men and women commonly enter into the workforce full-time, meaning that the custody decision could be as simple as which parent could spend the most time with the child , all other factors being equal. For example, if a father works from home while the mother works a 60+ hour a week job as a corporate attorney, a judge may decide that the best interests of the child are to be with the parent that can spend the most time with the child, which would be the father in this example. Fathers are just as willing and able to be parents as mothers, and they can present that argument in court.  Is custody always awarded to just one parent?  In short, no. It is very common for a court to award partial custody to both parents, otherwise known as joint custody . This type of custody arrangement normally falls into one of three forms. First, joint physical custody is where a court orders a child to spend a substantial amount of time with both parents during the course of the year. Second, joint legal custody is where, although one parent may have full physical custody, both parents must agree on any decisions that impact the child, such as their education, medical care and spiritual matters. Lastly, both joint physical and legal custody is a combination of the first two.  It is ultimately up to the court to decide whether any type of joint custody is in the best interests of a child. However, you, as a parent, have the right to argue for joint custody if you so wish it.  I am a gay or lesbian parent seeking child visitation rights, are there any special considerations I need to take into account?  There are some states that expressly forbid a judge from considering a parent's sexual orientation when deciding a custody dispute. In these states, the best interests of the child must be considered without giving weight to the sexual orientation of either parent.  However, other states do not have such express laws, and gay and lesbian parents may suffer for it. Judges may impose their own community expectations and biases onto a custody dispute involving gay and lesbian parents., It is often the case that a judge will weigh various factors in favor of a non-gay or non-lesbian parent when considering the best interests of the child.  Do judges or courts even consider race to be a factor in child custody hearings?  Courts are not permitted to consider race as a factor when deciding the best interests of the child.  Who will be the person deciding how much child visitation is fair and reasonable?  In general, the parent with primary custodial rights over a child will get to decide what kind of visitation for the other parent is fair and reasonable. In many situations, this works out well for both parents and they can often come to an amicable arrangement regarding visitation hours and days.  However, what is often in the news and on TV is a result of breakdown in communication between the parents. This usually happens when the parent with full custody of a child decides to be vindictive and uses the child as a weapon. To this end, the parent with custody will set the other parent's visiting rights at a bare minimum, often only for a few hours each week during the most inconvenient times.  Some courts are allowing parents to make custody and visitation plans that the judge will sign into law. Parenting agreements, as they are called, are agreed upon visitation schedules and times where the child will be. These parenting agreements can also include plans that deal with how decisions about the child will be made. For example, the agreement could include language that dictates that the parent with custody at the time of a medical emergency can make a decision about the child's health without consulting the other parent first. Parenting agreements are a great idea and you should look into it more carefully if you want to take full advantage of them.  Is mediation better than a court setting for determining child arrangements and getting custody?  Mediation is a great way to come to terms for a custody agreement instead of child custody lawsuits. The process of mediation works when the two parties, most of the time both parents in child custody situations, agree to sit down with a neutral third-party mediator. The mediator's job is to invoke discussion between the two parties and help them come to some middle ground on which to settle.  There are some great advantages to using mediation over litigation. First and foremost, it is a lot cheaper. Mediation often does not require either side to bring an attorney with, not does it require witnesses or other court time. This can save lots of money on both sides. Second, mediation by itself improves communication between the two disputing parties. By opening an honest discussion, many times problems can be resolve and the child will benefit the most by having both parents thinking along the same lines. Lastly, mediation is much faster than litigation. Litigation can often run for several months of court time, during which the fate of your child's upbringing causes you considerable stress. Mediation, on the other hand, often ends in settlement in as little as ten hours of discussion spread over two weeks.  Your local bar association should be able to point you to a local, experienced family law mediation clinic.  Need Help Getting Custody?

It is full of pain, depression, and sadness. However, in some cases, it’s a wise decision, if your life as a married couple has turned into a nightmare. In case there is no love or mutual understanding between spouses, continuing their marriage will hurt both sides. It’s true that things usually get worse when spouses have children. Both parents should indeed make huge efforts to make their divorce process less painful for their children. Actually, when couples make a decision of ending their relationship, men should think about their child custody rights. Are you a father who is seeking a joint custody? Then, you had better go on reading the article to learn about essential tips concerning joint custody.  Showing your active involvement in your kid’s life  If joint custody is what you want, you should do your best to prove that you actively participate in your child’s daily activities. In this case, no judge will ever want to separate you and your child. To achieve this goal consider documenting whatever you do with your kids, including league games, school events, etc.  In other words, any father who shows a high level of interest in his kid’s life has better chances of getting joint custody.  Proving that you are stable   It is vital for a Dad to show his stability when it comes to child custody. What does this mean? Well, if you are the person who earns more money in a family, it may have a positive impact on your case. However, it isn’t the only way of showing stability. An essential thing is having a stable schedule. In other words, you need to show that your kid will have the opportunity of leading a healthy, as well as full life. For example, one of the components of the stable schedule is coming home for having dinner with your kid. In case you succeed in proving your stability, you may good chances of winning the joint custody.  Having an adaptable and flexible schedule  It goes without saying that active participation in your child’s daily life and stability may help you with the child custody case. In addition to that, you should have a flexible schedule. What if one day your child doesn’t feel well? Is your schedule flexible enough to pick up your kid from school? Do you have the opportunity of taking care of your child in case of emergency situations? Even if you have a full-time job, you still need to show that you are available when your kid needs you.  Knowing proper parenting methods  If you are seeking joint custody, knowing the appropriate parenting methods is important. It’s a good idea to refer to any parenting classes, which you attended.  Respecting your child’s mother  Are you looking for a joint custody, then, you should show respect to your kid’s mother. The court will focus on the way you treat your ex-wife. If you are rude to her, you may have fewer chances of obtaining child custody. Try to demonstrate a positive attitude to your spouse. Even if you don’t get on well, showing hostility to her may only harm you. Thus, conceal your negative feelings and try to stay professional and constructive when it comes to child custody arrangements.  Paying attention to the kid’s education  As a good father, you should focus on your child’s education and show your participation in this process. Do you dedicate your time and efforts to help your kid with a homework and you keep in touch with child’s teachers to become aware of his/her academic performance? Do you actively attend your kid’s school events? Demonstrate the judge and social workers that your kid’s education is crucial for you. Moreover, you have a high level of involvement in it. Make sure that they know about your involvement in his/her education.  You need a reliable support network  You probably realize that you need help to deal with your responsibilities as a parent. Although you have to do most of the work, your task will become easier if they assist you. You should demonstrate that you have a reliable support network.  Making child support payments  If you are a dad who is looking for a joint custody, making child support payments on a regular basis is essential. Do you have an informal agreement with your ex-wife concerning child payments? Then, you had better keep all the necessary records, including check receipts. If you find it difficult to pay the informally agreed upon sum of money with your ex-wife, consider the option of requesting for modification.  Creating a strong relationship with your kid  A good father should always know what’s going on in his kid’s life. You need to be one of the primary members of his/her ‘’world.’’ Your child shouldn’t feel your absence in his/her daily life, so you should show that he/she can always rely on you.  Don’t miss any essential school or social activities  The most effective way of demonstrating your interest and involvement in your kid’s life is attending all the events which are special for him/her. This includes social, educational and religious events, like league games, birthday parties, school events, etc. Especially during such activities children feel over the moon when their both parents are supporting them. Thus, the court will take into consideration your attendance as an evidence of a strong relationship with your kid.  You should have a special space for your kid  The court will also take into account your housing conditions. This means that you need to think about preparing s special space for your child in your home. Even if you live in a small house, the kid should have his/her own space there.  In conclusion, fathers who aim to obtain joint custody need an experienced and knowledgeable attorney’s legal assistance. With a reliable lawyer, you can take a breath with ease, as he/she will fight for rights and help you win the child custody case.

Whether you are a father going for full custody or joint custody , you should be prepared for a difficult child custody battle , especially if the child's mother is also filing for custody. Consider the following tips to help a father get custody. Fathers' Child Custody Tips                                                               01  of 10            Pay Child Support Payments        A father who wants custody of a child should continue to make regular child support payments. If a father has an informal arrangement with the child’s mother, he should maintain records such as check receipts or a written letter from the child’s mother as to the child support arrangements and what's been given thus far. If a father is struggling with child support payments, request a modification , but if a father is able to make the payments, he should ensure he has a good track record of ... MORE making payments.              02  of 10            Build a Strong Relationship        When a child is not in the father’s custody, fathers should call the child frequently and check in on the child’s day.  A father may also stop by the child’s school and introduce himself to the administration. A father should check on a child’s progress often and ensure the child knows that he’s there to offer any assistance necessary.              03  of 10            Maintain Accurate Records        A father should maintain an accurate visitation schedule record to help win child custody. Fathers can capture accurate visitation records by developing and maintaining a parenting plan . A father can submit the parenting plan to the court when child custody is decided.              04  of 10            Attend Important School and Social Gatherings        It’s important for a father who wants custody to attend the child’s social, educational, religious and other important events as evidence of a continuing relationship with the child. Examples of important events are school plays, baptisms, birthday parties and sporting events.  A court will rely on this attendance as evidence of a meaningful relationship.       Continue to 5 of 10 below.                  05  of 10            Prepare a Space For Your Child in Your Home        Even if a father lives in a small space, he should make a special place in his home for the child.  A court will inquire about adequate living accommodations during all hearings for child custody. Fathers should be prepared to respond to the judge’s inquiry regarding housing plans.              06  of 10            Have a Plan        A judge will expect a father to be prepared for child custody, in case child custody is awarded. Fathers should compile intelligent responses to potential questions that are asked by a judge . For example, a judge will ask questions about living accommodations, the child's education including after-school activities and financial preparedness.              07  of 10            Be Respectful        A father who wants custody of a child should remember to always respect the mother of his child. The way a father treats the mother of his child may be a factor in determining child custody. Fathers who are disrespectful or rude to the child's mother will also affect the child, along with the father's chances of obtaining child custody.              08  of 10            Be Honest With Yourself        A father who wants custody of a child should realistically ask himself what he can handle. It's a fact that many fathers may have other responsibilities such as other children or multiple jobs. Multiple responsibilities may affect a father's ability to assume custody of a child, especially full custody.       Continue to 9 of 10 below.                  09  of 10            When In Doubt, Ask Someone Wiser Than You        A father who wants custody of a child should speak to others who have been through the child custody process.  A father who has been through the child custody process can offer insight and let a father who is going through the process know what to expect.              10  of 10            Consider Mediation or Arbitration        A father who wants custody of a child should consider mediation or arbitration , prior to undergoing an adversarial court hearing.  In mediation or arbitration, cases are decided by a neutral third party.  For a father, custody proceedings in a courtroom may be difficult to handle, so he may prefer the smaller, friendlier setting associated with mediation or arbitration.

Joint Custody as a Consideration (Provided by How to Win Child Custody )   Joint custody is a wonderful concept that is difficult to achieve.  It requires two very special parents concerned enough about their children to put their own disputes aside when it comes to the children.  While it requires a major commitment and a great deal lot of work, it is more than worth the effort if you realize even part of its promise. Rather than shooting for the moon, and programming a likely failure to achieve the ideal joint custody, strive instead for the more attainable aspects that most easily fit your established lifestyles.  Begin by loosening up a little when working with each other on your proposed custody plan.  Be cautious with the way you characterize your roles: each of you are undeniably a parent and you are preparing a parenting plan.  Avoid primary/secondary, custodial/noncustodial and custody/visitation distinctions as much as possible.  Don’t lock yourself into a weekend/weekday schedule.  Consider trying something a little different, such as Sunday morning through Wednesday evening with one parent, and the balance of the week with the other.  Your children can in fact have two homes.  You’ve done it! Shared, joint and split custody all refer to variations on a theme in which each parent cares for the children one-third to one-half of the time, although each has its own nuances.  Shared often infers that the non-custodial parent has the children thirty to forty percent of the time, with a primary parent identifiable in the custody plan.  Joint invariably means approximately equal caretaking and equal responsibility for the children, requiring considerable flexibility and especially parents that can work together.  Split usually indicates a fixed schedule, such as three days with one parent and four with the other every week, with nearly equal parental caring and responsibility.  Our discussion will focus on joint custodythe most idealistic and furthest removed from traditional custody plans ordered by the courts. In actual practice, joint custody often requires parents to cooperate more with their spouses after separation than they did during the marriage.  You’ll have to work together to avoid schedule and discipline conflicts.  You must be flexible enough to help the other parent out when needed, because there will be times when you’ll need the help yourself.  You may want to include the rather common provision that you’ll give the other parent the first option to watch the children if you’ll be gone overnight.  On the other hand, you may decide to prefer the use of babysitters when one of you out for just an evening.  Working together, you’ll be far more involved in decisions about school, medical care, and extra activities such as band, sports and dating than you would if just one of you was a primary parent. Build a solid record of involvement with your children from your first day of separation if you even think you might desire joint custody.  Joint custody doesn’t just fall into place; if your spouse won’t agree, you’ll have to go to court.  It’s too late if you really didn’t get to know your own children during the marriage, or learn how to care for them.  Start now, of course, but don’t expect to automatically receive joint custody.  One of the major considerations is parenting skill, and if you don’t have any just yet youre in trouble.  The court is concerned about your children’s best interests, not yours.  The low expectations of many family law courts, based on experience with failed joint custody experiments, is another reason to remain realistic about your chances for joint custodyand to build a factual record to show why it should be given a chance in your case. Case Scenario: Irv wisely never permitted any interruption in the time that he spent with his children.  His efforts paid off with an agreement giving him the children half the time.  He arranged immediately on separation to have his children stay with him at his parents while he looked for a new place to live.  He took his children to preschool before he went to work on mornings that they stayed with him.  He picked them up when he had them again.  When he rented a suitable place to live, the children were still part of his life and moved right in, half time, of course. Don’t forget the economics of joint custody.  Typical mandatory child support schedules assume that the children are with the non-custodial parent twenty percent of the time.  If you have them more than that, no adjustment in child support will be made until, usually, your time exceeds thirty percent.  Do the calculations for your local court schedule; if you are at twenty-eight percent, add a little time to your side and you’ll probably save hundreds of dollars every month. The best way to end up with joint custody is to start with it.  What ifas much as you want joint custodynothing is going right?  Assume for this example that your spouse wants to be the primary parent.  You’ve tried, but can’t reach a compromise.  Your attorney says that you do have a fair chance of getting joint custody.  Act now! Your chances won’t get any better.  Take an aggressive stance.  A court hearing now for temporary custody pending a long-term custody order by settlement or trial will be relatively low key and less expensive than trial.  You have a better chance of getting a joint custody order now, if you have the facts, than later.  Some order must be made at this time because of the parents separation, and up until the time of the hearing the children have been living with you both.  However, the same rule applies to primary custody: what the children have become comfortably accustomed to is likely to be continued. What conditions are favorable for joint custody?  An ideal joint custody situation would require each parent to have a room for their child, with all clothes, toys and other necessary items.  Each of these parents would live in the same school district, and close enough to each other so their child could visit the same friends no matter which home he or she was at.  The two parents would get along so well the child would hardly be aware there had been a divorce.  No one is going to meet this ideal.  Perfect joint custody situations after divorce are rare.  But no one, not the legislature that makes the laws and not the court that interprets the laws, said you had to be perfect. Many situations within your reach are quite suitable for joint custody.  The most important factor is the ability of the parents to work together.  Rooms and toys and clothes and transportation are all secondary to the desire of the parents to make it work.  A parent opposed to joint custody has the power to stifle it because this opposition alone means joint custody won’t work.  However, this same sabotaging parent runs the risk in exercising this power that he or she will be seen to be "less likely to share the child with the other parent" and thus end up being the secondary parent under a traditional plan.  Thus, the parent seeking joint custody just might be rewarded with far more, namely primary custody.

I got a girl who I was just having fun with pregnant. We never really dated or were in any type of committed relationship. At the time she told me I had nothing to worry about and a week later she is pregnant. My mistake there but I can't turn back the hands of time. Me and her didn't really talk during her pregnancy, she wanted me to buy her maternity clothes and wait on her hand and foot, something I had zero interest in. I hired an attorney who is a family friend who attempted to get her to stipulate some type of agreement months prior to the child's birth. The mother ignored these attempts and claimed she was trying to enjoy her pregnancy and didn't need the stress.  As time went on and the birth of the child got closer I  eventually retained this attorney and filed an order. I requested the OC guideline visitation schedule, to pay her child support based off of guideline, get my last name on the birth certificate (it's a boy and she claims she would change it after 1yr of me showing consistency to her) I am asking for 50% split of everything. I also asked for attorney fees (something doesn't sound like I will get) After filing this order she has a family friend who started doing family law recently contact my attorney claiming he is her attorney but hasn't subbed in as the attorney of record on the case. This guy continues to contact my lawyer racking up my attorney fees. The calls lead to nothing, the only offer given so far was all visitation at her house under her supervision for the first year. We are both first time parents, no history of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse on my end. She is 4yrs sober out of the AA program for drinking but never entered a facility.  Really this whole thing has been about her feelings and having a level of control over me. She knows had the child not be involved I would be long gone as I have no interest in even being a friend of hers.  Now the child has been born and I didn't find out until a few days later by looking at her Instagram profile. I was quite enraged and reached out to her stating I felt it was extremely selfish and self-centered she didn't let me know. That same day I left a bunch of gifts for him on her doorstep and she invited me in. For about 3 weeks I have seen him and her almost every day for an average of 5hrs a day (I log all visits) She acts as if we are going to be together, flirting and such. I deflect all of this and make my focus about the baby.  We had a mediation appointment scheduled a few days prior to the child birth (I didn't choose the date, it was assigned) and she no show/no called. Our court date is in 2 days and she asked me to delay it, I told her I didnt want to delay things any longer and wanted to get this done and out of the way. Since then she has pretty much stopped sending me pictures of him or even communicating with me. She says I can see the kid but I have to be around her which she has made extremely uncomfortable. Her attorney is going to go to court on Tuesday and ask to have this delayed, likely act like he is new to the case yet he has been in contact with my attorney for a month. To top it off the guy retires in a few weeks.  What can I do? My attorney has already racked up so much in fees and we havent even been to court yet! I asked her to stop communicating with this guy because it goes no where and just costs me money but she continues to claim she has to. I am just extremely confused (and depressed) here I am wanting to be involved in my son's life yet because I won't be with the mother I am punished. Where as a father do I have a right? It seems so one-sided to me. If we go to court on Tuesday and its delayed I just have to wait? How am I to bond with my newborn son other than kissing her ass? So many cases it seems like the father is a dead beat, in jail, refusing to pay child support and here I am doing the exact opposite and still being treated like I am a POS because I don't want to be with the mother. Any hope or words of wisdom? PLEASE!                          12-14-2014, 09:30 PM    #2         Dogmatique    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Senior Member        Join Date  Apr 2009  Location  Somewhere near Canada  Posts  35,853         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance           Quoting hokeyplayer    My question involves a child custody case from the State of: California  So here is my dilemma and I am not sure of what to do anymore.

At the time she told me I had nothing to worry about and a week later she is pregnant. My mistake there but I can't turn back the hands of time. Me and her didn't really talk during her pregnancy, she wanted me to buy her maternity clothes and wait on her hand and foot, something I had zero interest in.     Congratulations!   You're going to be tied with her for the next.. 18 years or so.       I hired an attorney who is a family friend who attempted to get her to stipulate some type of agreement months prior to the child's birth.    Before paternity was legally established?       The mother ignored these attempts and claimed she was trying to enjoy her pregnancy and didn't need the stress.    No stress is very good for Mom and baby.        As time went on and the birth of the child got closer I  eventually retained this attorney and filed an order. I requested the OC guideline visitation schedule, to pay her child support based off of guideline, get my last name on the birth certificate (it's a boy and she claims she would change it after 1yr of me showing consistency to her) I am asking for 50% split of everything.    By split,   I presume you mean financially?   There is no law requiring Mom to give the child your name.       I also asked for attorney fees (something doesn't sound like I will get) After filing this order she has a family friend who started doing family law recently contact my attorney claiming he is her attorney but hasn't subbed in as the attorney of record on the case.    Attorney fees?   No.       This guy continues to contact my lawyer racking up my attorney fees. The calls lead to nothing, the only offer given so far was all visitation at her house under her supervision for the first year. We are both first time parents, no history of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse on my end. She is 4yrs sober out of the AA program for drinking but never entered a facility.    And your counter-offer was... ?        Really this whole thing has been about her feelings and having a level of control over me. She knows had the child not be involved I would be long gone as I have no interest in even being a friend of hers.    Well,  that sometime happens.    Can't change it now.        Now the child has been born and I didn't find out until a few days later by looking at her Instagram profile. I was quite enraged and reached out to her stating I felt it was extremely selfish and self-centered she didn't let me know.    Given that paternity hasn't been established yet,   you have a bit of a nerve getting upset with her.    Kiddo isn't yours legally until that happens.       That same day I left a bunch of gifts for him on her doorstep and she invited me in. For about 3 weeks I have seen him and her almost every day for an average of 5hrs a day (I log all visits) She acts as if we are going to be together, flirting and such. I deflect all of this and make my focus about the baby.    Very gentlemanly of you.       We had a mediation appointment scheduled a few days prior to the child birth (I didn't choose the date, it was assigned) and she no show/no called. Our court date is in 2 days and she asked me to delay it, I told her I didnt want to delay things any longer and wanted to get this done and out of the way. Since then she has pretty much stopped sending me pictures of him or even communicating with me.    That's entirely up to her.       She says I can see the kid but I have to be around her which she has made extremely uncomfortable.    Be careful.   You might end up paying for a visitation center.       Her attorney is going to go to court on Tuesday and ask to have this delayed, likely act like he is new to the case yet he has been in contact with my attorney for a month. To top it off the guy retires in a few weeks.  What can I do? My attorney has already racked up so much in fees and we havent even been to court yet! I asked her to stop communicating with this guy because it goes no where and just costs me money but she continues to claim she has to. I am just extremely confused (and depressed) here I am wanting to be involved in my son's life yet because I won't be with the mother I am punished. Where as a father do I have a right? It seems so one-sided to me. If we go to court on Tuesday and its delayed I just have to wait?    Pretty much,  yeap.       How am I to bond with my newborn son other than kissing her ass? So many cases it seems like the father is a dead beat, in jail, refusing to pay child support and here I am doing the exact opposite and still being treated like I am a POS because I don't want to be with the mother. Any hope or words of wisdom? PLEASE!    Visitation is commonly at the primary caregiver's abode for at least some time.  Other than that,  I didn't actually see much in the way of a question.  Paternity will be established,   you can file for joint legal custody,   and enjoy your child.   - - - Updated - - -  One more thing.     You have homework!   http://www.occourts.org/directory/family/  That will be able to go much further into detail.

Yes this was before paternity was established. She claims I am the father why would we need the legal portion done if I am the father to at least start drawing up a plan?   No stress is very good for Mom and baby.  I understand this, but I am not the one causing the stress. She is using the child for control, thus causing her own stress by me putting my foot down.

I understand there isn't a law for this, but its a boy. I am the only one left to carry on my family name, other than control (requiring "consistency" for a year) why not just put my name now?   And your counter-offer was... ?  My counter offer was hell no, that’s a joke. I have been to parenting classes and am a first time parent just like her, not sure what gives her a supervisor right to my parenting. My offer is OC guidelines, she came with something completely from left field, offer something a tad bit more reasonable and we can discuss negotiation.   Given that paternity hasn't been established yet, you have a bit of a nerve getting upset with her. Kiddo isn't yours legally until that happens.  A bit of nerve? She claims I am the father, what does the court have to do with anything when it comes to seeing your newborn child?   Pretty much, yeap.  You have added to my depression with that response. How is this so one-sided? I just want to be involved in my child's life with minimal interaction with her. I don't want to be mean to her, I just don't want to kiss her ass either. My focus is the child that is it. I am a good person, no troubled past, she has told me many times when she thought we would be in a relationship I am going to be a great father. When she thinks we will be together, she is very nice to me and speaks highly of me. When I make it clear I don't want that she punishes me via the child. Does the court pay attention to these things? I know the child is the focus on the court but do they care to see how a mother uses the child for manipulation?

You will have to play catch-up.  You may well have to pay support and suffer through supervised or very limited visitation for a while.  When the child gets older, you may very well be able to have longer visitations, but so long as the child is an infant, chances are your time and access will be somewhat limited.  This is one of the consequences of a frivolous lifestyle, and one that you have to be prepared to accept for engaging in it.  Like it or not, you are tied to mom for the next 18+ years - perhaps all the way through college (assuming he goes to college).  So, settle in, it's gonna be a long and bumpy ride.    ********** Retired Cal Cop Sergeant & Teacher   Seek justice, Love mercy, Walk humbly with your God -- Courageous , by Casting Crowns ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkM-gDcmJeM                      12-14-2014, 10:43 PM    #5         hokeyplayer    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Junior Member        Join Date  Jan 2010  Posts  5         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance    Is this guideline total BS?   http://www.occourts.org/media/pdf/pa...guidelines.pdf  Its all I am asking for                        12-14-2014, 11:05 PM    #6         cdwjava    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Senior Member        Join Date  Sep 2005  Location  California  Posts  19,568         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance    The guidelines are just that: Guidelines.  They do not bind the parents, the court, or the facilitators into any one course of action.  These may be the intended goals, but, a lot depends on the outcomes of meetings with facilitators and the court.    ********** Retired Cal Cop Sergeant & Teacher   Seek justice, Love mercy, Walk humbly with your God -- Courageous , by Casting Crowns ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkM-gDcmJeM                      12-14-2014, 11:21 PM    #7         Dogmatique    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Senior Member        Join Date  Apr 2009  Location  Somewhere near Canada  Posts  35,853         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance           Quoting hokeyplayer    In reply to your questions   Before paternity was legally established?  Yes this was before paternity was established. She claims I am the father why would we need the legal portion done if I am the father to at least start drawing up a plan?     You're putting the cart before the horse - and you NEED that DNA test before you sign a darned thing.    I cannot count the number of single Dads who come here thinking they were the father,  eventually finding that they're not,   and having no recourse to change anything.         No stress is very good for Mom and baby.  I understand this, but I am not the one causing the stress. She is using the child for control, thus causing her own stress by me putting my foot down.    Or seen another way,   you're just one more lousy ex who keeps bugging her for reason.     You have no feet to put down.    She doesn't even need to acknowledge your existence before she's served with a suit and if she's as petty as you're making her out to be,   she's going to present herself as the most perfect New Mommy in OC.         By split, I presume you mean financially? There is no law requiring Mom to give the child your name.  I mean visitation & financially when I mention 50%. I understand there isn't a law for this, but its a boy. I am the only one left to carry on my family name, other than control (requiring "consistency" for a year) why not just put my name now?    You're not going to get a literal 50/50 timeshare.   Joint legal (decision-making) is realistic,  and you'll also  be paying guideline support.   The name issue?   promising you a "maybe"  could well be a simple attempt by Mom to just get you off her back,  in all honesty.         And your counter-offer was... ?  My counter offer was hell no, that’s a joke. I have been to parenting classes and am a first time parent just like her, not sure what gives her a supervisor right to my parenting. My offer is OC guidelines, she came with something completely from left field, offer something a tad bit more reasonable and we can discuss negotiation.    Two things.   First,  you need to understand what those guidelines mean.    They are guidelines - and nothing more.    If one of you is acting like an ass,   the court can very easily snap that parent right back into grade-school and wishing they'd never bothered debating the issue in the first place.  Second,  and you better start getting used to this,   is that she doesn't have to negotiate a darned thing....and if she's feeling as pressured as you're making her feel,  she's going to shut you down.     And don't think for one second that she'll automatically be in the wrong.       Given that paternity hasn't been established yet, you have a bit of a nerve getting upset with her. Kiddo isn't yours legally until that happens.  A bit of nerve? She claims I am the father, what does the court have to do with anything when it comes to seeing your newborn child?    Because it isn't your child until paternity is legally established.   Everything - and I do mean everything - is up to her at this point.         Pretty much, yeap.  You have added to my depression with that response. How is this so one-sided? I just want to be involved in my child's life with minimal interaction with her.    Marriage.    That's honestly the brutal truth.    Without that,   she's in charge at least in the short term.       I don't want to be mean to her, I just don't want to kiss her ass either. My focus is the child that is it. I am a good person, no troubled past, she has told me many times when she thought we would be in a relationship I am going to be a great father. When she thinks we will be together, she is very nice to me and speaks highly of me. When I make it clear I don't want that she punishes me via the child. Does the court pay attention to these things? I know the child is the focus on the court but do they care to see how a mother uses the child for manipulation?    You want the God's honest truth?   You're not really in a bargaining position at the moment.     You are curious,  and excited,  and want to spend as much time as possible with this child.    It's just that you're going about this the wrong way.    You're not in a position of power here - Mom is.   Everything at this point is up to her.  Look,  as Carl is suggesting,   you're already at a disadvantage simply because you weren't married to Mom.    We know she's Mom,  because there are likely 20 people in the delivery room taking video of the joyous event.    But we don't know who Dad is.    If you were married,  you'd automatically be the presumed father and you'd stand equal before the court.  As that's not the case,  yes - you're playing catch-up.    The court won't penalize Mom for not giving in to your offer and while I know you're going to HATE this...if she's savvy (and/or vindictive) enough she can quite literally have some other guy sign the AOP just to make your life that much more difficult.  Is it legal for her to do this?    Absolutely not Is it right?    NO But can she get away with it?   Yes,  unfortunately.    And no matter what you might have in terms of prior agreements,   the court has to sort out who's who and that just takes even longer.  Please take this in the manner intended.    Cool your jets.    Get rid of the belief that you're the one with the negotiating power - because you're not.    If she feels pushed,  or slighted,  or thwarted,   you're setting yourself up for failure even though you're really not doing anything wrong.    The last thing you want is to start this out as a contentious coparenting relationship.     If you're the rational one,   then be rational.    Once things are in place,  you'll be in a much,  much stronger position.  Y'know?

QUESTION  What are the chances of my ex husband getting joint custody of our two children?  Asked on Sep 14th, 2011 on Child Custody - New Jersey      More details to this question:  I am getting a divorce and my husband wants joint custody of our 2 small children.  I do not feel comfortable letting my children spend more time than necessary with him.  He has never changed a diaper, fed them a meal, put them to bed, etc.  He doesn't know what it takes to care for a child.  He does have custody of a child he had out of wedlock five years ago, but I believe he only got custody because we were married and the mother of the five year old couldn't hold down a job and moved around a lot.  Me and the kids are temporarily living with my parents until I can get a job and get our own place.  My soon to be ex husband has a girlfriend already and she has a 3 year old son.  I do not want my kids involved in this mixed-up, confusing situation that my husband has put us in.  I wanted to work this out with him and have tried to get him to go to counseling but he would rather have his girlfriend.  What chance does he have to get joint custody?      Report

It is typically presumed that custody should be joint, so you will need to be prepared to show the judge why he should award primary custody.   An attorney can assist you in preparing evidence and understanding which facts would be important to the judge.         Report

Custody is typically joint, it is the placement schedule that is important. In Wisconsin, many factors are considered. Using mediation as the way to proceed through your divorce, or at least a child specialist to help map out a parenting agreement, is highly recommended.         Report

Even fathers who have been fairly reluctant in the past are often given a new chance when a divorce occurs, especially where they come forward and fight for custody. You should consult with an attorney immediately.         Report

As for placement, the statutes require maximizing placement with both parents so it is likely that you will end up with a shared placement situation.         Report

The goal of the courts is that each parent have frequent and continuing contact with the children.  Courts will look at which parent is more likely to facilitate a relationship with the other parent when determining custody. If you have concerns about his parenting, you may present those issues to the court. He may be required to take a parenting class. You should probably retain an attorney so that you can present a clear argument to the court.  In the long run, however your ex husband may end up having joint custody of the children if the court deems that it is in their best interests.         Report

Shared parenting is not about the time the children spend with each parent, but about joint decision making.  With shared parenting, you and your husband have to discuss and agree upon the important decisions in your children's lives, such as medical treatment, school placement, extracurricular activities, religious training, and disciplinary measures.  To avoid shared parenting, you would need to show the court that you and your husband cannot make decision together regarding your children, that your husband does not make good decisions for your children, or that there is  history of domestic violence.

He will probably do very well because judges abhor hearing a parent say what you said the way you said it.  It is VITAL that you get a lawyer, who can properly present the same arguments in a way that will improve your chances, rather than how you presented it.         Report

If you are using the term as referring simply to describe whether or not the child will spend any time with the father, it is almost certain that the father will be awarded some amount of "parenting time".  It is very unlikely that a court will deny him any time with the child.  Colorado's system expects that a comprehensive Parenting Plan will be developed and ordered by the court.  If you and the father cannot agree to a suitable Plan, the Court will establish a Plan based on what it considers is best for the child.  As a starting point, the court will presume that what is best for a child is to have two, loving, caring parents involved in parenting.  That means the Plan will have deal with how much time the child will spend in each parent's home, who makes the decisions, and who has what responsibilities.         Report

Posted By The Buncher Law Corporation    When most entertainment media cover the topic of divorce or family law disputes , there seems to almost always be a father figure cast in a negative light.
	 How many movies have you watched that included an abusive dad that couldn’t
	 control his temper? Or, how many television shows have you seen that presented
	 the mother as a caring, protective figure and the dad too strict and authoritarian?
	 While we all understand that these are only character tropes, the effects
	 of this near-constant representation of fathers in the media has trickled
	 into our country’s legal system, making child custody and visitation cases an uphill battle for men, in many cases.  Historically, family law judges have favored women when it comes to awarding
	 child custody. This is due to the prevailing assumption that women are
	 nurturing by nature and men are not. The saying goes, “A mother
	 always knows,” not a father. Even though some states have passed
	 legislation that specifically states family law courts cannot intentionally
	 side with mothers in child custody disputes, these updated changes seem
	 to have done little to the subconscious decision making process of some
	 judges. By some rough estimates, about 60% of cases wherein sole or primary
	 custody is awarded to one parent (as opposed to joint custody to be shared
	 by both) mother is awarded custody, despite the father appearing to be
	 just as eligible, if not more so, to carry that responsibility.  If the odds seem unfairly stacked against fathers due to society’s
	 predispositions and centuries of common practice, how can a dad fight
	 for his right to sole or primary child custody, and win ?  What Fathers Can Do to Win Child Custody  Put aside possible biases against fathers in divorce and you will find
	 that all family law courts, no matter what state you are in, are supposed
	 to rule in favor of “the child’s best interests.” A
	 child’s best interests boil down to which parent will most likely
	 be able to provide a stable home and loving lifestyle for the child, which
	 in turn will encourage positive development. A parent’s sex or gender is not included in the language of these laws. This is where a father will need
	 to focus his efforts in the dispute: proving he can provide what is best
	 for his child or children.  To establish that you, the father of your child, deserve sole or primary
		 child custody, you should start by thinking of three things:    How your child sees you: The biggest help to your argument for sole or primary child custody is
		 your child himself or herself. Children will tend to prefer the parent
		 that has given them the most attention, even if this is not stated openly.
		 If you were the one who picks up your kids from school, takes them to
		 the doctor, and reads them bedtime stories, your child is going to miss
		 that routine and sense of normalcy should it disappear after your divorce.
		 In order to avoid damaging that comfort zone, a court will likely reward
		 sole or primary custody to you.   Your relationship with your wife: Along the same vein of keeping the status quo of your child’s day-to-day
		 life undisturbed, family law courts prefer, if possible, that a child
		 still see both parents frequently. If you have maintained a civil relationship
		 with your wife despite the divorce process unfolding, it looks good. In
		 fact, if you have been careful to not overstep your boundaries or onto
		 your wife’s toes, you in particular look good in the eyes of the court, as it wants a child
		 to grow up under the care of someone who is level headed.   Future relationships and situations: The court will look beyond the here and the now when rewarding child custody.
		 If you plan on living with some friends while looking for a place of your
		 own, the personalities of those new people and your overall living situation
		 must be considered as well. Are you interested in pursuing new partners
		 after the divorce? The court may not appreciate that venture as much as
		 you do. In essence, any behavior that could be seen as that of a “bachelor”
		 is not the same as that of a father & it can hurt your odds of getting
		 sole or primary child custody.   Considerations Dealing with More Concrete Information  With the three “abstract” considerations considered, it is
	 time to actually look at concrete evidence and numbers to improve your
	 chances of getting full custody as a father. What do you have at your
	 disposal and that is on paper that can help your argument? Sometimes a
	 properly sorted portfolio is the difference between raising your kids
	 every day and wondering when you will see them next.  Information and data you can use to sway the court’s decision in
		 your favor include:   Your regular income – you can afford to raise a child.  Your regular (and flexible) work schedule – you have the time to
		 raise a child.  Your clean criminal record – you have the right temperament to raise a child.  Your medical history – you have the health needed to raise a child.   If all of these look good on your end but not so much on your wife’s
	 end, get copies of her information, too. A side-by-side comparison of
	 objective information can be powerful in proving you are prepared to continue
	 being a father, and that your soon-to-be ex-wife needs to spend more time
	 focusing on herself.  Hold Onto Your Family Home If You Can  Finally, you must realize the importance of staying in your family home
	 as the divorce unfolds. You should never automatically concede and move
	 out unless staying poses a risk to your health, such as in incidents of domestic violence . If you pack up and leave the moment a divorce is announced, leaving your
	 kids to stay with your wife in your home, you have just created the new
	 normal for your children, which is living with their mother and not their
	 father. A judge will, once again, not want to upset a child any further
	 and will lean towards awarding child custody to whomever stayed in the
	 family home, out of simplicity’s sake. Should you be given a temporary
	 court order to vacate your marital home, you should start thinking immediately
	 as to how you can reverse it.  Irvine Divorce Lawyers Standing Up for Fathers’ Rights  Our team of family law attorneys in Irvine believe that the law should not be tilted

Share on Google Plus       Share on Facebook              Physical Custody  Physical custody means that a parent has the right to have a child live with him or her. Some states will award joint physical custody when the child spends significant amounts of time with both parents. Joint physical custody works best if parents live relatively close to each other, as it lessens the stress on children and allows them to maintain a somewhat normal routine.  Where the child lives primarily with one parent and has visitation with the other, generally the parent with whom the child primarily lives (called the "custodial" parent) will have sole or primary physical custody, and the other parent (the noncustodial parent) will have the right to visitation or parenting time with his or her child.  Legal Custody  Legal custody of a child means having the right and the obligation to make decisions about a child's upbringing. A parent with legal custody can make decisions about the child's schooling, religious upbringing and medical care, for example. In many states, courts regularly award joint legal custody, which means that the decision making is shared by both parents.  If you share joint legal custody with the other parent and you exclude him or her from the decision-making process, your ex can take you back to court and ask the judge to enforce the custody agreement. You won't get fined or go to jail, but it will probably be embarrassing and cause more friction between the two of you -- which may harm the children. What's more, if you're represented by an attorney, it's sure to be expensive.  If you believe the circumstances between you and your child's other parent make it impossible to share joint legal custody (the other parent won't communicate with you about important matters or is abusive), you can go to court and ask for sole legal custody. But, in many states, joint legal custody is preferred, so you will have to convince a family court judge that it is not in the best interests of your child.  To learn more about child custody and how it is determined in your state, see the Child Custody & Paternity section on DivorceNet.com (part of the Nolo network of legal websites).  Sole Custody  One parent can have either sole legal custody or sole physical custody of a child. Courts generally won't hesitate to award sole physical custody to one parent if the other parent is deemed unfit -- for example, because of alcohol or drug dependency or charges of child abuse or neglect.  However, in most states, courts are moving away from awarding sole custody to one parent and toward enlarging the role both parents play in their children's lives. Even where courts do award sole physical custody, the parties often still share joint legal custody, and the noncustodial parent enjoys a generous visitation schedule. In these situations, the parents would make joint decisions about the child's upbringing, but one parent would be deemed the primary physical caretaker, while the other parent would have visitation rights under a parenting agreement or schedule.  It goes without saying that there may be animosity between you and your soon-to-be ex-spouse. But it's best not to seek sole custody unless the other parent truly causes direct harm to the children. Even then, courts may still allow the other parent supervised visitation.  Joint Custody  Parents who don't live together have joint custody (also called shared custody) when they share the decision-making responsibilities for, and/or physical control and custody of, their children. Joint custody can exist if the parents are divorced, separated, or no longer cohabiting, or even if they never lived together. Joint custody may be:   joint legal custody  joint physical custody (where the children spend a significant portion of time with each parent), or  joint legal and physical custody.   Find information on Child Custody: Best Interests of the Child laws in your state.  Joint Custody Arrangements  When parents share joint custody, they usually work out a schedule according to their work requirements, housing arrangements and the children's needs. If the parents cannot agree on a schedule, the court will impose an arrangement. A common pattern is for children to split weeks between each parent's house or apartment. Other joint physical custody arrangements include:   alternating months, years, or six-month periods, or  spending weekends and holidays with one parent, while spending weekdays with the other.   There is even a joint custody arrangement where the children remain in the family home and the parents take turns moving in and out, spending their out time in separate housing of their own. This is commonly called "bird's nest custody" or "nesting."  Pros and Cons of Joint Custody  Joint custody has the advantages of assuring the children continuing contact and involvement with both parents. And it alleviates some of the burdens of parenting for each parent.  There are, of course, disadvantages:   Children must be shuttled around.  Parental noncooperation or ill will can have seriously negative effects on children.  Maintaining two homes for the children can be expensive.   If you have a joint custody arrangement, maintain detailed and organized financial records of your expenses. Keep receipts for groceries, school and after-school activities, clothing and medical care. At some point, your ex may claim he or she has spent more money on the kids than you have, and a judge will appreciate your detailed records.

A parent may be deemed unfit if they have been abusive, neglected, or failed to provide proper care for the child. A parent with a mental disturbance or addiction to drugs or alcohol may also be found to be an unfit parent. Failure to visit, provide support, or incarceration are other examples of grounds for being found unfit.  For example, one state declares the power of the juvenile court to terminate the rights of a natural parent (a) who was "unfit or incompetent by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child," (b) who "abandoned the child," or (c) who "substantially and continuously or repeatedly refused or failed to give the child proper parental care and protection."  Some state laws provide for a fitness hearing to be held after an adjudication of neglect, dependency or abuse. In such cases, the law may specify a time period after such an adjudication in which the parent may make efforts to resolve the problem, such as seeking drug or alcohol treatment. A parent's failure to make reasonable efforts and progress within the specifed time frame is a ground of unfitness. Local laws should be consulted for specific requirements in your area.  The court will often award sole custody to the other parent when one parent is deemed unfit, or if both parents are deemed unfit, the child may be placed in foster care. Evidence of parental unfitness toward one child may be grounds for terminating the parental rights to other children even though the parent never abused or neglected those children. The best interest of the child is the determining factor.  In determining the child's best interest, one court has stated that it shall consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:  (i) The willingness of the parent or parents to receive or care for
the child; (ii) That the child has been removed from the custody of the parent
by temporary order of the court for a period of six months and further
finds that: (A) The conditions which led to the removal still exist; (B) There is little likelihood that those conditions will be remedied
at an early date so that the child can be returned to the parent in the
near future; and (C) The continuation of the parent-child relationship greatly diminishes
the child's prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent
home ....

But getting custody of your child requires an understanding of the various factors considered by family courts. What follows are some of the most frequently asked questions we get regarding child custody, joint custody, child visitation, and family law.  When considering who should get custody of a child, what factors does a court look at?  In almost all situations, a court will keep one primary question in mind when deciding a custody case, namely, what is in the best interests of the child ? To answer this question, courts generally look at a number of different factors, such as:   A parent's financial and physical ability to provide a child with essentials like food, medical care, shelter and clothing A parent's medical history, both physical and mental The child's age, sex and medical history, both physical and mental A parent's vocation and habits, including things like excessive drinking or smoking The child's choice if the child is of a certain age, normally 12 years old The emotional bond between child and parent The wishes of both parents The willingness of each parent to support the child's relationship with the other parent The level of adjustment needed from the child if forced to move to a new school, city, or state, and The quality of life the child enjoys in the child's current status quo, and Whether any parent has brought false or malicious charges of child abuse on the other parent.  If, upon looking at all of these factors, a court cannot decide what is in the best interests of the child, courts normally tend to look closely at which parent would most likely provide the child with a stable household. This can vary depending on the child's age. If the child is young, custody may go to the primary caregiver. However, if the child is older, custody may be awarded to the parent that is better situated to provide the child with access to education, friends, and social development.  Does it hurt my chances of getting custody of my children if I move out of the home and leave the children with their other parent?  In short, yes, it probably will hurt your chances of getting custody of your children. Parents that leave the home, even for good reasons, may have a lesser chance of getting custody of the children when it comes time to go to court. By leaving, the judge will see an implied message from the parent's actions. Also, assuming that the parent left the family home, a judge will probably be more inclined to grant custody to the parent that is currently residing in the home so as to disrupt the children's status quo as little as possible.  However, if you take the children when you leave the home, this may send a message to the judge that you are trying to protect your children. If you do move away from home and take the children with you, you need to be sure to go to court as soon as possible so that it does not look like you are attempting to take the children away unlawfully. If you do not set up a court appointment soon after taking the children away from the home, the other parent may ask the judge to take the children away from you as you took them without court authorization.  Who is more likely to be awarded custody of a child, mothers or fathers?  Although it has not always been so, today's courts will generally award custody to whichever parent would be in the best interests of the child. However, in the past, custody of young children (typically under 5 years old) normally went to the mother of the child if the parents divorced. This rule has been phased out in almost every state, and instead, judges must decide on the merits of the case which parent having custody would be in the best interests of the child.  However, just because the rule has been phased out, that does not mean that parents cannot ask a judge to award custody to the mother. Sometimes parents will agree that the mother has more time and inclination to raise the children, and will stipulate to such an order. However, some fathers may only stipulate to this arrangement because they believe that the court already favors the mother, which is not true.  These days, both men and women commonly enter into the workforce full-time, meaning that the custody decision could be as simple as which parent could spend the most time with the child , all other factors being equal. For example, if a father works from home while the mother works a 60+ hour a week job as a corporate attorney, a judge may decide that the best interests of the child are to be with the parent that can spend the most time with the child, which would be the father in this example. Fathers are just as willing and able to be parents as mothers, and they can present that argument in court.  Is custody always awarded to just one parent?  In short, no. It is very common for a court to award partial custody to both parents, otherwise known as joint custody . This type of custody arrangement normally falls into one of three forms. First, joint physical custody is where a court orders a child to spend a substantial amount of time with both parents during the course of the year. Second, joint legal custody is where, although one parent may have full physical custody, both parents must agree on any decisions that impact the child, such as their education, medical care and spiritual matters. Lastly, both joint physical and legal custody is a combination of the first two.  It is ultimately up to the court to decide whether any type of joint custody is in the best interests of a child. However, you, as a parent, have the right to argue for joint custody if you so wish it.  I am a gay or lesbian parent seeking child visitation rights, are there any special considerations I need to take into account?  There are some states that expressly forbid a judge from considering a parent's sexual orientation when deciding a custody dispute. In these states, the best interests of the child must be considered without giving weight to the sexual orientation of either parent.  However, other states do not have such express laws, and gay and lesbian parents may suffer for it. Judges may impose their own community expectations and biases onto a custody dispute involving gay and lesbian parents., It is often the case that a judge will weigh various factors in favor of a non-gay or non-lesbian parent when considering the best interests of the child.  Do judges or courts even consider race to be a factor in child custody hearings?  Courts are not permitted to consider race as a factor when deciding the best interests of the child.  Who will be the person deciding how much child visitation is fair and reasonable?  In general, the parent with primary custodial rights over a child will get to decide what kind of visitation for the other parent is fair and reasonable. In many situations, this works out well for both parents and they can often come to an amicable arrangement regarding visitation hours and days.  However, what is often in the news and on TV is a result of breakdown in communication between the parents. This usually happens when the parent with full custody of a child decides to be vindictive and uses the child as a weapon. To this end, the parent with custody will set the other parent's visiting rights at a bare minimum, often only for a few hours each week during the most inconvenient times.  Some courts are allowing parents to make custody and visitation plans that the judge will sign into law. Parenting agreements, as they are called, are agreed upon visitation schedules and times where the child will be. These parenting agreements can also include plans that deal with how decisions about the child will be made. For example, the agreement could include language that dictates that the parent with custody at the time of a medical emergency can make a decision about the child's health without consulting the other parent first. Parenting agreements are a great idea and you should look into it more carefully if you want to take full advantage of them.  Is mediation better than a court setting for determining child arrangements and getting custody?  Mediation is a great way to come to terms for a custody agreement instead of child custody lawsuits. The process of mediation works when the two parties, most of the time both parents in child custody situations, agree to sit down with a neutral third-party mediator. The mediator's job is to invoke discussion between the two parties and help them come to some middle ground on which to settle.  There are some great advantages to using mediation over litigation. First and foremost, it is a lot cheaper. Mediation often does not require either side to bring an attorney with, not does it require witnesses or other court time. This can save lots of money on both sides. Second, mediation by itself improves communication between the two disputing parties. By opening an honest discussion, many times problems can be resolve and the child will benefit the most by having both parents thinking along the same lines. Lastly, mediation is much faster than litigation. Litigation can often run for several months of court time, during which the fate of your child's upbringing causes you considerable stress. Mediation, on the other hand, often ends in settlement in as little as ten hours of discussion spread over two weeks.  Your local bar association should be able to point you to a local, experienced family law mediation clinic.  Need Help Getting Custody?

Then, you had better go on reading the article to learn about essential tips concerning joint custody.  Showing your active involvement in your kid’s life  If joint custody is what you want, you should do your best to prove that you actively participate in your child’s daily activities. In this case, no judge will ever want to separate you and your child. To achieve this goal consider documenting whatever you do with your kids, including league games, school events, etc.  In other words, any father who shows a high level of interest in his kid’s life has better chances of getting joint custody.  Proving that you are stable   It is vital for a Dad to show his stability when it comes to child custody. What does this mean? Well, if you are the person who earns more money in a family, it may have a positive impact on your case. However, it isn’t the only way of showing stability. An essential thing is having a stable schedule. In other words, you need to show that your kid will have the opportunity of leading a healthy, as well as full life. For example, one of the components of the stable schedule is coming home for having dinner with your kid. In case you succeed in proving your stability, you may good chances of winning the joint custody.  Having an adaptable and flexible schedule  It goes without saying that active participation in your child’s daily life and stability may help you with the child custody case. In addition to that, you should have a flexible schedule. What if one day your child doesn’t feel well? Is your schedule flexible enough to pick up your kid from school? Do you have the opportunity of taking care of your child in case of emergency situations? Even if you have a full-time job, you still need to show that you are available when your kid needs you.  Knowing proper parenting methods  If you are seeking joint custody, knowing the appropriate parenting methods is important. It’s a good idea to refer to any parenting classes, which you attended.  Respecting your child’s mother  Are you looking for a joint custody, then, you should show respect to your kid’s mother. The court will focus on the way you treat your ex-wife. If you are rude to her, you may have fewer chances of obtaining child custody. Try to demonstrate a positive attitude to your spouse. Even if you don’t get on well, showing hostility to her may only harm you. Thus, conceal your negative feelings and try to stay professional and constructive when it comes to child custody arrangements.  Paying attention to the kid’s education  As a good father, you should focus on your child’s education and show your participation in this process. Do you dedicate your time and efforts to help your kid with a homework and you keep in touch with child’s teachers to become aware of his/her academic performance? Do you actively attend your kid’s school events? Demonstrate the judge and social workers that your kid’s education is crucial for you. Moreover, you have a high level of involvement in it. Make sure that they know about your involvement in his/her education.  You need a reliable support network  You probably realize that you need help to deal with your responsibilities as a parent. Although you have to do most of the work, your task will become easier if they assist you. You should demonstrate that you have a reliable support network.  Making child support payments  If you are a dad who is looking for a joint custody, making child support payments on a regular basis is essential. Do you have an informal agreement with your ex-wife concerning child payments? Then, you had better keep all the necessary records, including check receipts. If you find it difficult to pay the informally agreed upon sum of money with your ex-wife, consider the option of requesting for modification.  Creating a strong relationship with your kid  A good father should always know what’s going on in his kid’s life. You need to be one of the primary members of his/her ‘’world.’’ Your child shouldn’t feel your absence in his/her daily life, so you should show that he/she can always rely on you.  Don’t miss any essential school or social activities  The most effective way of demonstrating your interest and involvement in your kid’s life is attending all the events which are special for him/her. This includes social, educational and religious events, like league games, birthday parties, school events, etc. Especially during such activities children feel over the moon when their both parents are supporting them. Thus, the court will take into consideration your attendance as an evidence of a strong relationship with your kid.  You should have a special space for your kid  The court will also take into account your housing conditions. This means that you need to think about preparing s special space for your child in your home. Even if you live in a small house, the kid should have his/her own space there.  In conclusion, fathers who aim to obtain joint custody need an experienced and knowledgeable attorney’s legal assistance. With a reliable lawyer, you can take a breath with ease, as he/she will fight for rights and help you win the child custody case.

Whether you are a father going for full custody or joint custody , you should be prepared for a difficult child custody battle , especially if the child's mother is also filing for custody. Consider the following tips to help a father get custody. Fathers' Child Custody Tips                                                               01  of 10            Pay Child Support Payments        A father who wants custody of a child should continue to make regular child support payments. If a father has an informal arrangement with the child’s mother, he should maintain records such as check receipts or a written letter from the child’s mother as to the child support arrangements and what's been given thus far. If a father is struggling with child support payments, request a modification , but if a father is able to make the payments, he should ensure he has a good track record of ... MORE making payments.              02  of 10            Build a Strong Relationship        When a child is not in the father’s custody, fathers should call the child frequently and check in on the child’s day.  A father may also stop by the child’s school and introduce himself to the administration. A father should check on a child’s progress often and ensure the child knows that he’s there to offer any assistance necessary.              03  of 10            Maintain Accurate Records        A father should maintain an accurate visitation schedule record to help win child custody. Fathers can capture accurate visitation records by developing and maintaining a parenting plan . A father can submit the parenting plan to the court when child custody is decided.              04  of 10            Attend Important School and Social Gatherings        It’s important for a father who wants custody to attend the child’s social, educational, religious and other important events as evidence of a continuing relationship with the child. Examples of important events are school plays, baptisms, birthday parties and sporting events.  A court will rely on this attendance as evidence of a meaningful relationship.       Continue to 5 of 10 below.                  05  of 10            Prepare a Space For Your Child in Your Home        Even if a father lives in a small space, he should make a special place in his home for the child.  A court will inquire about adequate living accommodations during all hearings for child custody. Fathers should be prepared to respond to the judge’s inquiry regarding housing plans.              06  of 10            Have a Plan        A judge will expect a father to be prepared for child custody, in case child custody is awarded. Fathers should compile intelligent responses to potential questions that are asked by a judge . For example, a judge will ask questions about living accommodations, the child's education including after-school activities and financial preparedness.              07  of 10            Be Respectful        A father who wants custody of a child should remember to always respect the mother of his child. The way a father treats the mother of his child may be a factor in determining child custody. Fathers who are disrespectful or rude to the child's mother will also affect the child, along with the father's chances of obtaining child custody.              08  of 10            Be Honest With Yourself        A father who wants custody of a child should realistically ask himself what he can handle. It's a fact that many fathers may have other responsibilities such as other children or multiple jobs. Multiple responsibilities may affect a father's ability to assume custody of a child, especially full custody.       Continue to 9 of 10 below.                  09  of 10            When In Doubt, Ask Someone Wiser Than You        A father who wants custody of a child should speak to others who have been through the child custody process.  A father who has been through the child custody process can offer insight and let a father who is going through the process know what to expect.              10  of 10            Consider Mediation or Arbitration        A father who wants custody of a child should consider mediation or arbitration , prior to undergoing an adversarial court hearing.  In mediation or arbitration, cases are decided by a neutral third party.  For a father, custody proceedings in a courtroom may be difficult to handle, so he may prefer the smaller, friendlier setting associated with mediation or arbitration.

Joint Custody as a Consideration (Provided by How to Win Child Custody )   Joint custody is a wonderful concept that is difficult to achieve.  It requires two very special parents concerned enough about their children to put their own disputes aside when it comes to the children.  While it requires a major commitment and a great deal lot of work, it is more than worth the effort if you realize even part of its promise. Rather than shooting for the moon, and programming a likely failure to achieve the ideal joint custody, strive instead for the more attainable aspects that most easily fit your established lifestyles.  Begin by loosening up a little when working with each other on your proposed custody plan.  Be cautious with the way you characterize your roles: each of you are undeniably a parent and you are preparing a parenting plan.  Avoid primary/secondary, custodial/noncustodial and custody/visitation distinctions as much as possible.  Don’t lock yourself into a weekend/weekday schedule.  Consider trying something a little different, such as Sunday morning through Wednesday evening with one parent, and the balance of the week with the other.  Your children can in fact have two homes.  You’ve done it! Shared, joint and split custody all refer to variations on a theme in which each parent cares for the children one-third to one-half of the time, although each has its own nuances.  Shared often infers that the non-custodial parent has the children thirty to forty percent of the time, with a primary parent identifiable in the custody plan.  Joint invariably means approximately equal caretaking and equal responsibility for the children, requiring considerable flexibility and especially parents that can work together.  Split usually indicates a fixed schedule, such as three days with one parent and four with the other every week, with nearly equal parental caring and responsibility.  Our discussion will focus on joint custodythe most idealistic and furthest removed from traditional custody plans ordered by the courts. In actual practice, joint custody often requires parents to cooperate more with their spouses after separation than they did during the marriage.  You’ll have to work together to avoid schedule and discipline conflicts.  You must be flexible enough to help the other parent out when needed, because there will be times when you’ll need the help yourself.  You may want to include the rather common provision that you’ll give the other parent the first option to watch the children if you’ll be gone overnight.  On the other hand, you may decide to prefer the use of babysitters when one of you out for just an evening.  Working together, you’ll be far more involved in decisions about school, medical care, and extra activities such as band, sports and dating than you would if just one of you was a primary parent. Build a solid record of involvement with your children from your first day of separation if you even think you might desire joint custody.  Joint custody doesn’t just fall into place; if your spouse won’t agree, you’ll have to go to court.  It’s too late if you really didn’t get to know your own children during the marriage, or learn how to care for them.  Start now, of course, but don’t expect to automatically receive joint custody.  One of the major considerations is parenting skill, and if you don’t have any just yet youre in trouble.  The court is concerned about your children’s best interests, not yours.  The low expectations of many family law courts, based on experience with failed joint custody experiments, is another reason to remain realistic about your chances for joint custodyand to build a factual record to show why it should be given a chance in your case. Case Scenario: Irv wisely never permitted any interruption in the time that he spent with his children.  His efforts paid off with an agreement giving him the children half the time.  He arranged immediately on separation to have his children stay with him at his parents while he looked for a new place to live.  He took his children to preschool before he went to work on mornings that they stayed with him.  He picked them up when he had them again.  When he rented a suitable place to live, the children were still part of his life and moved right in, half time, of course. Don’t forget the economics of joint custody.  Typical mandatory child support schedules assume that the children are with the non-custodial parent twenty percent of the time.  If you have them more than that, no adjustment in child support will be made until, usually, your time exceeds thirty percent.  Do the calculations for your local court schedule; if you are at twenty-eight percent, add a little time to your side and you’ll probably save hundreds of dollars every month. The best way to end up with joint custody is to start with it.  What ifas much as you want joint custodynothing is going right?  Assume for this example that your spouse wants to be the primary parent.  You’ve tried, but can’t reach a compromise.  Your attorney says that you do have a fair chance of getting joint custody.  Act now! Your chances won’t get any better.  Take an aggressive stance.  A court hearing now for temporary custody pending a long-term custody order by settlement or trial will be relatively low key and less expensive than trial.  You have a better chance of getting a joint custody order now, if you have the facts, than later.  Some order must be made at this time because of the parents separation, and up until the time of the hearing the children have been living with you both.  However, the same rule applies to primary custody: what the children have become comfortably accustomed to is likely to be continued. What conditions are favorable for joint custody?  An ideal joint custody situation would require each parent to have a room for their child, with all clothes, toys and other necessary items.  Each of these parents would live in the same school district, and close enough to each other so their child could visit the same friends no matter which home he or she was at.  The two parents would get along so well the child would hardly be aware there had been a divorce.  No one is going to meet this ideal.  Perfect joint custody situations after divorce are rare.  But no one, not the legislature that makes the laws and not the court that interprets the laws, said you had to be perfect. Many situations within your reach are quite suitable for joint custody.  The most important factor is the ability of the parents to work together.  Rooms and toys and clothes and transportation are all secondary to the desire of the parents to make it work.  A parent opposed to joint custody has the power to stifle it because this opposition alone means joint custody won’t work.  However, this same sabotaging parent runs the risk in exercising this power that he or she will be seen to be "less likely to share the child with the other parent" and thus end up being the secondary parent under a traditional plan.  Thus, the parent seeking joint custody just might be rewarded with far more, namely primary custody.

I got a girl who I was just having fun with pregnant. We never really dated or were in any type of committed relationship. At the time she told me I had nothing to worry about and a week later she is pregnant. My mistake there but I can't turn back the hands of time. Me and her didn't really talk during her pregnancy, she wanted me to buy her maternity clothes and wait on her hand and foot, something I had zero interest in. I hired an attorney who is a family friend who attempted to get her to stipulate some type of agreement months prior to the child's birth. The mother ignored these attempts and claimed she was trying to enjoy her pregnancy and didn't need the stress.  As time went on and the birth of the child got closer I  eventually retained this attorney and filed an order. I requested the OC guideline visitation schedule, to pay her child support based off of guideline, get my last name on the birth certificate (it's a boy and she claims she would change it after 1yr of me showing consistency to her) I am asking for 50% split of everything. I also asked for attorney fees (something doesn't sound like I will get) After filing this order she has a family friend who started doing family law recently contact my attorney claiming he is her attorney but hasn't subbed in as the attorney of record on the case. This guy continues to contact my lawyer racking up my attorney fees. The calls lead to nothing, the only offer given so far was all visitation at her house under her supervision for the first year. We are both first time parents, no history of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse on my end. She is 4yrs sober out of the AA program for drinking but never entered a facility.  Really this whole thing has been about her feelings and having a level of control over me. She knows had the child not be involved I would be long gone as I have no interest in even being a friend of hers.  Now the child has been born and I didn't find out until a few days later by looking at her Instagram profile. I was quite enraged and reached out to her stating I felt it was extremely selfish and self-centered she didn't let me know. That same day I left a bunch of gifts for him on her doorstep and she invited me in. For about 3 weeks I have seen him and her almost every day for an average of 5hrs a day (I log all visits) She acts as if we are going to be together, flirting and such. I deflect all of this and make my focus about the baby.  We had a mediation appointment scheduled a few days prior to the child birth (I didn't choose the date, it was assigned) and she no show/no called. Our court date is in 2 days and she asked me to delay it, I told her I didnt want to delay things any longer and wanted to get this done and out of the way. Since then she has pretty much stopped sending me pictures of him or even communicating with me. She says I can see the kid but I have to be around her which she has made extremely uncomfortable. Her attorney is going to go to court on Tuesday and ask to have this delayed, likely act like he is new to the case yet he has been in contact with my attorney for a month. To top it off the guy retires in a few weeks.  What can I do? My attorney has already racked up so much in fees and we havent even been to court yet! I asked her to stop communicating with this guy because it goes no where and just costs me money but she continues to claim she has to. I am just extremely confused (and depressed) here I am wanting to be involved in my son's life yet because I won't be with the mother I am punished. Where as a father do I have a right? It seems so one-sided to me. If we go to court on Tuesday and its delayed I just have to wait? How am I to bond with my newborn son other than kissing her ass? So many cases it seems like the father is a dead beat, in jail, refusing to pay child support and here I am doing the exact opposite and still being treated like I am a POS because I don't want to be with the mother. Any hope or words of wisdom? PLEASE!                          12-14-2014, 09:30 PM    #2         Dogmatique    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Senior Member        Join Date  Apr 2009  Location  Somewhere near Canada  Posts  35,853         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance           Quoting hokeyplayer    My question involves a child custody case from the State of: California  So here is my dilemma and I am not sure of what to do anymore. I got a girl who I was just having fun with pregnant. We never really dated or were in any type of committed relationship.

Me and her didn't really talk during her pregnancy, she wanted me to buy her maternity clothes and wait on her hand and foot, something I had zero interest in.     Congratulations!   You're going to be tied with her for the next.. 18 years or so.       I hired an attorney who is a family friend who attempted to get her to stipulate some type of agreement months prior to the child's birth.    Before paternity was legally established?       The mother ignored these attempts and claimed she was trying to enjoy her pregnancy and didn't need the stress.    No stress is very good for Mom and baby.        As time went on and the birth of the child got closer I  eventually retained this attorney and filed an order. I requested the OC guideline visitation schedule, to pay her child support based off of guideline, get my last name on the birth certificate (it's a boy and she claims she would change it after 1yr of me showing consistency to her) I am asking for 50% split of everything.    By split,   I presume you mean financially?   There is no law requiring Mom to give the child your name.       I also asked for attorney fees (something doesn't sound like I will get) After filing this order she has a family friend who started doing family law recently contact my attorney claiming he is her attorney but hasn't subbed in as the attorney of record on the case.    Attorney fees?   No.       This guy continues to contact my lawyer racking up my attorney fees. The calls lead to nothing, the only offer given so far was all visitation at her house under her supervision for the first year. We are both first time parents, no history of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse on my end. She is 4yrs sober out of the AA program for drinking but never entered a facility.    And your counter-offer was... ?        Really this whole thing has been about her feelings and having a level of control over me. She knows had the child not be involved I would be long gone as I have no interest in even being a friend of hers.    Well,  that sometime happens.    Can't change it now.        Now the child has been born and I didn't find out until a few days later by looking at her Instagram profile. I was quite enraged and reached out to her stating I felt it was extremely selfish and self-centered she didn't let me know.    Given that paternity hasn't been established yet,   you have a bit of a nerve getting upset with her.    Kiddo isn't yours legally until that happens.       That same day I left a bunch of gifts for him on her doorstep and she invited me in. For about 3 weeks I have seen him and her almost every day for an average of 5hrs a day (I log all visits) She acts as if we are going to be together, flirting and such. I deflect all of this and make my focus about the baby.    Very gentlemanly of you.       We had a mediation appointment scheduled a few days prior to the child birth (I didn't choose the date, it was assigned) and she no show/no called. Our court date is in 2 days and she asked me to delay it, I told her I didnt want to delay things any longer and wanted to get this done and out of the way. Since then she has pretty much stopped sending me pictures of him or even communicating with me.    That's entirely up to her.       She says I can see the kid but I have to be around her which she has made extremely uncomfortable.    Be careful.   You might end up paying for a visitation center.       Her attorney is going to go to court on Tuesday and ask to have this delayed, likely act like he is new to the case yet he has been in contact with my attorney for a month. To top it off the guy retires in a few weeks.  What can I do? My attorney has already racked up so much in fees and we havent even been to court yet! I asked her to stop communicating with this guy because it goes no where and just costs me money but she continues to claim she has to. I am just extremely confused (and depressed) here I am wanting to be involved in my son's life yet because I won't be with the mother I am punished. Where as a father do I have a right? It seems so one-sided to me. If we go to court on Tuesday and its delayed I just have to wait?    Pretty much,  yeap.       How am I to bond with my newborn son other than kissing her ass? So many cases it seems like the father is a dead beat, in jail, refusing to pay child support and here I am doing the exact opposite and still being treated like I am a POS because I don't want to be with the mother. Any hope or words of wisdom? PLEASE!    Visitation is commonly at the primary caregiver's abode for at least some time.  Other than that,  I didn't actually see much in the way of a question.  Paternity will be established,   you can file for joint legal custody,   and enjoy your child.   - - - Updated - - -  One more thing.

When she thinks we will be together, she is very nice to me and speaks highly of me. When I make it clear I don't want that she punishes me via the child.

You will have to play catch-up.  You may well have to pay support and suffer through supervised or very limited visitation for a while.  When the child gets older, you may very well be able to have longer visitations, but so long as the child is an infant, chances are your time and access will be somewhat limited.  This is one of the consequences of a frivolous lifestyle, and one that you have to be prepared to accept for engaging in it.  Like it or not, you are tied to mom for the next 18+ years - perhaps all the way through college (assuming he goes to college).  So, settle in, it's gonna be a long and bumpy ride.    ********** Retired Cal Cop Sergeant & Teacher   Seek justice, Love mercy, Walk humbly with your God -- Courageous , by Casting Crowns ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkM-gDcmJeM                      12-14-2014, 10:43 PM    #5         hokeyplayer    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Junior Member        Join Date  Jan 2010  Posts  5         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance    Is this guideline total BS?   http://www.occourts.org/media/pdf/pa...guidelines.pdf  Its all I am asking for                        12-14-2014, 11:05 PM    #6         cdwjava    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Senior Member        Join Date  Sep 2005  Location  California  Posts  19,568         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance    The guidelines are just that: Guidelines.  They do not bind the parents, the court, or the facilitators into any one course of action.  These may be the intended goals, but, a lot depends on the outcomes of meetings with facilitators and the court.    ********** Retired Cal Cop Sergeant & Teacher   Seek justice, Love mercy, Walk humbly with your God -- Courageous , by Casting Crowns ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkM-gDcmJeM                      12-14-2014, 11:21 PM    #7         Dogmatique    View Profile    View Forum Posts    Private Message         Senior Member        Join Date  Apr 2009  Location  Somewhere near Canada  Posts  35,853         Re: As a Father Who Does Not Want to Be with the Mother Do I Stand a Chance           Quoting hokeyplayer    In reply to your questions   Before paternity was legally established?  Yes this was before paternity was established. She claims I am the father why would we need the legal portion done if I am the father to at least start drawing up a plan?     You're putting the cart before the horse - and you NEED that DNA test before you sign a darned thing.    I cannot count the number of single Dads who come here thinking they were the father,  eventually finding that they're not,   and having no recourse to change anything.         No stress is very good for Mom and baby.  I understand this, but I am not the one causing the stress. She is using the child for control, thus causing her own stress by me putting my foot down.    Or seen another way,   you're just one more lousy ex who keeps bugging her for reason.     You have no feet to put down.    She doesn't even need to acknowledge your existence before she's served with a suit and if she's as petty as you're making her out to be,   she's going to present herself as the most perfect New Mommy in OC.         By split, I presume you mean financially? There is no law requiring Mom to give the child your name.  I mean visitation & financially when I mention 50%. I understand there isn't a law for this, but its a boy. I am the only one left to carry on my family name, other than control (requiring "consistency" for a year) why not just put my name now?    You're not going to get a literal 50/50 timeshare.   Joint legal (decision-making) is realistic,  and you'll also  be paying guideline support.   The name issue?   promising you a "maybe"  could well be a simple attempt by Mom to just get you off her back,  in all honesty.         And your counter-offer was... ?  My counter offer was hell no, that’s a joke. I have been to parenting classes and am a first time parent just like her, not sure what gives her a supervisor right to my parenting. My offer is OC guidelines, she came with something completely from left field, offer something a tad bit more reasonable and we can discuss negotiation.    Two things.   First,  you need to understand what those guidelines mean.    They are guidelines - and nothing more.    If one of you is acting like an ass,   the court can very easily snap that parent right back into grade-school and wishing they'd never bothered debating the issue in the first place.  Second,  and you better start getting used to this,   is that she doesn't have to negotiate a darned thing....and if she's feeling as pressured as you're making her feel,  she's going to shut you down.     And don't think for one second that she'll automatically be in the wrong.       Given that paternity hasn't been established yet, you have a bit of a nerve getting upset with her. Kiddo isn't yours legally until that happens.  A bit of nerve? She claims I am the father, what does the court have to do with anything when it comes to seeing your newborn child?    Because it isn't your child until paternity is legally established.   Everything - and I do mean everything - is up to her at this point.         Pretty much, yeap.  You have added to my depression with that response. How is this so one-sided? I just want to be involved in my child's life with minimal interaction with her.    Marriage.    That's honestly the brutal truth.    Without that,   she's in charge at least in the short term.       I don't want to be mean to her, I just don't want to kiss her ass either. My focus is the child that is it. I am a good person, no troubled past, she has told me many times when she thought we would be in a relationship I am going to be a great father. When she thinks we will be together, she is very nice to me and speaks highly of me. When I make it clear I don't want that she punishes me via the child. Does the court pay attention to these things? I know the child is the focus on the court but do they care to see how a mother uses the child for manipulation?    You want the God's honest truth?   You're not really in a bargaining position at the moment.     You are curious,  and excited,  and want to spend as much time as possible with this child.    It's just that you're going about this the wrong way.    You're not in a position of power here - Mom is.   Everything at this point is up to her.  Look,  as Carl is suggesting,   you're already at a disadvantage simply because you weren't married to Mom.    We know she's Mom,  because there are likely 20 people in the delivery room taking video of the joyous event.    But we don't know who Dad is.    If you were married,  you'd automatically be the presumed father and you'd stand equal before the court.  As that's not the case,  yes - you're playing catch-up.    The court won't penalize Mom for not giving in to your offer and while I know you're going to HATE this...if she's savvy (and/or vindictive) enough she can quite literally have some other guy sign the AOP just to make your life that much more difficult.  Is it legal for her to do this?    Absolutely not Is it right?    NO But can she get away with it?   Yes,  unfortunately.    And no matter what you might have in terms of prior agreements,   the court has to sort out who's who and that just takes even longer.  Please take this in the manner intended.    Cool your jets.    Get rid of the belief that you're the one with the negotiating power - because you're not.    If she feels pushed,  or slighted,  or thwarted,   you're setting yourself up for failure even though you're really not doing anything wrong.    The last thing you want is to start this out as a contentious coparenting relationship.     If you're the rational one,   then be rational.    Once things are in place,  you'll be in a much,  much stronger position.  Y'know?

QUESTION  What are the chances of my ex husband getting joint custody of our two children?  Asked on Sep 14th, 2011 on Child Custody - New Jersey      More details to this question:  I am getting a divorce and my husband wants joint custody of our 2 small children.  I do not feel comfortable letting my children spend more time than necessary with him.  He has never changed a diaper, fed them a meal, put them to bed, etc.  He doesn't know what it takes to care for a child.  He does have custody of a child he had out of wedlock five years ago, but I believe he only got custody because we were married and the mother of the five year old couldn't hold down a job and moved around a lot.  Me and the kids are temporarily living with my parents until I can get a job and get our own place.  My soon to be ex husband has a girlfriend already and she has a 3 year old son.  I do not want my kids involved in this mixed-up, confusing situation that my husband has put us in.  I wanted to work this out with him and have tried to get him to go to counseling but he would rather have his girlfriend.  What chance does he have to get joint custody?      Report

It is typically presumed that custody should be joint, so you will need to be prepared to show the judge why he should award primary custody.   An attorney can assist you in preparing evidence and understanding which facts would be important to the judge.         Report

Custody is typically joint, it is the placement schedule that is important. In Wisconsin, many factors are considered. Using mediation as the way to proceed through your divorce, or at least a child specialist to help map out a parenting agreement, is highly recommended.         Report

As for placement, the statutes require maximizing placement with both parents so it is likely that you will end up with a shared placement situation.         Report

The goal of the courts is that each parent have frequent and continuing contact with the children.  Courts will look at which parent is more likely to facilitate a relationship with the other parent when determining custody. If you have concerns about his parenting, you may present those issues to the court. He may be required to take a parenting class. You should probably retain an attorney so that you can present a clear argument to the court.  In the long run, however your ex husband may end up having joint custody of the children if the court deems that it is in their best interests.         Report

Your antiquated comments about "changing   diapers, etc." may be relevant to a point.  However, your question belies   an old stereotype that is being changed in most forward-thinking courts.

Shared parenting is not about the time the children spend with each parent, but about joint decision making.  With shared parenting, you and your husband have to discuss and agree upon the important decisions in your children's lives, such as medical treatment, school placement, extracurricular activities, religious training, and disciplinary measures.  To avoid shared parenting, you would need to show the court that you and your husband cannot make decision together regarding your children, that your husband does not make good decisions for your children, or that there is  history of domestic violence.

He will probably do very well because judges abhor hearing a parent say what you said the way you said it.  It is VITAL that you get a lawyer, who can properly present the same arguments in a way that will improve your chances, rather than how you presented it.         Report

If you are using the term as referring simply to describe whether or not the child will spend any time with the father, it is almost certain that the father will be awarded some amount of "parenting time".  It is very unlikely that a court will deny him any time with the child.  Colorado's system expects that a comprehensive Parenting Plan will be developed and ordered by the court.  If you and the father cannot agree to a suitable Plan, the Court will establish a Plan based on what it considers is best for the child.  As a starting point, the court will presume that what is best for a child is to have two, loving, caring parents involved in parenting.  That means the Plan will have deal with how much time the child will spend in each parent's home, who makes the decisions, and who has what responsibilities.         Report

Posted By The Buncher Law Corporation    When most entertainment media cover the topic of divorce or family law disputes , there seems to almost always be a father figure cast in a negative light.
	 How many movies have you watched that included an abusive dad that couldn’t
	 control his temper? Or, how many television shows have you seen that presented
	 the mother as a caring, protective figure and the dad too strict and authoritarian?
	 While we all understand that these are only character tropes, the effects
	 of this near-constant representation of fathers in the media has trickled
	 into our country’s legal system, making child custody and visitation cases an uphill battle for men, in many cases.  Historically, family law judges have favored women when it comes to awarding
	 child custody. This is due to the prevailing assumption that women are
	 nurturing by nature and men are not. The saying goes, “A mother
	 always knows,” not a father. Even though some states have passed
	 legislation that specifically states family law courts cannot intentionally
	 side with mothers in child custody disputes, these updated changes seem
	 to have done little to the subconscious decision making process of some
	 judges. By some rough estimates, about 60% of cases wherein sole or primary
	 custody is awarded to one parent (as opposed to joint custody to be shared
	 by both) mother is awarded custody, despite the father appearing to be
	 just as eligible, if not more so, to carry that responsibility.  If the odds seem unfairly stacked against fathers due to society’s
	 predispositions and centuries of common practice, how can a dad fight
	 for his right to sole or primary child custody, and win ?  What Fathers Can Do to Win Child Custody  Put aside possible biases against fathers in divorce and you will find
	 that all family law courts, no matter what state you are in, are supposed
	 to rule in favor of “the child’s best interests.” A
	 child’s best interests boil down to which parent will most likely
	 be able to provide a stable home and loving lifestyle for the child, which
	 in turn will encourage positive development. A parent’s sex or gender is not included in the language of these laws. This is where a father will need
	 to focus his efforts in the dispute: proving he can provide what is best
	 for his child or children.  To establish that you, the father of your child, deserve sole or primary
		 child custody, you should start by thinking of three things:    How your child sees you: The biggest help to your argument for sole or primary child custody is
		 your child himself or herself. Children will tend to prefer the parent
		 that has given them the most attention, even if this is not stated openly.
		 If you were the one who picks up your kids from school, takes them to
		 the doctor, and reads them bedtime stories, your child is going to miss
		 that routine and sense of normalcy should it disappear after your divorce.
		 In order to avoid damaging that comfort zone, a court will likely reward
		 sole or primary custody to you.   Your relationship with your wife: Along the same vein of keeping the status quo of your child’s day-to-day
		 life undisturbed, family law courts prefer, if possible, that a child
		 still see both parents frequently. If you have maintained a civil relationship
		 with your wife despite the divorce process unfolding, it looks good. In
		 fact, if you have been careful to not overstep your boundaries or onto
		 your wife’s toes, you in particular look good in the eyes of the court, as it wants a child
		 to grow up under the care of someone who is level headed.   Future relationships and situations: The court will look beyond the here and the now when rewarding child custody.
		 If you plan on living with some friends while looking for a place of your
		 own, the personalities of those new people and your overall living situation
		 must be considered as well. Are you interested in pursuing new partners
		 after the divorce? The court may not appreciate that venture as much as
		 you do. In essence, any behavior that could be seen as that of a “bachelor”
		 is not the same as that of a father & it can hurt your odds of getting
		 sole or primary child custody.   Considerations Dealing with More Concrete Information  With the three “abstract” considerations considered, it is
	 time to actually look at concrete evidence and numbers to improve your
	 chances of getting full custody as a father. What do you have at your
	 disposal and that is on paper that can help your argument? Sometimes a
	 properly sorted portfolio is the difference between raising your kids
	 every day and wondering when you will see them next.  Information and data you can use to sway the court’s decision in
		 your favor include:   Your regular income – you can afford to raise a child.  Your regular (and flexible) work schedule – you have the time to
		 raise a child.  Your clean criminal record – you have the right temperament to raise a child.  Your medical history – you have the health needed to raise a child.   If all of these look good on your end but not so much on your wife’s
	 end, get copies of her information, too. A side-by-side comparison of
	 objective information can be powerful in proving you are prepared to continue
	 being a father, and that your soon-to-be ex-wife needs to spend more time
	 focusing on herself.  Hold Onto Your Family Home If You Can  Finally, you must realize the importance of staying in your family home
	 as the divorce unfolds. You should never automatically concede and move
	 out unless staying poses a risk to your health, such as in incidents of domestic violence . If you pack up and leave the moment a divorce is announced, leaving your
	 kids to stay with your wife in your home, you have just created the new
	 normal for your children, which is living with their mother and not their
	 father. A judge will, once again, not want to upset a child any further
	 and will lean towards awarding child custody to whomever stayed in the
	 family home, out of simplicity’s sake. Should you be given a temporary
	 court order to vacate your marital home, you should start thinking immediately
	 as to how you can reverse it.  Irvine Divorce Lawyers Standing Up for Fathers’ Rights  Our team of family law attorneys in Irvine believe that the law should not be tilted
