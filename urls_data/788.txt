    - 9 years, 5 months ago Yes it is possible to have your account hacked. It's happened to me. I logged into Xbox.com and I couldn't sign in. Whoever did it changed all of my account info and stuff. Microsoft was very helpful when I gave them a call to see what was going on, they had everything fixed in about 45 minutes. I suggest that if you can't log on to anything give Microsoft a call. Or the guy could just be fooling with you. Whatever the case may be....watch out!!!!

Maybe he is just messing around, but I dont know. thegamesnake20 No one's gonna hack your account, it just aint gonna happen. The reason I say that is because you need more than a gamertag in order to hack or (fake hack) an account. The way most people hack peoples Xbox Live account is due to YOU giving out your own info because you think someones gonna give you Microsoft Points or achievements etc. it's more of a phishing scheme than an actual hack. So don't be worried about scums on Xbox Live saying they're gonna hack you, cuz it's not gonna happen unless you give your own info out without thinking.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago I already posted a thread the other day about this, but I would like to bring something up. When my account was hacked the hacker downloaded Portal and a few other arcade games. I go to look at the games and it asks me to "Download Again" So do I get them for free now? I canceled my credit card and they said they would be doing an investigation. Should I wait until after the investigation to download them? So they don't think I downloaded them and am blaming a hacker. And last of all I have never given out any information concerning gamertags, emails, passwords, etc. Carnifex726 Member Since: December 1, 2008 Posts: 407 Carnifex726 Follow Forum Posts: 407 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #2 Posted by Carnifex726 (407 posts)

    - 8 years, 7 months ago Considering your gamertag shows your last game played was portal I guess this thread is kinda irrelevant - you clearly downloaded and started playing it!    Basically once it is on your account the chances of getting a refund from MS are slim to none, so take some solace in the fact the "hacker" bought a decent game with your money.    In future don't enter your account details into any website, no matter how tempting the "offer" is for free MS points, free Live, free game, or anything else.  So called "hackers" don't just magically find your account details - the vast majority are phishing scams where the user willing enters their details into a site. bobdood99 Member Since: November 3, 2007 Posts: 1862 bobdood99 Follow Forum Posts: 1862 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #8 Posted by bobdood99 (1862 posts)
    - 8 years, 7 months ago Did you get your  "phr33" mircrosoft points? FrostyGopher Well the guy left 230 MS points on my account and I think he's done screwing around with it, because i canceled my card and switched passwords and emails. bobdood99 Member Since: November 3, 2007 Posts: 1862 bobdood99 Follow Forum Posts: 1862 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #9 Posted by bobdood99 (1862 posts)

Avenger1324 Well in the first place I don't have Portal on my HDD. He played it on my account so therefore that is why it is on my gamertag.. And Second of all I never put my information on any site. I'm not stupid. I can spot a scam anywhere. So apparently you're irrelevant. jakethesnake159 Member Since: June 19, 2009 Posts: 6284 jakethesnake159 Follow Forum Posts: 6284 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 43 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #10 Posted by jakethesnake159 (6284 posts)

    - 8 years, 7 months ago I think people should stop referring to this type of situation as "My account was hacked." Your account wasn't "hacked". It was accessed by someone because you gave them your login details.    When you say hacked it sounds like someone broke into the Microsoft database and got your info from the Xbox Live server. People reading this might think it could happen to them because Microsoft isn't protecting their information properly. Your account wasn't "hacked" so you shouldn't say it was.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago Man It seems like everyones account is getting hacked. Be safe, don't download anything off the marketplace until the investigation is over. Carnifex726 I've been threatened over 300 times with the line "I'm gonna hack your account"... LITERALLY!! And you know how many times I've been hacked? Zero times. The way people's accounts are getting hacked is due to their own stupidity...don't give your info out to fake websites that say you'll get free Microsoft points, free map packs, in game cheats because there all fake. Also, going to the wrong website that you think is authentic is another big account stealer. Avoid all of the above and you won't have to worry about forfeiting your account. So there's no such thing as your account getting hacked! bobdood99 Member Since: November 3, 2007 Posts: 1862 bobdood99 Follow Forum Posts: 1862 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #17 Posted by bobdood99 (1862 posts)

The only other way I can think of is the perpetrator calling Microsoft's customer service and pretending to be you, but they'd still have to have an significant amount of info to get far.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago Look, hacks can actually happen even if the guy doesn't go "my PW is..." Things that can happen: 1: Bad link in email puts keylogger on comp 2: Msn friend sends u a virus through their own virus 3: Xboxes can be modded to a computer to show the IP address of other players. Next step: send virus to that player's email 4: Advert, website, etc, when clicked on, can send you a virus. (even innocent looking things) My friend has been hacked before without giving any info out (honestly, not all of us are that stupid) and one of the four or more above things could have happened. Either that or your password recovery questions were easily guessable, the account was recovered, etc? (If you recover an acc, you can mod the xbox to your comp to make it guess the password... Nasty. I won't say how or reveal any hints in any shape or form but I know it CAN happen.) But anyway, to answer the topic question: If the game says "download again" it means the game is already on your profile and paid fore. It is free to download a second time. However, I would wait about a week before doing this to let the investigation finish.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago There are more and more stories like this and it really bothers me. I thought XBL was secure, now I'm getting paranoid.:( getyeryayasout NOTHING online is secure. BUT I have a hard time believing our accounts can get hacked. Anyways, dont matter to me as I have conceled my LIVE and canceled my card information as well.

    - 9 years, 5 months ago i dont think it would be possible. im not sure exactly how microsoft has the xbox live accounts setup, but who would honestly go through the effort to figure it out and actually hack your account and probably extremely risking getting banned forever by microsoft or something like that. unless hes just sitting at he xbox 360 and trying different passwords for your account.

    - 9 years, 5 months ago Having your IP address means nothing, since it has no direct link to your gamertag. With my old modem it obtained a new IP every time it connected, and with my current one it keeps the same one until I request a new one. It's easy to find out someone's IP and several forum users have a tool in their sig which shows your IP.

    - 9 years, 5 months ago actually yes he can. I know a guy that does it, he has a program that tells you the address of where the IP is coming from and name and stuff like that, internet provider, and then they can all microsoft and say they dont remember some information but they have enough to get it and they steal you account that way. oneofthefall Member Since: July 31, 2008 Posts: 494 oneofthefall Follow Forum Posts: 494 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 6 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #7 Posted by oneofthefall (494 posts)

    - 9 years, 5 months ago I'm sorry but it is quite possible... This is not hacking per say but it serve the same deed. It's called Denial of service (DoS) and it consist of using the user IP to send lots of info and fool the servers into believing that YOUR IP is spaming everyone. Your Provider will then block your account for 1 week or so. Another way it can work is the other way around, Saturate your IP with packets sent until your IP/Computer reset or gets unsufficient resosurce to act (or very slowly). Since you won't be able to use the Internet, you will then believe that you've been hacked. It will come back but you be classified as a "spamer". It's an old technique that always work. No way to trace the guy who did it since this technique uses "dedicated" servers all around the world. Simple, efficient. iam2green Member Since: August 1, 2007 Posts: 13991 iam2green Follow Forum Posts: 13991 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #14 Posted by iam2green (13991 posts)

TLOM It is possible, but not without a TON of work.  And even if he hacked your account, do you really think he is going to fly/drive/walk from wherever he lives to where you live because of a video game?  People that get that angry about games are generally losers who have nothing more important in their lives to be frustrated about, so I wouldn't worry about it.  I have heard stories of people reporting stuff like that to the police (who CAN and DO get into Xbox Live accounts when necessary) and the threatening person being arrested.  After all, it's really no different than me standing face to face with you and saying I am going to find and hurt you.  So if you are worried, call the cops.  Now THAT would teach your friend not to be such a D bag on LIVE lmao.

    - 9 years, 11 months ago People can't just magically "hack" your account information. The people who had their accounts stolen, had them stolen in the usual way... they gave out their information somewhere, like on a website or in an email, their friends knew their info and passed it on to other people, they had a keylogger on their computer, or someone managed to get the password to their email because their password was too short or obvious. If someone does get your account somehow, they cannot steal your credit card info as that is not displayed, they can only buy MS points, and I believe you can cancel the transaction by talking to your credit card company. zaokamura Member Since: January 21, 2004 Posts: 1719 zaokamura Follow Forum Posts: 1719 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #6 Posted by zaokamura (1719 posts)

    - 9 years, 11 months ago Yes... Xbox Live is safe for credit cards... some people are just scared (understandably) giving their information to anyone, including Microsoft. Kind of ironic if they still use them at stores, but whatever. Using your credit card on XBL is no different then using it at a Walmart or on Amazon.com.

    - 9 years, 11 months ago You almost certainly have fraud protection with your credit card company and anyone who thinks they're cool enough to hack MS let them. I've been running a credit card membership since launch. No problems. Plus whenever you suddenly need MSPOINTS you can order them instantly and buy whatever expansion/arcade game you need. You dont have to run out to a store to buy a card. XBOX live will renew automatically every year so you won't have worry about that either. msjr78 Member Since: October 19, 2005 Posts: 4004 msjr78 Follow Forum Posts: 4004 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #11 Posted by msjr78 (4004 posts)

    - 9 years, 7 months ago My brother tried to sign in to his account and it gave him the error message that you receive when your account has been recovered on someone else's 360.  It wouldn't let him recover it.  I looked at my friend's list for his gamerpicture and it was under another name.  He tried that gamertag along with the email and password, and he recovered it just fine.  The only problem is that the guy who took his account used 800 of his microsoft points to change the gamertag (I assume so my brother couldn't find it).  He doesn't want to file an official complaint, but I sure as hell do.  I don't want my account hacked - this crap needs to be reported.  I have called 1-800-4MY-XBOX enough times to know that if I call them about this, they will have no idea what to do (I can't even understand them anyways).  Here's the bottom line: does anyone know how to officially report hacking to microsoft?  I don't want this guy to end up stealing my account and beautiful gamerscore.

    - 9 years, 7 months ago So your brother got his gamertag back? If so, tell him to change his WINDOWS ID password to something completely different then what it was before. So it can't be stolen again. As for reporting a person who took the gamertag, I dunno if anything can be done.

    - 9 years, 7 months ago By the sounds of it your brother gave out his e-mail and password to a site that wasn't xbox.com or some other source that got his account stollen. However that doesn't seem to be the case cause phising scams will then change the e-mail and password to something else so you cannot re access the account. It sounds to me like your brother gave his account to a friend or something who then just decided to be an idiot and change it. Or you or your brother are not giving us the full story. Basically all you can do is change the password to the e-mail address and suck it up, a report isn't going to do anything, you can do the same as well and try to be more careful with who you give your personal information next time....

Odds are your brother gave him the password because the perpetrator probably told him he can give him free points or easy achievements. So in Microsoft's eyes that's negligent and stupidity. So you need to talk to your brother and ask him who he gave the password to. There's no way for someone to hack your account. And I know there's some hype person gonna come in here and say other wise. Anyways, tell him in the future not to give his password to random people on Live that say they can do things for him, cuz it's lies. p00phead Member Since: May 15, 2007 Posts: 1203 p00phead Follow Forum Posts: 1203 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 2 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #18 Posted by p00phead (1203 posts)

    - 9 years, 3 months ago I remember reading about this last year. What these people do is keep calling Microsoft a lot with the gamertag they want, claiming to have just forgotten the password, requesting it to be reset. Now protocol is for Microsoft to ask your name, address and answer your secret question but there are a few idiots at Microsoft that don't follow that procedure and do it anyway. These people know the best times of days to do this (my guess first thing in morning, last thing at night and busy times) and do it to steal your gamer score, ms points and worst, your identity in the real world as they can obtain your name, address, D.O.B. etc. Microsoft are aware of this and yet have no official comment as it is their own staff being negligent Now before people start saying that I am to bash the 360, I am a 360 patriot, launch console and all:DI just remember this on gamespot last yea r chaoscougar1 Member Since: April 7, 2005 Posts: 37597 chaoscougar1 Follow Forum Posts: 37597 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 13 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #26 Posted by chaoscougar1 (37597 posts)

The Xbox 360&apos;s FIFA Phishing Continues Unabated Since October, we&apos;ve heard anecdotal accounts of Xbox Live members finding suspicious… Read more Read Advertisement At first believed to be the result of hacks in relation to EA's FIFA series , it's now looking more likely to be the result of a widespread scam run by shady types out to either make money or score cheap games. FIFA -Loving Hackers Strike Xbox Live Accounts Xbox Live users should keep an eye on their accounts, and any credit card associated with that… Read more Read One of the more high profile victims of these "jackings" (not "hacks," we'll get to that in a minute) was Susan Taylor, who wrote an account of her experiences, and which we covered back in January . Having stood up and identified herself as an unhappy victim, Susan soon got something she was probably never expecting: members of the jacking community reaching out to her. Advertisement Is the Xbox Live "Hacking" Problem Worse Than Microsoft Realises? So late last year, people began to complain that their Xbox Live accounts were being… Read more Read UPDATE - See bottom of post for update from Microsoft. Three such types contacted Susan and tipped her off to sites and forums where jackers congregate and trade. They were also, as members, able to access the sites (most are obviously restricted from public viewing) and pass along some of the information contained within, including techniques on how to obtain someone else's Xbox Live account information. Advertisement You can see one such site, which is publicly accessible, here . On its "black market" forum, you'll see members both selling stolen Xbox Live accounts and making requests, one person looking for an account with good Modern Warfare 3 stats, another selling an account with the presumably desirable name of "One V One". The key distinction between "jacking" and "hacking" is that these guys aren't forcefully circumventing any software protection measures. What they're doing is, in a nutshell, contacting Microsoft, pretending to be the legitimate account holder, and through poor security and a whole lot of bluffing (usually making excuses as to why information was incorrect or why passwords could not be remembered), getting hold of the necessary reference numbers and information they need to then go on and access a stranger's Xbox Live account. Here's an excerpt Susan was able to obtain, outlining one such strategy: PERSON A 1. First you go to Xbox.com and click support at the top left of the website. 2. Then go to the bottom of the page and click Contact Us. 3. Once on that page click the Email Us link. Then click Xbox Live. 4. Now this is where it gets SERIOUS. For the name put a name. I personally use an actual agent's name ([Name redacted by Kotaku]) then put there employee ID which I put a fake ID. For the reason put Technical Support. Then for the email put XXXX@microsoft.com or something to do with the agent's name but Microsoft. For the reason put something like this "Customer (put there name if you have it on the account you want) verified the 16 Credit Card digit number. He has made an inquiry about how he has forgotten his accounts information, since I am a Tier 1 agent I am unable to view the customers GT. He has requested to have the answer changed to (put some realistic for the answer). The Xbox Live Gamertag is (put GT). – [Name redacted by Kotaku]" (IMAGE) 5. Now you should see something like this (IMAGE) 6. Call up Xbox 30 minutes later. After they answer say that you were disconnected from a Tier 2 agent and ask to be transferred back. 7. After they transfer you to the Tier 2 agent give them the number (remember your the customer so you have to act like you have pretty much no idea what's on it). Once they pull it up they will take a little while and change it. DO NOT ASK FOR THE EMAIL so that you can know where to reset it. 8. Then call back and say you forgot your email but know your Secret question answer. They will ask for the GT and answer tell them and they will give you the email. Congrats now you get the OG. This wont work every time so don't get discouraged. Advertisement That sounds depressingly simple. Here's another one. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PHISHING clearly as you know all too well but MS tries to hide this very well. This is called by the hackers ad "Jacking an account" and what i talk about below is probably not even entered your head as how your account was taken. The main thing is that reference number you get, see how they helped you with just a reference number and no other proof you were who you said??? Basically they ring other small companies associated with MS after getting a reference number associated with your gamertag/zune account. To get the reference number they ring either xbox or zune support and when asked about security info such as name they give fake info and then say "Oh if thats not right my brother must have changed it, hes not in so can i have a reference number to call you back when he is home?" These smaller companies release your name and more and literally all i or the hacker would have to say after giving them the reference number is "Could you help me verify the information on my account please". Being a smaller, clueless company they give info out like your name or address. They then call back repeatedly getting different info (this is a lengthy process as not every agent is stupid but these people spend days/weeks targetting accounts) Bear if mind they will get your email address from this process and that pretty much seals the accounts fate into being hacked. Most people use the same email and their real/same info for everything so if they see on xbox.com you have netflix or something similar like that they will call netflix and they have all the right name and address ect. So one example of something i would do and what these people do is to say to netflix "I purchased a new subscription but its not showing up can you check you have the right payment option on file" because the hacker can give all the correct info to netflix or whoever elses service it is and they will cluelessly give out the last 4 digits of the Credit Card. Now with the last 4 digits of a credit card a password reset form is almost certain to be successful when the hackers submits one through the windows live page when you click forgot password. But there are also hotlines were agents will reset the password over the phone when the hacker provides all this info because they are bound to believe someone with the last four of a CC right? so they help the hacker get your account. There are literally TONS of different little tactics here and there that these people or I used to use to get different bits of infomation and i only skim over it briefly above obviously because it would be too lengthy to try and explain it with written words in one email. Advertisement As you can see, if this stuff is indeed the kind of methodology used by jackers, it's a far more serious problem than a flaw in Xbox Live's code or immediate security. That sort of thing can be patched, the holes plugged. What Susan's sources are describing though, that's something else. That's a failure of bureaucracy. Something broken at a systemic and fundamental level of Microsoft's customer service system, a result of under-trained and outsourced staff not knowing the finer details of the service's security framework. Which is a lot harder, and slower to fix. It would also explain why it's been so hard for Microsoft to track down the problem. It's been looking for a problem , something obvious, a chink in Xbox Live's armour. What's being described here, acts of deception carried out on a personal level with customer service staff, wouldn't even come up on their radar. Advertisement BUT WHY? The raft of thefts reveal that Xbox Live accounts are big business. Definitely worth the trouble of getting hold of. But why? It appears there's a market for all kinds of accounts and the things related to them. The most obvious, and lucrative for the more criminally-minded, are accounts with credit card or PayPal info linked to them. Once loaded up with "free" Microsoft Points, they're then sold off to buyers who get thousands of points for a lot less than they'd normally have paid for them. Another money-saving motivation is free games. If an account has purchased any Games on Demand titles, for example, those games are linked to the account, meaning the new owner can jump onto Xbox Live and download the games "again" for free. Surprise surprise, the most valuable accounts are ones with Call of Duty titles attached. Advertisement Two other reasons, though, are a little more vain. Some black market buyers want access to "OG" usernames. They don't want, for example, "b08". They want "Bob", or names related to pop culture figures, or movie stars, or dumb shit like "Killer". The more interesting OG handles are thus targets for jackers, and can be sold for hundreds of dollars. The other cosmetic lure is a user's tenure. In the corner of your Xbox Live avatar there's a number. The higher the number, the longer you've been a member. Long-time members—we're talking 5-6+ years—are of course the most valuable, and are a target for jackers who can sell them to people who want to look more seasoned on Xbox Live than they actually are. Advertisement PREVENTION If these reports are accurate, then what can you do to protect your account? It would appear you can't do anything at all. Unlike a phishing scam, which you can head off by changing passwords, these jackers are bypassing the user entirely and going straight to Microsoft support. If they see a gamertag they think can make them money, then they'll pull their support scam, and if they can pull it off (as stated above, often they're unsuccessful) there's not a thing you'd be able to do about it. About the only recommendations would be to do what you should be doing anyway: keep your passwords separate, don't link credit card information to an account and use a dedicated email account for just your Xbox Live, nothing else. At least then you're minimising the damage, cutting down on the possibilities that by stealing your account details these scammers also get access to other online services of yours. Advertisement Bear in mind that while these reports may seem convincing, given their origin and the fact nobody but Microsoft knows the full extent of how its own support network operates, the means of account "jacking" should be treated as rumour until we're able to confirm them. As such, we've contacted Microsoft, and will update if we hear back. UPDATE Asked for comment, Microsoft has responded to Kotaku with the following: There are several different methods malicious users employ to gain unauthorized access to accounts; social engineering is one of them. We are aware of the vulnerabilities that social engineering poses, and continue to address these through tools and training to help keep our members safe and secure. The security of Xbox LIVE member accounts is a top priority and we continue to take aggressive steps to protect our members against ever-changing threats. This includes continually evolving our security practices and staff training to help prevent these scenarios from occurring. Advertisement On the specific examples highlighted: We really appreciate that these issues have been raised; however, the specific examples in this article contain information that is invalid and out-of-date. We would welcome the opportunity to work directly with Ms. Taylor and the members who have contacted her with unresolved cases. We have done a considerable amount of work to resolve cases for our customers in the last several months and will be reaching out to her to provide further assistance. And finally, advice from Microsoft on protecting your account: Engaging in identity theft, trading in stolen accounts and committing credit card fraud is all illegal, and those involved in this activity risk criminal prosecution. The activity also violates our Terms of Use, and we are actively stepping up account and console bans for both sellers and buyers of known stolen accounts and content. Finally, many of our security enhancements and recovery processes, should an account become stolen , are dependent upon our members being able to verify their identities using additional proofs, such as secondary email addresses, phone numbers, security questions and answers, or trusted devices. Adding strong identity proofs to an account provides multiple layers of identity verification, which can drastically reduce the incidence of identity theft and other online fraud.

Create an account [–] Xer0daze  30 points 31 points 32 points  5 years ago *  (3 children) Microsoft employee here - I can confirm that "hacks" (or more specifically - account hijacking) tend to occur via password resets primarily. Make sure your email attached to you xbox live ID has a complex password and it's usually a good thing to go ahead and make your live email password different than any other passwords you use. In other words - make sure your password isn't 'password' or something easy like that. Another good thing to do is periodic password resets on your linked email account. ALWAYS report any suspicious activity to xbox live policy enforcement or call support directly at 1-800-4-my-xbox if you run into trouble.   permalink embed save give gold [–] calmdrive  6 points 7 points 8 points  5 years ago  (0 children) Not only this, but use the proofs that are available. A second e-mail address and phone number. You can choose to have a e-mail or text sent to you if your account is logged into a new device.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] bleu213  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 years ago  (0 children) I'll confirm most of this. One nitpick is that support over the phone doesn't have that many options for reporting suspicious activities. In fact, we have absolutely nothing we can do for this. We can however help people once one needs an unauthorized claim, or if they need help modifying and securing their information. We'd be happy to. :D   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago  (0 children) My Microsoft account is linked to everything now.

Generally, what happens is a phishing scam. You get a message from "Xbox" or someone claiming to have some sort of authority asking for your login info, people will without really thinking about it provide quite a bit of information about themselves without much provocation.  Legitimate hacking is trying to find a backdoor using software.   permalink embed save give gold [–] iheartbakon  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (1 child) There are other attack vectors.  You could visit a dodgy gaming site that installs a keylogger on your pc via a browser exploit and whenever you log into your LIVE account, your credentials could be captured and sent to a hacker. In theory anyway.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] NerdHavoc  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago  (0 children) Key loggers aren't as effective as they used to be because they're easily identified by most antivirus programs. If you're completely unprotected yeah you could be compromised but key loggers are fairly rare now.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] MarcFirewing  11 points 12 points 13 points  5 years ago  (0 children) Word is, it's from people knowing your email and finding a way to reset your password via customer service. That's one of the methods, anything beyond that is giving your account in exchange for getting gamerscore, DLC, etc. If there are any other ways then I'm not one to know about them, you can't really stop the first one other than to keep your account as secure as possible by not giving out your email to potential "hackers" (and I use this term lightly) and to beef up the account security.  All in all though, if they're determined, I highly doubt any of that will stop them. It's just a matter of being careful.   permalink embed save give gold [–] babycheeses  5 points 6 points 7 points  5 years ago  (0 children) Your Xbox account is NEVER 'hacked".  That implies the Xbox LIVE itself is comprimised; it has never been.  Ever.  What can happen: you use an untrusted machine -- say a friend's -- who's runnig a keylogger. Your own PC is breached and a keylogger betrays you.  Perhaps someone has you give them the password under false pretense ("Ill give you 1k MSP if you enter this contest!1!") or other nonsense.  Nevergive your password out.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  5 years ago  (1 child) [deleted]   [–] SaddestClown  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) Usually it's from "loaning" your account to someone that says they need the login to give you something special or from simply having an easy to guess password on your account.   permalink embed save give gold [–] BadVogonPoet  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (3 children) Here's an article from xbox.com regarding how to create security proofs. It's a great way to increase the protection on your account: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/security-proofs  As others in this thread have stated, XBL accounts don't get hacked. They are accessed via social engineering, commonly referred to as phishing.  This is why it's important to maintain your anonymity online, even when it comes to stuff you might think is harmless like where you go to school or what your dog's name is. For example, if a stranger knows your real first name and the town you live in; he or she might be able to search for you on Facebook and learn enough information about you to answer the security measures that protect your account.  It's important to make sure all your activity online is done with a nod to your own privacy. It's way too easy for people to use social media to learn all sorts of information about you.  Here's another article with information about managing your Microsoft account: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account   permalink embed save give gold [–] majornelson majornelson  12 points 13 points 14 points  5 years ago  (2 children) Also, be sure to add Proofs to your account >> http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/security-proofs    permalink embed save parent give gold [–] smacksaw  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (1 child) Hmm.

I suggest doing it.   permalink embed save [–] BJUmholtz BJUmholtz  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (4 children) Everything I've read is wrong.  It's social engineering. 1) Make friends with a guy online, chat him up, and find out interests. 2) Use this knowledge to attempt to break into an alternate email attached to the Microsoft Account. This is often accomplished by tricking Support into revealing the alternate email. 3) Send password reset emails for MS account to alternate email after breaking into it. 4) You will now see FIFA EA Tokens galore on your purchase history since they can be laundered through the game into a bank account (they could be in FIFA 12).  Stop it by: 1) Not talking on XBOX Live. 2) Using crazy password combos including characters like %&#. 3) Setting your secret question to something odd... Favorite food? stainless steel. First car? David Carr. Childhood friend? Pee Tear Griffin. 4) Don't save passwords on alternate XBOXs. 5) Link Paypal instead of CCs. 6) Call XBOX Support ASAP... if your account is migrated overseas, NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO SAVE IT OR YOUR GUITAR HERO SONGS 7) Report all suspicious activity through the Player Review system. Support will direct you to do this if you call and nothing has happened yet. 8) Keep a record of your Console ID & Console Serial in a private place in case your console is physically stolen. (settings/System/Console Settings/System Info) 9) Anyone who says they can get you Prestige or MS Points for free or for fee is LYING. 10) Even on LIVE, an MS employee will never ask for your personal info. It will only be asked by support when YOU initiate a support call. 11) CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD OFTEN 12) CANADIANS STOP USING 'CANADA' AS YOUR FUCKING PASSWORD 13) Change all your email and all account passwords IMMEDIATELY 14) You may also use the support callback system to securely login from a computer for service so you are preloaded on callback... no further personal verification necessary.

He's there to sell you software that'll let you launch a DDOS attack from your Xbox 360. SHARE TWEET Call of Duty fan karter0, excited that Black Ops 2 was now backwards compatible on Xbox One, booted up the game. They quickly found themselves in a compromised lobby, where a hacker had taken control and folks ran around at lightning speeds. Before karter0 left the game, worried it might flag his account for suspicious activity, he took note of the host's gamertag. When karter0 looked them up on Twitter, they found someone charging $5 for "recoveries," a common hacker term for a service to alter a player's stats, in Black Ops 2 .  For the purposes of this story, we'll call this hacker Andy. He asked to remain anonymous, and as such, I've masked both his personal identity and the software and services he develops for Xbox 360.  Why was this a problem at all? Well, when Black Ops 2 became backwards compatible, Microsoft neglected to mention that everyone playing Black Ops 2 would be forced to do so on Xbox 360 servers. This meant joining an abandoned playground largely been taken up by hackers in the years since Xbox One launched, as Microsoft turned their security attention towards its current console. Call of Duty images courtesy of Activision Blizzard. "Yeah, they've been ignoring it since Xbox One came out pretty much," said a hacker who goes by the name enMTW. "It's not hard to detect these kind of services, but Microsoft doesn't seem interested in doing anything about it. They used to ban this kind of stuff constantly. These services were incredibly expensive. Now anyone can get online and cheat like mad."  When contacted, Microsoft urged the community to help them track hackers.  "We put gamers at the center of everything we do," said a Microsoft spokesperson, "and we'll continue to investigate reports from the community to help ensure that gamers on Xbox Live adhere to our Code of Conduct ."  Activision did not respond to my request for comment.  If you've played a Call of Duty game online before, chances are you've encountered a lobby like this, often indistinguishable from a normal one. Someone with a hacked console has an enormous amount of control and subversion tools. On the surface, it seemed like this Andy was luring folks into seemingly normal Black Ops 2 lobbies, screwing with their accounts, and charging $5 to fix it.  Andy, who I talked to recently over Skype, denies that Twitter account is his—"I don't fuck with people's accounts"—but freely admitted to operating compromised Black Ops 2 lobbies where he messes around with people. He didn't build the tool that compromises Black Ops 2 , but it certainly gives him a lot of power. He can freeze a player's Xbox 360, kick them from the game, and even snoop around to discover their IP address, which can easily be used to learn where they live. (IPs can't be used to pinpoint a specific location, more of a general vicinity.) It's not hard to look up the IPs of players who are playing game with the right tools. Image courtesy of Andy. Typically, though, what Andy does is flip on infinite ammo and other hacks to get people's attention, before he advertises his Instagram feed. Why Instagram? That's where Andy's side business lives, the place where he advertises his customized Xbox 360 software.  Calling it software is somewhat misleading. What Andy has built is called a stealth server, a service that allows you to slip a modded console onto Xbox Live, and when you connect, you get access to custom features specific to his software. These range from the simple—UI color customization, adding a welcome message when you login—to the ethically dubious, such as the ability to launch a DDOS attack from your Xbox 360. To someone who's used an Xbox 360 before, it simply looks like a modified version of the interface that Microsoft had used for years, and when used in combination with other tools, like the Black Ops 2 one referenced above, it gives the user a lot of leeway to begin messing with the experiences of other people online.  Andy's custom software looks a lot like an Xbox 360 interface. These services often allow you to execute certain features directly from an Xbox 360, while often allowing for a direct connection to a nearby PC, which can also interact with the console.  21-year-old Andy began futzing around with consoles when he was 16.  "I've always been kind of techy," he said, "so I figured, 'Well, I'll start modifying consoles for my friends.'"  The primary reason his friends wanted modified consoles isn't surprising: piracy.  "I don't condone that, of course," he said. "I … [pause] I don't. [pause] That's the main reason why people want modified consoles."  Around this time, Andy, who comes from a military family, joined the army. He put modifying on hold, partially because of the job and partially because he was tired of the clientele, which often included confused parents buying a modified console for their kids. (They usually asked a lot of questions before realizing what they were buying—and backed out.)  Money was a consideration, too. With modified consoles, it was a lump sum. People paid for the console and that was the end of the transaction. You didn't get anything else out of them. The people running stealth servers were charging monthly or weekly subscriptions for access.  He took a look at stealth servers and the software people were downloading to their modified consoles. They were built on the same coding languages he'd been learning in his spare time.  "I took a look at the source code," he said, "and realized 'Holy crap, this is a language I already know. I can do this. Why am I paying for something I can do?'" "I've read very carefully the laws that surround this [laughs]. I'm just the middleman. I've definitely covered my ass on that."  Andy launched his own service a few years back, but nobody paid attention. After partnering with some others in the scene on a server, he decided to refocus his efforts by building features you couldn't find elsewhere. This is how he landed on being able to launch a DDOS attack from an Xbox 360, which a friend suggested and he took on as a challenge.  It takes roughly a week and a half for Microsoft to discover a stealth server that Andy has spun up. After it's blocked, it's little effort for Andy to spin up another one. Rinse, repeat.  When I asked Andy about how modified consoles are often used for piracy, he hedged and said that's not what he built them for—it's just what people could use them for. He took the same approach when I pressed him on what good it does to allow people the ability to easily launch a DDOS attack through a console. Andy didn't deny DDOS attacks are inherently malicious, saying he builds them into his service because it's something no one else provides.  "I've read very carefully the laws that surround this [laughs]," he said. "I'm just the middleman. I'm not providing a botnet. I'm not providing any of the servers that do this. I'm just providing an input. I've definitely covered my ass on that."  (A botnet is a network of compromised Internet-connected devices, which can include anything from computers to thermostats, being asked to perform tasks, such as a DDOS attack.)  For the record, every legal expert I ran Andy's theory by told me it was bullshit.  "I would take anyone's claims of avoiding liability on a technicality with a heavy grain of salt," said attorney Ryan Morrison of Morrison/Lee, a gaming-focused firm. "It's almost impossible to guarantee that with certainty, and it always comes down to the facts of each individual case." An advertisement for Andy's services, which he sells via Skype. In any case, Andy sells access to his software at $40-per-month or a flat rate of $100. The influx of new people playing Black Ops 2 —at times, upwards of 70,000 have been online, tens of thousands more than what the game has seen in years—has proven profitable for him.  Andy isn't getting rich off his software, but according to him, it's enough to pay for some beers. When we spoke, he'd only made $40 on that particular day, but a more recently fruitful day had resulted in as much as $230. In addition to the money that comes from people who stumble upon his service, he relies on other people to sell it for him. He takes 70% of the sale.  Andy is small fry in the world of modifications and hacks. It's part of the reason he was even willing to talk with me. But he represents a regular cycle in the video game world, where old hardware is phased out and tinkerers begin to pick it apart. Some of it is benevolent—it's what leads to emulation, a form of archiving video game history—and some of it's undeniably questionable, like the ability to launch a DDOS attack. It's basically a digital wild west.  It's unclear how being able to launch a DDOS attack helps anyone, but it's also on Microsoft for reviving Black Ops 2 , knowing full well what's happened to security on that platform. Black Ops 2 is back, but it's also full of people who want to fuck with you.  There doesn't appear to be an endgame for Andy, nor does he strike me as someone who's purposely malicious—just indifferent. To an outsider—or someone who runs across one of his lobbies—there might not be a difference.  "I'm mainly just doing this as a project so I can gain a better understanding of what's going on and really perfect my coding abilities," he said. Follow Patrick on Twitter .

This was something of a surprise, as I had not attempted to buy any Microsoft points that day, so I logged into my Xbox Live account to find out what was going on.  Sure enough, all of the Microsoft points that were stored in my XBL account had been spent on in game items for FIFA 11 (I don’t own that game… hell, I don’t even like soccer video games) and whoever spent my MS points had then tried to purchase more. Presumably, when that purchase failed, they abandoned my account and went on to steal from some other unsuspecting gamer.  Upon making this discovery, I promptly called Xbox customer support. An apathetic young man who’s name escapes me at the moment answered, and after asking me a long series of questions designed to verify my identity, he told me that my account would be locked for “up to 25 days” while the issue was investigated.  He ended the call by reminding me to check out Xbox.com for more information on all the cool services I wouldn’t be using for the next month, adding insult to injury.  After about two weeks had passed, I decided to call in just to see if there was any news on the investigation. After navigating through the series of prompts 1-800-4-MY-XBOX had to offer, a woman with a thick Indian accent informed me that it would actually take 21 business days, not 25 calendar days, and she said I’d probably hear back sometime in October.  Finally on Monday October 3rd my Xbox Live account was reinstated, and Microsoft provided a code for a free month of XBL without my having to ask for it. Unfortunately, after following the instructions provided by Microsoft’s customer service department via email, I was unable to redeem that code. It turns out that by recovering my gamertag to my console I actually flagged the account to be locked again. Fortunately, this issue was corrected by a five minute phone call to customer service.  Once my account was back in order, I replied to the email I received with several questions I wanted answered. Below is an excerpt from that email.  First, how was my account breached? I don’t do anything with my windows live ID other than visit Xbox.com, and log into my Xbox 360, and I don’t give out passwords. For my protection, I’d like to know how the breach happened so I can take any necessary actions to prevent it in the future.  Second, which parts of my account were accessed by the hacker? If they accessed my credit card information in any way, I need to know about it so that I can contact any of the cards that may have been affected in order to prevent fraudulent charges.  Third, how do I go about removing all of my credit cards from my account? I will use cards purchased from stores to up my XBL subscription, and to purchase MS points – I no longer need, nor want any credit cards associated with this account, as it has proven to be insecure. email.  All of those points seemed like reasonable requests to me. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal would most likely agree with me, given that he had some choice words for Sony earlier this year when the Playstation Network was hacked, and millions of customers had their personal information stolen. In a letter to Jack Tretton, president and CEO of SCEA, Senator Blumenthal said the following:  When a data breach occurs, it is essential that customers be immediately notified about whether and to what extent their personal and financial information has been compromised. Additionally, PlayStation Network users should be provided with financial data security services, including free access to credit reporting services, for two years, the costs of which should be borne by Sony. Affected individuals should also be provided with sufficient insurance to protect them from the possible financial consequences of identity theft.  Microsoft doesn’t quite see eye to eye with me, or Senator Blumenthal, as evidenced by their response to my request.  Dear Xbox LIVE Customer:  We apologize, but we are not at liberty to explain our investigation process. However $ 16.03 has been refunded to your account. Refunds could take up to 5-10 business days prior to displaying in your billing activity. It may take 30 days or longer to appear on your statement, depending on your financial institution’s policies.  If you have any concerns regarding this notice, you may either reply to this message or contact Xbox Customer Support directly using the information available at http://www.xbox.com/support/contact and reference the Service Request number above.  Sincerely,  The Xbox LIVE Escalations Team  I emailed them back to let them know that I did appreciate the refund, but that I’d still need to know how my personal information was accessed in order to take any necessary precautions, and as of this writing, I haven’t received a response (though I’ll update this post if I do).  It’s also worth noting that they completely dodged the bit about removing credit cards from my XBL account. That’s because you have to have at least one payment method associated with your Xbox Live account. If you want to remove the credit card associated with Xbox Live autobilling, you’ll first have to associate a different card, or your Paypal account with XBL.  So, after a month long investigation, Microsoft will only acknowledge what I knew on September 6th – that someone other than myself accessed my Xbox Live account. They are either unable, or unwilling to give me any information about how my account was accessed, or about which (if any) pieces of my personal information were taken by the hacker. In other words, someone gained access to my account, may or may not have accessed my personal information, and spent my Microsoft points, and Microsoft does not intend to help to protect me from any of the potential hazards associated with having my personal information accessed.  At least when Sony gave out my personal information they offered identity theft protection to make up for it.  I reached out to Xbox Live’s Director of Policy and Enforcement Stephen Toulouse prior to writing this article for information on Microsoft’s end of the investigation process, but unfortunately, he did not return my email.  With no word from Microsoft on what information the hacker may have accessed, and no concrete information from Toulouse on Microsoft’s hacked account investigation process, I’m left feeling like my Xbox Live account may wind up being a security liability.  UPDATE : Both Ars Technica and Gizmodo have received the following response from Microsoft after inquiring about the recent rash of XBL hacking:  We do not have any evidence the Xbox LIVE service has been compromised. We take the security of our service seriously and work on an ongoing basis to improve it against evolving threats. However, a limited number of members have contacted us regarding unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals. We are working with our impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized changes to their accounts. As always, we highly recommend our members follow the Xbox LIVE Account Security guidance provided at www.xbox.com/security to protect your account  Well, at least the entirety of Xbox Live wasn’t hacked – that’s good news, right? This is still a fairly widespread issue if the comments and forums across the internet are any indication, and Microsoft would do well to consider additional security measures to prevent future hacking attempts from being successful.

Now this might not seem like a big deal to you but it is to me, I have decide if I do not get everything back I’m talking to my lawyer. I want to know why this is happening. To mention If you have a your GT attached to a WP7 phone you can’t change your password unless you want to lose all your games and data, I tried so thanks again MS   Reply             Salvador Pacheco  says:     October 5, 2011 at 5:29 pm      I got the same email also, but the Xbox Live CS did nothing to help me. Luckily the creditcard info I have on tied to my account is a dummy card that doesn’t even work anymore or at the time of the breach.

Reply         Guest  says:     October 13, 2011 at 3:34 pm      Same exact issue – if you do a little Googling you can find this topic being covered in several message boards, but nowhere online is there any actual coverage.  I’ve read that several people were told that the investigation is taking so long due to “unusually high volume”, which to me indicates that these aren’t isolated events.  I’ve read also that EA’s site was hacked not too long ago and that anyone who had an Xbox Live ID associated with it was at risk.  I checked the EA site and apparently I had created an account in 2008…for some reason that I can’t recall.  I don’t know if that’s a common factor in everyone else’s case, though.  I received an e-mail Tuesday about the purchase of 6000 MS points, followed by an e-mail for 4000 MS points and an e-mail about an additional e-mail address being added to my account.  I clicked the link to deny the e-mail address and immediately changed my Xbox Live password online.  I called Microsoft, who asked a long series of questions and stated that an investigation would begin and that it could take up to 25 days.  I asked about a refund and they stated that was dependent on the investigation.  Not liking that answer, I called my bank who immediately refunded the amount and issued me a new card.  I think I’m going to leave my old, useless card on the account and just pay with gift cards from now on…  The part that sucks is the account is locked during the investigation and I’m unable to use my Netflix streaming.

Reply         Mist  says:     October 25, 2011 at 10:08 am      I hate that we depend on a company like Microsoft to run our computers, our games, and our operating systems. This gigantic troll continues to club us down and offers little to no sating to constant questions. I understand they have a product, and anything worth value is worth protecting. Yet Microsoft is SO big they continuously fob their noses into the air and run over customers by their girth alone.  I am a student, I don’t have uber amounts of money laying around. These Fifa louses sucked the money from my bank account, so much so that I cannot afford the dentist appointment I had set up today and my back tooth is killing me. Maybe that’s why this post is so grumpy sounding.. yet I digress. 25 days just for the investigation THEN they MAY refund my money? I already called my credit company and they want to wait for the Microsoft reports. *sighs* I had to cancel my card and wait for a new one.. not that I have that much LEFT in my bank account at the moment. Not to mention the representative was nothing but haughty, rude, and demeaning to every small question I dared to asked. I know I might not sound like it at the moment but I was nothing but polite and patient during the course of our conversation.  Also to those of you saying I was asking for it by having payment information online, go suck the proverbial big one. That’s like saying I should never feel free to use any services that offer ‘protection’ against fraud. No one is ever asking for identity theft or fraud to occur. I must admit though that I don’t plan on using credit card information for any Xbox live account I MIGHT continue to use, and that’s a big one considering they are being so close lipped about this situation. I’m a customer, I pay you to service me, when the customer goes, the money goes with.. sadly Microsoft will survive thanks to their bullying tactics and egotistical manner. Hail consumerism.  My only question to Microsoft when I recieve my email regarding the investigation will be, When is enough, enough? We pay for your services, you should cater to our questions, and answer our simple requests about WHO got WHAT from OUR accounts. Thank you and good luck to everyone that was ripped off by those simpering monkey gits.   Reply         Kaoras  says:     October 29, 2011 at 6:05 am      It really bites, doesn’t it?  I had my tag hacked a couple days ago, and I only noticed when I checked my email that morning.  My account was, note was, linked to my boyfriend’s card, and it’s not like we’re living in the lap of luxury here.  We have no jobs, certainly not for a lack of looking, we barely have enough money as it is to take ourselves out to lunch every few weeks as a treat.  All we had in that account was a little more than a dollar, but now we have to pull 75 from thin air to cover this.  This might be minor to some issues, but the lunch thing was an especially nice treat in a depressing job economy that is in the town I live in, and now we might not have that for a long, long, long while as we try to recover finances to cover this really evil maneuver.  I did contact Xbox support, but I’m so really mad.  I wish they could get their just deserts.  The real kicker is that Microsoft isn’t acknowledging this as a widespread problem, and that makes it worse.  The funny part is that the hacker couldn’t get any more out of the account, which is probably why we are standing at 75 dollars, not hundreds.  I have to find some humor here, or else I’d be murderous mad.  Seriously, nice job, jerks.

Reply         Romina  says:     November 9, 2011 at 7:08 pm      This happened to me last night- I was trying to log onto XBL and it said my account was invalid, and then I saw that I had received two emails confirming the purchase of 8000 points each (over $100).  I called customer support and the lady- who was pleasant at first, but then quickly became apathetic- said that they would need to lock my account down for 25 days to investigage.. So pretty much the same story as everyone else.  This is such bullshit.  I don’t understand why one of the strongest gaming platforms doesn’t have better security or the sense to TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BETTER.. not treat us like criminals and lock us out.  I have to call back with my serial number and I’m going to be as pushy as I can and ask to speak with supervisors, etc, as well as address the concerns of this post- how did they hack my account, do they have my credit card information, et cetera.  Also I don’t understand why they have to kick us out of their accounts, rather than letting us play and maybe disabling purchases during the investigation process.  So angry.

You would think that they request you to log in to there servers and sign up to there systems they would make them secure.

Reply         In the Same Boat  says:     January 3, 2012 at 11:49 am      Just happened to me New Year’s Eve Day … I received some MS Pre-Paid point cards for xmas … One 4000 MS Pts and two 1600 Pts …. I decided to add them to my account so that I could get some DLC and maybe rent a movie or two.  Went to bed with 7200 pts in my account …  Got up the next morning, turned on  my xbox and one of the login messages came up saying “This account was previously logged into another console” …. Not knowing the gravity of what this really meant, I just dismissed it.  Went online, played some multiplayer games … That night I was settling in and thought of renting a movie … Made my movie selection, went to purchase and saw that I only had 20 MS pts left in my account.  WTF!!!!  I looked at my download history on my console … But the only things that showed up are DLC and movies that I downloaded myself.  So I logged into XBL Website and looked at the account history … And there is was Microsoft Gold Jumbo Pack.  They have also associated another email address with my Live Account.  Luckily, the credit card that I associated with my XBL account only has a $200 credit limit … So they can’t get much from me.  Looked at my Achievements … FIFA 12 is showing up with 2 achievements unlocked.  I immediately called Microsoft and told them about the breach … I can’t stand sports games, I personally would never play one or pick one up .. So it’s pretty ironic that it’s a sports game that has created this security loop hole.  The MS Support agent went on to tell me that EA Games is running some type of in game promotion for the FIFA game that allows players to win MS Points and then redeem them for cash in the form of a check that is mailed to them.  Isn’t that just awesome.  Way to go EA!!  Thanks to your unsecure “promotion” hundreds if not thousands of us are getting hacked around the globe.  After reading everything below I don’t know why we someone hasn’t started a class action lawsuit against Microsoft or EA games at this point.  This is Theft and Identity Fraud.  So I’m in the same boat … Account is locked out for the next 3-6 weeks .. No Netflix or Hulu streaming … No playing online with my friends enjoying the many games that I got for Christmas.   I know it could be much much worse after reading that some people were hit up for 10k or more MS point purchases.  I think that I will be removing my credit card from my XBL account and associating my PayPal account going forward.  At least with PayPal, I have it set up that in order to log into PayPal a security code is sent to my cell phone and that code must be inputting within 3 minutes of receipt.  So I feel that this account is at least locked down and secure.  I truly feel for anyone that has had this happen to them .. It feels like a complete violation and if Microsoft or EA would only fess up or at the very least close down this security loop hole it might make us feel better about using their offered services.

Reply         Egg Head  says:     January 8, 2012 at 12:12 am      Just happened to me. What a joke. My 360 hadn’t left my closet for nearly a year, and one day I decided to hop on and try out some new games. The next day, well, same story as the rest of you, and now I’m locked out of my own account while they perform their overstated, month long “investigation” that anyone with the access could do in a matter of minutes. A month? Are these people serious?  Why the lock out at all? Why don’t they just temporarily remove our payment plans and remaining MS points so we can continue using our account without worrying about money being lost if it’s broken into again? But of course not, that would actually make sense and be customer friendly. Microsoft obviously wants us to have to decide between losing a sum of money ($90 in my case) or being locked from what we thought was our property for up to 2 months.  It makes me ill that these crooks, and sadly I’m referring to Microsoft and not the “hackers”, get away with this crap.

After cursing my Internet and logging back in I got the “previously logged into another xbox” message.  I immediately knew I was being hacked.  As I went to pick up my laptop to Chang passwords, my girlfriends account logged in and her account was on my console, she didn’t own one.  Called just to make sure.  So I logged her in and changed her password and as I was doing that , my gt logged out.  I quickly logged in and same “other console” message.   I quickly changed my password aswell.   Luckily I still had my 2000 mp and kept force logging this guy off before he could spend my point and mess up my account.  Now I have to wait for tomorrow and call in, and I’m totally looking forward to having my account locked.   It better be back by mass effect 3 and raccoon city.   I don’t see how my account which gets logged in here in Los Angeles, CA one minute and the get logged in the UK doesn’t raise a red flag over at Microsoft. My heart goes out to those of you who lost money and have lost accounts and spent time waiting for Microsoft to “figure out” what happened.  If for some odd reason I end up losing my account, xbox will lose a long and faithful customer for good.   Reply         Anon  says:     January 15, 2012 at 9:26 pm      I was “FIFA” hacked.

GrannySmith1 Jul 11, 2013, 6:27 PM  If you've played xbox live or PSN before, and especially the call of duty series, you'll get the occasional pissed off player who gets mad at you and threatens to "hack" you and find your IP address. I'm sure that 99.99% of these claims are just complete BS and 99% of COD players don't know how to hack, but is there a legitimate chance that you can get hacked over xbox live or PSN by someone who actually knows how to hack? How do they do this and what are measures you can take to prevent this from happening to you? Most of the time, people will threaten to find my IP address and find out where I live, but again I find this to be complete BS. First off, how important is your IP address? Does it really show where you live, or is this just a misunderstanding?        3 answers   Last reply  Jul 13, 2013    Best Answer  Jul 11, 2013    More about  important address           bob1033 Jul 11, 2013, 6:52 PM  Haha, you probably encountered some 13 year old punk that thinks finding the school wifi password is 'hacking'. I've know a thing or two about pen testing (hacking into a system for legit reasons) and you can rest assured that no one can really hack you with JUST an ip address. An ip address does show your relative location though, but the error of margin is AT LEAST 15 miles, so they wouldn't be able to find you, maybe just the city you leave in.         Best answer     Tom Tancredi Jul 11, 2013, 7:03 PM  Okay this is both a BS and a truism at the sametime and let me explain a bit. Think of IPs like telephone numbers, there is only *1* number like that anywhere,  (especially as people have cell phones thus can be anywhere) so saying I will find out your telephone number and I can track you down personally to where you are who you are etc. is not normally true (BS). Just like you ABSOLUTELY have to have a telephone number assigned to the phone before you can call another telephone's number, the same with IPs. You need one to make the connection to the target end, to 'call' tomshardware and 'order' the website. Now here is where the tricky part you see hollywood really make more BS about, when you connect your network (not your computer!) from your home router to a ISP, you are 1 of hundred of thousands of its customers, so your given a 'random' IP from a pool for your state, county, area of town, that gets used by your ISP for that area. So if someone worked INSIDE the ISP, they could 'track' you by that IP to that 'area' and monitor for your connection, or have it recorded already to track back for resolving issues (HEY my internet is slow!). That is the Big Brother Government image coming to hunt you down you see, but it is still a possibility (Court Orders, committing a actual crime, etc.). Now just as your phone may be AT&T, the person your calling is MCI, how does AT&T connect to MCI? Much less two different phone of different customers in different locations 100% of the time reliably. Well that is the same question about the Internet (replace phone with computer). Basically a spiders web of connections and interconnections were made by Communications companies, they then were forced to play nice by legal / government enforcement, so they share these resources and interconnect them. The 'path' between San Franscisco to Miami isn't straight SE though, it actually could go South then East then North then hop back West before run across to the NE then south again for THAT SINGLE connection. The next time the person tries it could take a different route, based on traffic, outages, etc. So 'tracking' backwards isn't really going to happen as you can see, because you have to be able to access all the connecting points, different ISP providers, etc. to track the connection.         Can't find your answer ? Ask !    Get the answer         manofchalk Jul 13, 2013, 5:27 AM  Your IP address can determine your general location, but as mentioned above it would only be accurate to a couple of miles at most. As for any person you meet on Xbox Live's ability to hack into your home network, provided you don't tell them any information yourself or do anything they tell you, they cant. They aren't hosting the server your connecting too, so they cant track the IP addresses of each player. If their games console is hosting it, they wouldn't be able to look at that list anyway. If they did manage to get your IP address, the most they could do is send a ton of traffic to your IP address which hopefully would consume all your internet bandwidth, effectively cutting you off from the Internet. This is basically what happens when hacker groups like Anonymous decide they want to take down a website. However I doubt that will happen, an attack like that would require a large network of computers to all hammer your IP at once, something that a single hacker/script kiddy is unlikely to have available. As for them getting into the network, its not going to happen unless you let them in. Quite simply the weakest link in any network security is the human element, the chances of a person allowing a virus into a network is far higher than one managing to sneak/bust its way through your firewall. Look up Kevin Mitnick, one of the most successful hackers in the world and his main way of getting in was simply asking people to let him in. This also backs up the point Tom was making about Hollywood, when he was eventually caught, the judge had no idea of how hacking worked and denied him access to a phone in prison so that he couldn't start a nuclear war by whistling notes into the phone .

    - 9 years, 5 months ago Yes it is possible to have your account hacked. It's happened to me. I logged into Xbox.com and I couldn't sign in. Whoever did it changed all of my account info and stuff. Microsoft was very helpful when I gave them a call to see what was going on, they had everything fixed in about 45 minutes. I suggest that if you can't log on to anything give Microsoft a call. Or the guy could just be fooling with you. Whatever the case may be....watch out!!!!

Maybe he is just messing around, but I dont know. thegamesnake20 No one's gonna hack your account, it just aint gonna happen. The reason I say that is because you need more than a gamertag in order to hack or (fake hack) an account. The way most people hack peoples Xbox Live account is due to YOU giving out your own info because you think someones gonna give you Microsoft Points or achievements etc. it's more of a phishing scheme than an actual hack. So don't be worried about scums on Xbox Live saying they're gonna hack you, cuz it's not gonna happen unless you give your own info out without thinking.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago I already posted a thread the other day about this, but I would like to bring something up. When my account was hacked the hacker downloaded Portal and a few other arcade games. I go to look at the games and it asks me to "Download Again" So do I get them for free now? I canceled my credit card and they said they would be doing an investigation. Should I wait until after the investigation to download them? So they don't think I downloaded them and am blaming a hacker. And last of all I have never given out any information concerning gamertags, emails, passwords, etc. Carnifex726 Member Since: December 1, 2008 Posts: 407 Carnifex726 Follow Forum Posts: 407 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #2 Posted by Carnifex726 (407 posts)

    - 8 years, 7 months ago Considering your gamertag shows your last game played was portal I guess this thread is kinda irrelevant - you clearly downloaded and started playing it!    Basically once it is on your account the chances of getting a refund from MS are slim to none, so take some solace in the fact the "hacker" bought a decent game with your money.    In future don't enter your account details into any website, no matter how tempting the "offer" is for free MS points, free Live, free game, or anything else.  So called "hackers" don't just magically find your account details - the vast majority are phishing scams where the user willing enters their details into a site. bobdood99 Member Since: November 3, 2007 Posts: 1862 bobdood99 Follow Forum Posts: 1862 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #8 Posted by bobdood99 (1862 posts)

    - 8 years, 7 months ago I think people should stop referring to this type of situation as "My account was hacked." Your account wasn't "hacked". It was accessed by someone because you gave them your login details.    When you say hacked it sounds like someone broke into the Microsoft database and got your info from the Xbox Live server. People reading this might think it could happen to them because Microsoft isn't protecting their information properly. Your account wasn't "hacked" so you shouldn't say it was.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago Man It seems like everyones account is getting hacked. Be safe, don't download anything off the marketplace until the investigation is over. Carnifex726 I've been threatened over 300 times with the line "I'm gonna hack your account"... LITERALLY!! And you know how many times I've been hacked? Zero times. The way people's accounts are getting hacked is due to their own stupidity...don't give your info out to fake websites that say you'll get free Microsoft points, free map packs, in game cheats because there all fake. Also, going to the wrong website that you think is authentic is another big account stealer. Avoid all of the above and you won't have to worry about forfeiting your account. So there's no such thing as your account getting hacked! bobdood99 Member Since: November 3, 2007 Posts: 1862 bobdood99 Follow Forum Posts: 1862 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #17 Posted by bobdood99 (1862 posts)

    - 8 years, 7 months ago I already posted a thread the other day about this, but I would like to bring something up. When my account was hacked the hacker downloaded Portal and a few other arcade games. I go to look at the games and it asks me to "Download Again" So do I get them for free now? I canceled my credit card and they said they would be doing an investigation. Should I wait until after the investigation to download them? So they don't think I downloaded them and am blaming a hacker. And last of all I have never given out any information concerning gamertags, emails, passwords, etc. bobdood99 I'm sorry, but your account wasn't hacked. This isn't possible. Someone may have obtained your info by guessing, phishing, etc., but it is not possible to "hack" an Xbox Live account.

    - 8 years, 7 months ago Look, hacks can actually happen even if the guy doesn't go "my PW is..." Things that can happen: 1: Bad link in email puts keylogger on comp 2: Msn friend sends u a virus through their own virus 3: Xboxes can be modded to a computer to show the IP address of other players. Next step: send virus to that player's email 4: Advert, website, etc, when clicked on, can send you a virus. (even innocent looking things) My friend has been hacked before without giving any info out (honestly, not all of us are that stupid) and one of the four or more above things could have happened. Either that or your password recovery questions were easily guessable, the account was recovered, etc? (If you recover an acc, you can mod the xbox to your comp to make it guess the password... Nasty. I won't say how or reveal any hints in any shape or form but I know it CAN happen.) But anyway, to answer the topic question: If the game says "download again" it means the game is already on your profile and paid fore. It is free to download a second time. However, I would wait about a week before doing this to let the investigation finish.

    - 9 years, 5 months ago Having your IP address means nothing, since it has no direct link to your gamertag. With my old modem it obtained a new IP every time it connected, and with my current one it keeps the same one until I request a new one. It's easy to find out someone's IP and several forum users have a tool in their sig which shows your IP.

    - 9 years, 5 months ago I'm sorry but it is quite possible... This is not hacking per say but it serve the same deed. It's called Denial of service (DoS) and it consist of using the user IP to send lots of info and fool the servers into believing that YOUR IP is spaming everyone. Your Provider will then block your account for 1 week or so. Another way it can work is the other way around, Saturate your IP with packets sent until your IP/Computer reset or gets unsufficient resosurce to act (or very slowly). Since you won't be able to use the Internet, you will then believe that you've been hacked. It will come back but you be classified as a "spamer". It's an old technique that always work. No way to trace the guy who did it since this technique uses "dedicated" servers all around the world. Simple, efficient. iam2green Member Since: August 1, 2007 Posts: 13991 iam2green Follow Forum Posts: 13991 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #14 Posted by iam2green (13991 posts)

And even if he hacked your account, do you really think he is going to fly/drive/walk from wherever he lives to where you live because of a video game?  People that get that angry about games are generally losers who have nothing more important in their lives to be frustrated about, so I wouldn't worry about it.  I have heard stories of people reporting stuff like that to the police (who CAN and DO get into Xbox Live accounts when necessary) and the threatening person being arrested.  After all, it's really no different than me standing face to face with you and saying I am going to find and hurt you.  So if you are worried, call the cops.

    - 7 years, 10 months ago it can be done yes, but contrary to popular beleif its not easy, hes most likely bluffing but if youre worried change some of your details just to give them a harder time of it, like your email, your credit.debit card if you can, password etc etc,    changing your password regularly is actually recommended with any internet based account, Wyle1111 Member Since: October 6, 2009 Posts: 25 Wyle1111 Follow Forum Posts: 25 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #23 Posted by Wyle1111 (25 posts)

    - 7 years, 2 months ago yo, I was playing Halo 3 the other day, and our team was losing. The guy flipped out and said he was going to hack our accounts. I just taunted him and told him to go for it. He quit the game and said he got my ip. Is it even possible to "hack" an Xbox Live account by just playing with the person? o.O I honestly think he's just being stupid, but it does have me wonderin hehe.

    - 9 years, 11 months ago People can't just magically "hack" your account information. The people who had their accounts stolen, had them stolen in the usual way... they gave out their information somewhere, like on a website or in an email, their friends knew their info and passed it on to other people, they had a keylogger on their computer, or someone managed to get the password to their email because their password was too short or obvious. If someone does get your account somehow, they cannot steal your credit card info as that is not displayed, they can only buy MS points, and I believe you can cancel the transaction by talking to your credit card company. zaokamura Member Since: January 21, 2004 Posts: 1719 zaokamura Follow Forum Posts: 1719 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #6 Posted by zaokamura (1719 posts)

    - 9 years, 11 months ago Yes... Xbox Live is safe for credit cards... some people are just scared (understandably) giving their information to anyone, including Microsoft. Kind of ironic if they still use them at stores, but whatever. Using your credit card on XBL is no different then using it at a Walmart or on Amazon.com.

    - 9 years, 11 months ago You almost certainly have fraud protection with your credit card company and anyone who thinks they're cool enough to hack MS let them. I've been running a credit card membership since launch. No problems. Plus whenever you suddenly need MSPOINTS you can order them instantly and buy whatever expansion/arcade game you need. You dont have to run out to a store to buy a card. XBOX live will renew automatically every year so you won't have worry about that either. msjr78 Member Since: October 19, 2005 Posts: 4004 msjr78 Follow Forum Posts: 4004 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 0 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #11 Posted by msjr78 (4004 posts)

    - 9 years, 7 months ago My brother tried to sign in to his account and it gave him the error message that you receive when your account has been recovered on someone else's 360.  It wouldn't let him recover it.  I looked at my friend's list for his gamerpicture and it was under another name.  He tried that gamertag along with the email and password, and he recovered it just fine.  The only problem is that the guy who took his account used 800 of his microsoft points to change the gamertag (I assume so my brother couldn't find it).  He doesn't want to file an official complaint, but I sure as hell do.  I don't want my account hacked - this crap needs to be reported.  I have called 1-800-4MY-XBOX enough times to know that if I call them about this, they will have no idea what to do (I can't even understand them anyways).

    - 9 years, 7 months ago So your brother got his gamertag back? If so, tell him to change his WINDOWS ID password to something completely different then what it was before. So it can't be stolen again. As for reporting a person who took the gamertag, I dunno if anything can be done.

    - 9 years, 7 months ago By the sounds of it your brother gave out his e-mail and password to a site that wasn't xbox.com or some other source that got his account stollen. However that doesn't seem to be the case cause phising scams will then change the e-mail and password to something else so you cannot re access the account. It sounds to me like your brother gave his account to a friend or something who then just decided to be an idiot and change it. Or you or your brother are not giving us the full story. Basically all you can do is change the password to the e-mail address and suck it up, a report isn't going to do anything, you can do the same as well and try to be more careful with who you give your personal information next time....

    - 9 years, 7 months ago [QUOTE="xRmRxfreakBOMB"] [QUOTE="Arcade-Fire"][QUOTE="mECHwARRIORx2"]My brother tried to sign in to his account and it gave him the error message that you receive when your account has been recovered on someone else's 360. It wouldn't let him recover it. I looked at my friend's list for his gamerpicture and it was under another name. He tried that gamertag along with the email and password, and he recovered it just fine. The only problem is that the guy who took his account used 800 of his microsoft points to change the gamertag (I assume so my brother couldn't find it). He doesn't want to file an official complaint, but I sure as hell do. I don't want my account hacked - this crap needs to be reported. I have called 1-800-4MY-XBOX enough times to know that if I call them about this, they will have no idea what to do (I can't even understand them anyways).

Odds are your brother gave him the password because the perpetrator probably told him he can give him free points or easy achievements. So in Microsoft's eyes that's negligent and stupidity. So you need to talk to your brother and ask him who he gave the password to. There's no way for someone to hack your account. And I know there's some hype person gonna come in here and say other wise. Anyways, tell him in the future not to give his password to random people on Live that say they can do things for him, cuz it's lies. p00phead Member Since: May 15, 2007 Posts: 1203 p00phead Follow Forum Posts: 1203 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 2 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #18 Posted by p00phead (1203 posts)

    - 9 years, 3 months ago I remember reading about this last year. What these people do is keep calling Microsoft a lot with the gamertag they want, claiming to have just forgotten the password, requesting it to be reset. Now protocol is for Microsoft to ask your name, address and answer your secret question but there are a few idiots at Microsoft that don't follow that procedure and do it anyway. These people know the best times of days to do this (my guess first thing in morning, last thing at night and busy times) and do it to steal your gamer score, ms points and worst, your identity in the real world as they can obtain your name, address, D.O.B. etc. Microsoft are aware of this and yet have no official comment as it is their own staff being negligent Now before people start saying that I am to bash the 360, I am a 360 patriot, launch console and all:DI just remember this on gamespot last yea r chaoscougar1 Member Since: April 7, 2005 Posts: 37597 chaoscougar1 Follow Forum Posts: 37597 Followed by: 0 Reviews: 13 Stacks: 0 Forum Karma: 0 #26 Posted by chaoscougar1 (37597 posts)

The Xbox 360&apos;s FIFA Phishing Continues Unabated Since October, we&apos;ve heard anecdotal accounts of Xbox Live members finding suspicious… Read more Read Advertisement At first believed to be the result of hacks in relation to EA's FIFA series , it's now looking more likely to be the result of a widespread scam run by shady types out to either make money or score cheap games. FIFA -Loving Hackers Strike Xbox Live Accounts Xbox Live users should keep an eye on their accounts, and any credit card associated with that… Read more Read One of the more high profile victims of these "jackings" (not "hacks," we'll get to that in a minute) was Susan Taylor, who wrote an account of her experiences, and which we covered back in January . Having stood up and identified herself as an unhappy victim, Susan soon got something she was probably never expecting: members of the jacking community reaching out to her. Advertisement Is the Xbox Live "Hacking" Problem Worse Than Microsoft Realises? So late last year, people began to complain that their Xbox Live accounts were being… Read more Read UPDATE - See bottom of post for update from Microsoft. Three such types contacted Susan and tipped her off to sites and forums where jackers congregate and trade. They were also, as members, able to access the sites (most are obviously restricted from public viewing) and pass along some of the information contained within, including techniques on how to obtain someone else's Xbox Live account information. Advertisement You can see one such site, which is publicly accessible, here . On its "black market" forum, you'll see members both selling stolen Xbox Live accounts and making requests, one person looking for an account with good Modern Warfare 3 stats, another selling an account with the presumably desirable name of "One V One". The key distinction between "jacking" and "hacking" is that these guys aren't forcefully circumventing any software protection measures. What they're doing is, in a nutshell, contacting Microsoft, pretending to be the legitimate account holder, and through poor security and a whole lot of bluffing (usually making excuses as to why information was incorrect or why passwords could not be remembered), getting hold of the necessary reference numbers and information they need to then go on and access a stranger's Xbox Live account. Here's an excerpt Susan was able to obtain, outlining one such strategy: PERSON A 1. First you go to Xbox.com and click support at the top left of the website. 2. Then go to the bottom of the page and click Contact Us. 3. Once on that page click the Email Us link. Then click Xbox Live. 4. Now this is where it gets SERIOUS. For the name put a name. I personally use an actual agent's name ([Name redacted by Kotaku]) then put there employee ID which I put a fake ID. For the reason put Technical Support. Then for the email put XXXX@microsoft.com or something to do with the agent's name but Microsoft. For the reason put something like this "Customer (put there name if you have it on the account you want) verified the 16 Credit Card digit number. He has made an inquiry about how he has forgotten his accounts information, since I am a Tier 1 agent I am unable to view the customers GT. He has requested to have the answer changed to (put some realistic for the answer). The Xbox Live Gamertag is (put GT). – [Name redacted by Kotaku]" (IMAGE) 5. Now you should see something like this (IMAGE) 6. Call up Xbox 30 minutes later. After they answer say that you were disconnected from a Tier 2 agent and ask to be transferred back. 7. After they transfer you to the Tier 2 agent give them the number (remember your the customer so you have to act like you have pretty much no idea what's on it). Once they pull it up they will take a little while and change it. DO NOT ASK FOR THE EMAIL so that you can know where to reset it. 8. Then call back and say you forgot your email but know your Secret question answer. They will ask for the GT and answer tell them and they will give you the email. Congrats now you get the OG. This wont work every time so don't get discouraged. Advertisement That sounds depressingly simple. Here's another one. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PHISHING clearly as you know all too well but MS tries to hide this very well. This is called by the hackers ad "Jacking an account" and what i talk about below is probably not even entered your head as how your account was taken. The main thing is that reference number you get, see how they helped you with just a reference number and no other proof you were who you said??? Basically they ring other small companies associated with MS after getting a reference number associated with your gamertag/zune account. To get the reference number they ring either xbox or zune support and when asked about security info such as name they give fake info and then say "Oh if thats not right my brother must have changed it, hes not in so can i have a reference number to call you back when he is home?" These smaller companies release your name and more and literally all i or the hacker would have to say after giving them the reference number is "Could you help me verify the information on my account please". Being a smaller, clueless company they give info out like your name or address. They then call back repeatedly getting different info (this is a lengthy process as not every agent is stupid but these people spend days/weeks targetting accounts) Bear if mind they will get your email address from this process and that pretty much seals the accounts fate into being hacked. Most people use the same email and their real/same info for everything so if they see on xbox.com you have netflix or something similar like that they will call netflix and they have all the right name and address ect. So one example of something i would do and what these people do is to say to netflix "I purchased a new subscription but its not showing up can you check you have the right payment option on file" because the hacker can give all the correct info to netflix or whoever elses service it is and they will cluelessly give out the last 4 digits of the Credit Card. Now with the last 4 digits of a credit card a password reset form is almost certain to be successful when the hackers submits one through the windows live page when you click forgot password. But there are also hotlines were agents will reset the password over the phone when the hacker provides all this info because they are bound to believe someone with the last four of a CC right? so they help the hacker get your account. There are literally TONS of different little tactics here and there that these people or I used to use to get different bits of infomation and i only skim over it briefly above obviously because it would be too lengthy to try and explain it with written words in one email. Advertisement As you can see, if this stuff is indeed the kind of methodology used by jackers, it's a far more serious problem than a flaw in Xbox Live's code or immediate security. That sort of thing can be patched, the holes plugged. What Susan's sources are describing though, that's something else. That's a failure of bureaucracy. Something broken at a systemic and fundamental level of Microsoft's customer service system, a result of under-trained and outsourced staff not knowing the finer details of the service's security framework. Which is a lot harder, and slower to fix. It would also explain why it's been so hard for Microsoft to track down the problem. It's been looking for a problem , something obvious, a chink in Xbox Live's armour. What's being described here, acts of deception carried out on a personal level with customer service staff, wouldn't even come up on their radar. Advertisement BUT WHY? The raft of thefts reveal that Xbox Live accounts are big business. Definitely worth the trouble of getting hold of. But why? It appears there's a market for all kinds of accounts and the things related to them. The most obvious, and lucrative for the more criminally-minded, are accounts with credit card or PayPal info linked to them. Once loaded up with "free" Microsoft Points, they're then sold off to buyers who get thousands of points for a lot less than they'd normally have paid for them. Another money-saving motivation is free games. If an account has purchased any Games on Demand titles, for example, those games are linked to the account, meaning the new owner can jump onto Xbox Live and download the games "again" for free. Surprise surprise, the most valuable accounts are ones with Call of Duty titles attached. Advertisement Two other reasons, though, are a little more vain. Some black market buyers want access to "OG" usernames. They don't want, for example, "b08". They want "Bob", or names related to pop culture figures, or movie stars, or dumb shit like "Killer". The more interesting OG handles are thus targets for jackers, and can be sold for hundreds of dollars. The other cosmetic lure is a user's tenure. In the corner of your Xbox Live avatar there's a number. The higher the number, the longer you've been a member. Long-time members—we're talking 5-6+ years—are of course the most valuable, and are a target for jackers who can sell them to people who want to look more seasoned on Xbox Live than they actually are. Advertisement PREVENTION If these reports are accurate, then what can you do to protect your account? It would appear you can't do anything at all. Unlike a phishing scam, which you can head off by changing passwords, these jackers are bypassing the user entirely and going straight to Microsoft support. If they see a gamertag they think can make them money, then they'll pull their support scam, and if they can pull it off (as stated above, often they're unsuccessful) there's not a thing you'd be able to do about it. About the only recommendations would be to do what you should be doing anyway: keep your passwords separate, don't link credit card information to an account and use a dedicated email account for just your Xbox Live, nothing else. At least then you're minimising the damage, cutting down on the possibilities that by stealing your account details these scammers also get access to other online services of yours. Advertisement Bear in mind that while these reports may seem convincing, given their origin and the fact nobody but Microsoft knows the full extent of how its own support network operates, the means of account "jacking" should be treated as rumour until we're able to confirm them. As such, we've contacted Microsoft, and will update if we hear back. UPDATE Asked for comment, Microsoft has responded to Kotaku with the following: There are several different methods malicious users employ to gain unauthorized access to accounts; social engineering is one of them. We are aware of the vulnerabilities that social engineering poses, and continue to address these through tools and training to help keep our members safe and secure. The security of Xbox LIVE member accounts is a top priority and we continue to take aggressive steps to protect our members against ever-changing threats. This includes continually evolving our security practices and staff training to help prevent these scenarios from occurring. Advertisement On the specific examples highlighted: We really appreciate that these issues have been raised; however, the specific examples in this article contain information that is invalid and out-of-date. We would welcome the opportunity to work directly with Ms. Taylor and the members who have contacted her with unresolved cases. We have done a considerable amount of work to resolve cases for our customers in the last several months and will be reaching out to her to provide further assistance. And finally, advice from Microsoft on protecting your account: Engaging in identity theft, trading in stolen accounts and committing credit card fraud is all illegal, and those involved in this activity risk criminal prosecution. The activity also violates our Terms of Use, and we are actively stepping up account and console bans for both sellers and buyers of known stolen accounts and content. Finally, many of our security enhancements and recovery processes, should an account become stolen , are dependent upon our members being able to verify their identities using additional proofs, such as secondary email addresses, phone numbers, security questions and answers, or trusted devices. Adding strong identity proofs to an account provides multiple layers of identity verification, which can drastically reduce the incidence of identity theft and other online fraud.

He's there to sell you software that'll let you launch a DDOS attack from your Xbox 360. SHARE TWEET Call of Duty fan karter0, excited that Black Ops 2 was now backwards compatible on Xbox One, booted up the game. They quickly found themselves in a compromised lobby, where a hacker had taken control and folks ran around at lightning speeds. Before karter0 left the game, worried it might flag his account for suspicious activity, he took note of the host's gamertag. When karter0 looked them up on Twitter, they found someone charging $5 for "recoveries," a common hacker term for a service to alter a player's stats, in Black Ops 2 .  For the purposes of this story, we'll call this hacker Andy. He asked to remain anonymous, and as such, I've masked both his personal identity and the software and services he develops for Xbox 360.  Why was this a problem at all? Well, when Black Ops 2 became backwards compatible, Microsoft neglected to mention that everyone playing Black Ops 2 would be forced to do so on Xbox 360 servers. This meant joining an abandoned playground largely been taken up by hackers in the years since Xbox One launched, as Microsoft turned their security attention towards its current console. Call of Duty images courtesy of Activision Blizzard. "Yeah, they've been ignoring it since Xbox One came out pretty much," said a hacker who goes by the name enMTW. "It's not hard to detect these kind of services, but Microsoft doesn't seem interested in doing anything about it. They used to ban this kind of stuff constantly. These services were incredibly expensive. Now anyone can get online and cheat like mad."  When contacted, Microsoft urged the community to help them track hackers.  "We put gamers at the center of everything we do," said a Microsoft spokesperson, "and we'll continue to investigate reports from the community to help ensure that gamers on Xbox Live adhere to our Code of Conduct ."  Activision did not respond to my request for comment.  If you've played a Call of Duty game online before, chances are you've encountered a lobby like this, often indistinguishable from a normal one. Someone with a hacked console has an enormous amount of control and subversion tools. On the surface, it seemed like this Andy was luring folks into seemingly normal Black Ops 2 lobbies, screwing with their accounts, and charging $5 to fix it.  Andy, who I talked to recently over Skype, denies that Twitter account is his—"I don't fuck with people's accounts"—but freely admitted to operating compromised Black Ops 2 lobbies where he messes around with people. He didn't build the tool that compromises Black Ops 2 , but it certainly gives him a lot of power. He can freeze a player's Xbox 360, kick them from the game, and even snoop around to discover their IP address, which can easily be used to learn where they live. (IPs can't be used to pinpoint a specific location, more of a general vicinity.) It's not hard to look up the IPs of players who are playing game with the right tools. Image courtesy of Andy. Typically, though, what Andy does is flip on infinite ammo and other hacks to get people's attention, before he advertises his Instagram feed. Why Instagram? That's where Andy's side business lives, the place where he advertises his customized Xbox 360 software.  Calling it software is somewhat misleading. What Andy has built is called a stealth server, a service that allows you to slip a modded console onto Xbox Live, and when you connect, you get access to custom features specific to his software. These range from the simple—UI color customization, adding a welcome message when you login—to the ethically dubious, such as the ability to launch a DDOS attack from your Xbox 360. To someone who's used an Xbox 360 before, it simply looks like a modified version of the interface that Microsoft had used for years, and when used in combination with other tools, like the Black Ops 2 one referenced above, it gives the user a lot of leeway to begin messing with the experiences of other people online.  Andy's custom software looks a lot like an Xbox 360 interface. These services often allow you to execute certain features directly from an Xbox 360, while often allowing for a direct connection to a nearby PC, which can also interact with the console.  21-year-old Andy began futzing around with consoles when he was 16.  "I've always been kind of techy," he said, "so I figured, 'Well, I'll start modifying consoles for my friends.'"  The primary reason his friends wanted modified consoles isn't surprising: piracy.  "I don't condone that, of course," he said. "I … [pause] I don't. [pause] That's the main reason why people want modified consoles."  Around this time, Andy, who comes from a military family, joined the army. He put modifying on hold, partially because of the job and partially because he was tired of the clientele, which often included confused parents buying a modified console for their kids. (They usually asked a lot of questions before realizing what they were buying—and backed out.)  Money was a consideration, too. With modified consoles, it was a lump sum. People paid for the console and that was the end of the transaction. You didn't get anything else out of them. The people running stealth servers were charging monthly or weekly subscriptions for access.  He took a look at stealth servers and the software people were downloading to their modified consoles. They were built on the same coding languages he'd been learning in his spare time.  "I took a look at the source code," he said, "and realized 'Holy crap, this is a language I already know. I can do this. Why am I paying for something I can do?'" "I've read very carefully the laws that surround this [laughs]. I'm just the middleman. I've definitely covered my ass on that."  Andy launched his own service a few years back, but nobody paid attention. After partnering with some others in the scene on a server, he decided to refocus his efforts by building features you couldn't find elsewhere. This is how he landed on being able to launch a DDOS attack from an Xbox 360, which a friend suggested and he took on as a challenge.  It takes roughly a week and a half for Microsoft to discover a stealth server that Andy has spun up. After it's blocked, it's little effort for Andy to spin up another one. Rinse, repeat.  When I asked Andy about how modified consoles are often used for piracy, he hedged and said that's not what he built them for—it's just what people could use them for. He took the same approach when I pressed him on what good it does to allow people the ability to easily launch a DDOS attack through a console. Andy didn't deny DDOS attacks are inherently malicious, saying he builds them into his service because it's something no one else provides.  "I've read very carefully the laws that surround this [laughs]," he said. "I'm just the middleman. I'm not providing a botnet. I'm not providing any of the servers that do this. I'm just providing an input. I've definitely covered my ass on that."  (A botnet is a network of compromised Internet-connected devices, which can include anything from computers to thermostats, being asked to perform tasks, such as a DDOS attack.)  For the record, every legal expert I ran Andy's theory by told me it was bullshit.  "I would take anyone's claims of avoiding liability on a technicality with a heavy grain of salt," said attorney Ryan Morrison of Morrison/Lee, a gaming-focused firm. "It's almost impossible to guarantee that with certainty, and it always comes down to the facts of each individual case." An advertisement for Andy's services, which he sells via Skype. In any case, Andy sells access to his software at $40-per-month or a flat rate of $100. The influx of new people playing Black Ops 2 —at times, upwards of 70,000 have been online, tens of thousands more than what the game has seen in years—has proven profitable for him.  Andy isn't getting rich off his software, but according to him, it's enough to pay for some beers. When we spoke, he'd only made $40 on that particular day, but a more recently fruitful day had resulted in as much as $230. In addition to the money that comes from people who stumble upon his service, he relies on other people to sell it for him. He takes 70% of the sale.  Andy is small fry in the world of modifications and hacks. It's part of the reason he was even willing to talk with me. But he represents a regular cycle in the video game world, where old hardware is phased out and tinkerers begin to pick it apart. Some of it is benevolent—it's what leads to emulation, a form of archiving video game history—and some of it's undeniably questionable, like the ability to launch a DDOS attack. It's basically a digital wild west.  It's unclear how being able to launch a DDOS attack helps anyone, but it's also on Microsoft for reviving Black Ops 2 , knowing full well what's happened to security on that platform. Black Ops 2 is back, but it's also full of people who want to fuck with you.  There doesn't appear to be an endgame for Andy, nor does he strike me as someone who's purposely malicious—just indifferent. To an outsider—or someone who runs across one of his lobbies—there might not be a difference.  "I'm mainly just doing this as a project so I can gain a better understanding of what's going on and really perfect my coding abilities," he said. Follow Patrick on Twitter .

This was something of a surprise, as I had not attempted to buy any Microsoft points that day, so I logged into my Xbox Live account to find out what was going on.  Sure enough, all of the Microsoft points that were stored in my XBL account had been spent on in game items for FIFA 11 (I don’t own that game… hell, I don’t even like soccer video games) and whoever spent my MS points had then tried to purchase more. Presumably, when that purchase failed, they abandoned my account and went on to steal from some other unsuspecting gamer.  Upon making this discovery, I promptly called Xbox customer support. An apathetic young man who’s name escapes me at the moment answered, and after asking me a long series of questions designed to verify my identity, he told me that my account would be locked for “up to 25 days” while the issue was investigated.  He ended the call by reminding me to check out Xbox.com for more information on all the cool services I wouldn’t be using for the next month, adding insult to injury.  After about two weeks had passed, I decided to call in just to see if there was any news on the investigation. After navigating through the series of prompts 1-800-4-MY-XBOX had to offer, a woman with a thick Indian accent informed me that it would actually take 21 business days, not 25 calendar days, and she said I’d probably hear back sometime in October.  Finally on Monday October 3rd my Xbox Live account was reinstated, and Microsoft provided a code for a free month of XBL without my having to ask for it. Unfortunately, after following the instructions provided by Microsoft’s customer service department via email, I was unable to redeem that code. It turns out that by recovering my gamertag to my console I actually flagged the account to be locked again. Fortunately, this issue was corrected by a five minute phone call to customer service.  Once my account was back in order, I replied to the email I received with several questions I wanted answered. Below is an excerpt from that email.  First, how was my account breached? I don’t do anything with my windows live ID other than visit Xbox.com, and log into my Xbox 360, and I don’t give out passwords. For my protection, I’d like to know how the breach happened so I can take any necessary actions to prevent it in the future.  Second, which parts of my account were accessed by the hacker? If they accessed my credit card information in any way, I need to know about it so that I can contact any of the cards that may have been affected in order to prevent fraudulent charges.  Third, how do I go about removing all of my credit cards from my account? I will use cards purchased from stores to up my XBL subscription, and to purchase MS points – I no longer need, nor want any credit cards associated with this account, as it has proven to be insecure. email.  All of those points seemed like reasonable requests to me. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal would most likely agree with me, given that he had some choice words for Sony earlier this year when the Playstation Network was hacked, and millions of customers had their personal information stolen. In a letter to Jack Tretton, president and CEO of SCEA, Senator Blumenthal said the following:  When a data breach occurs, it is essential that customers be immediately notified about whether and to what extent their personal and financial information has been compromised. Additionally, PlayStation Network users should be provided with financial data security services, including free access to credit reporting services, for two years, the costs of which should be borne by Sony. Affected individuals should also be provided with sufficient insurance to protect them from the possible financial consequences of identity theft.  Microsoft doesn’t quite see eye to eye with me, or Senator Blumenthal, as evidenced by their response to my request.  Dear Xbox LIVE Customer:  We apologize, but we are not at liberty to explain our investigation process. However $ 16.03 has been refunded to your account. Refunds could take up to 5-10 business days prior to displaying in your billing activity. It may take 30 days or longer to appear on your statement, depending on your financial institution’s policies.  If you have any concerns regarding this notice, you may either reply to this message or contact Xbox Customer Support directly using the information available at http://www.xbox.com/support/contact and reference the Service Request number above.  Sincerely,  The Xbox LIVE Escalations Team  I emailed them back to let them know that I did appreciate the refund, but that I’d still need to know how my personal information was accessed in order to take any necessary precautions, and as of this writing, I haven’t received a response (though I’ll update this post if I do).  It’s also worth noting that they completely dodged the bit about removing credit cards from my XBL account. That’s because you have to have at least one payment method associated with your Xbox Live account. If you want to remove the credit card associated with Xbox Live autobilling, you’ll first have to associate a different card, or your Paypal account with XBL.  So, after a month long investigation, Microsoft will only acknowledge what I knew on September 6th – that someone other than myself accessed my Xbox Live account. They are either unable, or unwilling to give me any information about how my account was accessed, or about which (if any) pieces of my personal information were taken by the hacker. In other words, someone gained access to my account, may or may not have accessed my personal information, and spent my Microsoft points, and Microsoft does not intend to help to protect me from any of the potential hazards associated with having my personal information accessed.  At least when Sony gave out my personal information they offered identity theft protection to make up for it.  I reached out to Xbox Live’s Director of Policy and Enforcement Stephen Toulouse prior to writing this article for information on Microsoft’s end of the investigation process, but unfortunately, he did not return my email.  With no word from Microsoft on what information the hacker may have accessed, and no concrete information from Toulouse on Microsoft’s hacked account investigation process, I’m left feeling like my Xbox Live account may wind up being a security liability.  UPDATE : Both Ars Technica and Gizmodo have received the following response from Microsoft after inquiring about the recent rash of XBL hacking:  We do not have any evidence the Xbox LIVE service has been compromised. We take the security of our service seriously and work on an ongoing basis to improve it against evolving threats. However, a limited number of members have contacted us regarding unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals. We are working with our impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized changes to their accounts. As always, we highly recommend our members follow the Xbox LIVE Account Security guidance provided at www.xbox.com/security to protect your account  Well, at least the entirety of Xbox Live wasn’t hacked – that’s good news, right? This is still a fairly widespread issue if the comments and forums across the internet are any indication, and Microsoft would do well to consider additional security measures to prevent future hacking attempts from being successful.

A few days later someone stole my GT name (it’s not something you can just make up) SO I rang back MS and said Ummm I want my name back too why didn’t you block anyone from taking it??? The thing on the line said OH you want everything back? I’ll make a note and we might be able to get it back for you.  Now this might not seem like a big deal to you but it is to me, I have decide if I do not get everything back I’m talking to my lawyer. I want to know why this is happening.

Reply         Guest  says:     October 13, 2011 at 3:34 pm      Same exact issue – if you do a little Googling you can find this topic being covered in several message boards, but nowhere online is there any actual coverage.  I’ve read that several people were told that the investigation is taking so long due to “unusually high volume”, which to me indicates that these aren’t isolated events.  I’ve read also that EA’s site was hacked not too long ago and that anyone who had an Xbox Live ID associated with it was at risk.  I checked the EA site and apparently I had created an account in 2008…for some reason that I can’t recall.  I don’t know if that’s a common factor in everyone else’s case, though.  I received an e-mail Tuesday about the purchase of 6000 MS points, followed by an e-mail for 4000 MS points and an e-mail about an additional e-mail address being added to my account.  I clicked the link to deny the e-mail address and immediately changed my Xbox Live password online.  I called Microsoft, who asked a long series of questions and stated that an investigation would begin and that it could take up to 25 days.  I asked about a refund and they stated that was dependent on the investigation.  Not liking that answer, I called my bank who immediately refunded the amount and issued me a new card.  I think I’m going to leave my old, useless card on the account and just pay with gift cards from now on…  The part that sucks is the account is locked during the investigation and I’m unable to use my Netflix streaming.

Reply         Mist  says:     October 25, 2011 at 10:08 am      I hate that we depend on a company like Microsoft to run our computers, our games, and our operating systems. This gigantic troll continues to club us down and offers little to no sating to constant questions. I understand they have a product, and anything worth value is worth protecting. Yet Microsoft is SO big they continuously fob their noses into the air and run over customers by their girth alone.  I am a student, I don’t have uber amounts of money laying around. These Fifa louses sucked the money from my bank account, so much so that I cannot afford the dentist appointment I had set up today and my back tooth is killing me. Maybe that’s why this post is so grumpy sounding.. yet I digress. 25 days just for the investigation THEN they MAY refund my money? I already called my credit company and they want to wait for the Microsoft reports. *sighs* I had to cancel my card and wait for a new one.. not that I have that much LEFT in my bank account at the moment. Not to mention the representative was nothing but haughty, rude, and demeaning to every small question I dared to asked. I know I might not sound like it at the moment but I was nothing but polite and patient during the course of our conversation.  Also to those of you saying I was asking for it by having payment information online, go suck the proverbial big one. That’s like saying I should never feel free to use any services that offer ‘protection’ against fraud. No one is ever asking for identity theft or fraud to occur. I must admit though that I don’t plan on using credit card information for any Xbox live account I MIGHT continue to use, and that’s a big one considering they are being so close lipped about this situation. I’m a customer, I pay you to service me, when the customer goes, the money goes with.. sadly Microsoft will survive thanks to their bullying tactics and egotistical manner. Hail consumerism.  My only question to Microsoft when I recieve my email regarding the investigation will be, When is enough, enough? We pay for your services, you should cater to our questions, and answer our simple requests about WHO got WHAT from OUR accounts. Thank you and good luck to everyone that was ripped off by those simpering monkey gits.   Reply         Kaoras  says:     October 29, 2011 at 6:05 am      It really bites, doesn’t it?  I had my tag hacked a couple days ago, and I only noticed when I checked my email that morning.  My account was, note was, linked to my boyfriend’s card, and it’s not like we’re living in the lap of luxury here.  We have no jobs, certainly not for a lack of looking, we barely have enough money as it is to take ourselves out to lunch every few weeks as a treat.  All we had in that account was a little more than a dollar, but now we have to pull 75 from thin air to cover this.  This might be minor to some issues, but the lunch thing was an especially nice treat in a depressing job economy that is in the town I live in, and now we might not have that for a long, long, long while as we try to recover finances to cover this really evil maneuver.  I did contact Xbox support, but I’m so really mad.  I wish they could get their just deserts.  The real kicker is that Microsoft isn’t acknowledging this as a widespread problem, and that makes it worse.  The funny part is that the hacker couldn’t get any more out of the account, which is probably why we are standing at 75 dollars, not hundreds.  I have to find some humor here, or else I’d be murderous mad.  Seriously, nice job, jerks.

I didn’t have any credit card info on there but I only use a pre-paid credit card anyhow.

Reply         Romina  says:     November 9, 2011 at 7:08 pm      This happened to me last night- I was trying to log onto XBL and it said my account was invalid, and then I saw that I had received two emails confirming the purchase of 8000 points each (over $100).  I called customer support and the lady- who was pleasant at first, but then quickly became apathetic- said that they would need to lock my account down for 25 days to investigage.. So pretty much the same story as everyone else.  This is such bullshit.  I don’t understand why one of the strongest gaming platforms doesn’t have better security or the sense to TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BETTER.. not treat us like criminals and lock us out.  I have to call back with my serial number and I’m going to be as pushy as I can and ask to speak with supervisors, etc, as well as address the concerns of this post- how did they hack my account, do they have my credit card information, et cetera.  Also I don’t understand why they have to kick us out of their accounts, rather than letting us play and maybe disabling purchases during the investigation process.  So angry.

You would think that they request you to log in to there servers and sign up to there systems they would make them secure.

Reply         In the Same Boat  says:     January 3, 2012 at 11:49 am      Just happened to me New Year’s Eve Day … I received some MS Pre-Paid point cards for xmas … One 4000 MS Pts and two 1600 Pts …. I decided to add them to my account so that I could get some DLC and maybe rent a movie or two.  Went to bed with 7200 pts in my account …  Got up the next morning, turned on  my xbox and one of the login messages came up saying “This account was previously logged into another console” …. Not knowing the gravity of what this really meant, I just dismissed it.  Went online, played some multiplayer games … That night I was settling in and thought of renting a movie … Made my movie selection, went to purchase and saw that I only had 20 MS pts left in my account.  WTF!!!!  I looked at my download history on my console … But the only things that showed up are DLC and movies that I downloaded myself.  So I logged into XBL Website and looked at the account history … And there is was Microsoft Gold Jumbo Pack.  They have also associated another email address with my Live Account.  Luckily, the credit card that I associated with my XBL account only has a $200 credit limit … So they can’t get much from me.  Looked at my Achievements … FIFA 12 is showing up with 2 achievements unlocked.  I immediately called Microsoft and told them about the breach … I can’t stand sports games, I personally would never play one or pick one up .. So it’s pretty ironic that it’s a sports game that has created this security loop hole.  The MS Support agent went on to tell me that EA Games is running some type of in game promotion for the FIFA game that allows players to win MS Points and then redeem them for cash in the form of a check that is mailed to them.  Isn’t that just awesome.  Way to go EA!!  Thanks to your unsecure “promotion” hundreds if not thousands of us are getting hacked around the globe.  After reading everything below I don’t know why we someone hasn’t started a class action lawsuit against Microsoft or EA games at this point.  This is Theft and Identity Fraud.  So I’m in the same boat … Account is locked out for the next 3-6 weeks .. No Netflix or Hulu streaming … No playing online with my friends enjoying the many games that I got for Christmas.   I know it could be much much worse after reading that some people were hit up for 10k or more MS point purchases.  I think that I will be removing my credit card from my XBL account and associating my PayPal account going forward.  At least with PayPal, I have it set up that in order to log into PayPal a security code is sent to my cell phone and that code must be inputting within 3 minutes of receipt.  So I feel that this account is at least locked down and secure.  I truly feel for anyone that has had this happen to them .. It feels like a complete violation and if Microsoft or EA would only fess up or at the very least close down this security loop hole it might make us feel better about using their offered services.

Reply         Egg Head  says:     January 8, 2012 at 12:12 am      Just happened to me. What a joke. My 360 hadn’t left my closet for nearly a year, and one day I decided to hop on and try out some new games. The next day, well, same story as the rest of you, and now I’m locked out of my own account while they perform their overstated, month long “investigation” that anyone with the access could do in a matter of minutes. A month? Are these people serious?  Why the lock out at all? Why don’t they just temporarily remove our payment plans and remaining MS points so we can continue using our account without worrying about money being lost if it’s broken into again? But of course not, that would actually make sense and be customer friendly. Microsoft obviously wants us to have to decide between losing a sum of money ($90 in my case) or being locked from what we thought was our property for up to 2 months.  It makes me ill that these crooks, and sadly I’m referring to Microsoft and not the “hackers”, get away with this crap.

After cursing my Internet and logging back in I got the “previously logged into another xbox” message.  I immediately knew I was being hacked.  As I went to pick up my laptop to Chang passwords, my girlfriends account logged in and her account was on my console, she didn’t own one.  Called just to make sure.  So I logged her in and changed her password and as I was doing that , my gt logged out.  I quickly logged in and same “other console” message.   I quickly changed my password aswell.   Luckily I still had my 2000 mp and kept force logging this guy off before he could spend my point and mess up my account.  Now I have to wait for tomorrow and call in, and I’m totally looking forward to having my account locked.   It better be back by mass effect 3 and raccoon city.   I don’t see how my account which gets logged in here in Los Angeles, CA one minute and the get logged in the UK doesn’t raise a red flag over at Microsoft. My heart goes out to those of you who lost money and have lost accounts and spent time waiting for Microsoft to “figure out” what happened.  If for some odd reason I end up losing my account, xbox will lose a long and faithful customer for good.   Reply         Anon  says:     January 15, 2012 at 9:26 pm      I was “FIFA” hacked.

I got hacked by some poor dope who played FIFA12 which i don’t even have, and Microsoft did barely anything to help me. They bought $20 of add ons and gave me 2 achievements. It happened with my friend too who got hacked by someone who had FIFA and they lost like $300   Reply         Domnu14  says:     March 1, 2012 at 9:39 pm      someone hacked into my girlfriends account and spent almost all of her xbox points that she had been saving.  it sucks because we thought that theses memberships were very secure. We’re just happy that we didn’t have a credit card or paypal attached to the account…. thanks xbox for keeping our accounts safe.

GrannySmith1 Jul 11, 2013, 6:27 PM  If you've played xbox live or PSN before, and especially the call of duty series, you'll get the occasional pissed off player who gets mad at you and threatens to "hack" you and find your IP address. I'm sure that 99.99% of these claims are just complete BS and 99% of COD players don't know how to hack, but is there a legitimate chance that you can get hacked over xbox live or PSN by someone who actually knows how to hack? How do they do this and what are measures you can take to prevent this from happening to you? Most of the time, people will threaten to find my IP address and find out where I live, but again I find this to be complete BS. First off, how important is your IP address? Does it really show where you live, or is this just a misunderstanding?        3 answers   Last reply  Jul 13, 2013    Best Answer  Jul 11, 2013    More about  important address           bob1033 Jul 11, 2013, 6:52 PM  Haha, you probably encountered some 13 year old punk that thinks finding the school wifi password is 'hacking'. I've know a thing or two about pen testing (hacking into a system for legit reasons) and you can rest assured that no one can really hack you with JUST an ip address. An ip address does show your relative location though, but the error of margin is AT LEAST 15 miles, so they wouldn't be able to find you, maybe just the city you leave in.         Best answer     Tom Tancredi Jul 11, 2013, 7:03 PM  Okay this is both a BS and a truism at the sametime and let me explain a bit. Think of IPs like telephone numbers, there is only *1* number like that anywhere,  (especially as people have cell phones thus can be anywhere) so saying I will find out your telephone number and I can track you down personally to where you are who you are etc. is not normally true (BS). Just like you ABSOLUTELY have to have a telephone number assigned to the phone before you can call another telephone's number, the same with IPs. You need one to make the connection to the target end, to 'call' tomshardware and 'order' the website. Now here is where the tricky part you see hollywood really make more BS about, when you connect your network (not your computer!) from your home router to a ISP, you are 1 of hundred of thousands of its customers, so your given a 'random' IP from a pool for your state, county, area of town, that gets used by your ISP for that area. So if someone worked INSIDE the ISP, they could 'track' you by that IP to that 'area' and monitor for your connection, or have it recorded already to track back for resolving issues (HEY my internet is slow!). That is the Big Brother Government image coming to hunt you down you see, but it is still a possibility (Court Orders, committing a actual crime, etc.). Now just as your phone may be AT&T, the person your calling is MCI, how does AT&T connect to MCI? Much less two different phone of different customers in different locations 100% of the time reliably. Well that is the same question about the Internet (replace phone with computer). Basically a spiders web of connections and interconnections were made by Communications companies, they then were forced to play nice by legal / government enforcement, so they share these resources and interconnect them. The 'path' between San Franscisco to Miami isn't straight SE though, it actually could go South then East then North then hop back West before run across to the NE then south again for THAT SINGLE connection. The next time the person tries it could take a different route, based on traffic, outages, etc. So 'tracking' backwards isn't really going to happen as you can see, because you have to be able to access all the connecting points, different ISP providers, etc. to track the connection.         Can't find your answer ? Ask !    Get the answer         manofchalk Jul 13, 2013, 5:27 AM  Your IP address can determine your general location, but as mentioned above it would only be accurate to a couple of miles at most. As for any person you meet on Xbox Live's ability to hack into your home network, provided you don't tell them any information yourself or do anything they tell you, they cant. They aren't hosting the server your connecting too, so they cant track the IP addresses of each player. If their games console is hosting it, they wouldn't be able to look at that list anyway. If they did manage to get your IP address, the most they could do is send a ton of traffic to your IP address which hopefully would consume all your internet bandwidth, effectively cutting you off from the Internet. This is basically what happens when hacker groups like Anonymous decide they want to take down a website. However I doubt that will happen, an attack like that would require a large network of computers to all hammer your IP at once, something that a single hacker/script kiddy is unlikely to have available. As for them getting into the network, its not going to happen unless you let them in. Quite simply the weakest link in any network security is the human element, the chances of a person allowing a virus into a network is far higher than one managing to sneak/bust its way through your firewall. Look up Kevin Mitnick, one of the most successful hackers in the world and his main way of getting in was simply asking people to let him in. This also backs up the point Tom was making about Hollywood, when he was eventually caught, the judge had no idea of how hacking worked and denied him access to a phone in prison so that he couldn't start a nuclear war by whistling notes into the phone .
