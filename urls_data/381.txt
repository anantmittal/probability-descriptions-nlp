         Birthday problem   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   For yearly variation in mortality rates, see birthday effect . For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

Posted on June 29, 2015  by  Sally Rockey     A Look at the Latest Success, Award and Funding Rates…and More  We frequently talk about the different ways of analyzing NIH funding. Let’s revisit this topic so I can provide you with the latest numbers. As a reminder,  • Success rate describes the likelihood of a project or an idea getting funded, rather than of the success of the individual application submission.   • Award rate describes the chance of an individual application being funded and is the number that more closely reflects institute and center paylines (which can vary significantly from one institute or center to another).  • Funding rate reflects the number of investigators who seek and obtain funding. Each principal investigator (PI)* is counted once, whether they submit one or more applications or receive one or more awards in a fiscal year.  Now let’s look at the latest data for NIH as a whole.  The chart below shows modest upward trends for fiscal year (FY) 2014 compared to 2013.  NIH received 51,073 research project grant (RPG) applications, out of which we funded 9,241, resulting in a success rate of 18.1 percent .  When we look at award rate, which accounts for resubmissions that came in during the same fiscal year, the application count increases to 54,519 resulting in an award rate of 17.0 percent in 2014. And if we look specifically at numbers of PIs, we see that in FY 2014 we funded 9,986 PIs out of 39,809 total investigator applicants for a funding rate of 25.1 percent .   Not surprisingly, we see that since the end of the doubling of the NIH budget in 2003, success, award, and funding rates have dropped.  But despite the challenging times, as you can see from the graph below, the number of PIs supported by competing and noncompeting grants per year has increased considerably since 1980—from over 15,000 to slightly over 27,000—closely tracking the pattern of the overall NIH budget.    The number of investigators rose to an all-time high in FY 2012, after which it fell, likely related to the sequestration that significantly reduced NIH’s budget.  While NIH funding levels were partially restored in FY 2014, the number of PIs remained at 2013 levels.   So what are the take-away messages? Success, award, and funding rates track closely to the NIH budget.  And clearly, the NIH budget is not keeping pace with demand; as a result, the success, award, and funding rates are at historically low levels. However, more applications are being submitted and more PIs are being supported now compared to 15 years ago.  I know many of you like to data dive, so we have made these files available to you on RePORT . We will continue to monitor these rates, and the impact our policy changes have on these numbers.  0 0 0 0   Related    This entry was posted in blog , Rock Talk and tagged Award rate , Funding data , funding rate , Success Rate by Sally Rockey .

As a result, everybody needs to submit more grants to subsist. Plus of course, with paylines at 9% for certain institutes, getting a grant funded has become an exercise of throwing darts until something hits the target.    Reply ↓         CD1 on July 1, 2015 at 10:10 pm  said:    Further, it converts well-trained researchers to full-time (or overtime) grant writers, having less experienced people do all important experiments.    Reply ↓           John on July 1, 2015 at 8:16 pm  said:    Of course, awards made through the nebulous select pay process raise the success rate. Care to recalculate the numbers based on awards made solely by peer review and not by the whim of an administrator?    Reply ↓         Laura on July 3, 2015 at 10:13 am  said:    You forgot to add an administrator who is a failed scientist. Sorry, but how is it that POs, who have NEVER held funding, published few papers and rarely (if ever) held faculty posts, are fit to make decisions about funding that don’t align with study section scoring. The NIH continually moves the bar to force greater transparency on the part of its scientist (new biosketch, PMCID etc) but yet the route to funding becomes more obscure and subjective each year.    Reply ↓           Ax on July 1, 2015 at 8:17 pm  said:    Agree with CD0, my places are well below 10% at times in the last 5 years.  Are SBIRs the reason for this mean funding rate?  Can we get a scatter plot to explain the disparity that seems to exist?    Reply ↓         David Kass on July 1, 2015 at 8:20 pm  said:    What I would like someone to explain is the following.   As a member of a standing NIH study section, I know that we are funding at close to the 10% rate.   I also know that this applies to all the grants we are asked to review – so both original and revised submissions.  I know that most other institutes are funding at similar rates to ours, but to come up with an average of 17% as posted by Sally, some of them must be funding at rates >30% of all their applications.  Is that correct?  Which institutes and/or grant opportunities.  Are we including early stage fellowship grants?  What gives?

There are simply far more people and more researchers in the US than 15 years ago. The percent of the GDP and of the federal budget going to research has declined significantly in recent years.    Reply ↓         JSmith on July 1, 2015 at 10:04 pm  said:    The denominator of success and award rates is “applications reviewed.” Some prior NIH publications have tallied only applications discussed at review, rather than those submitted for review (discussed + not discussed). The difference between the two methods would be roughly two-fold. Which is used here?

I am at the point of my career when I should be at peak productivity, but here I am at 10 pm with less than 5% of my real effort hours (~160% FTE!) integrated over time actually devoted to research.  I am filing noncompetes, writing new grants, applying to dozens of private foundations to fill in the gap that NIH cuts create, complying with onerous animal welfare regulations, devoting lab meetings to RCR rather than more urgent and interesting matters, trying to find the g..d… PMCID numbers for recent papers, reformatting my biosketch, patching together equipment with paperclips and rubber bands because I can’t afford service contracts, AND serving on a study section.  On top of that, the brightest students and fellows see how little time I get to do what I actually love, and conclude (very reasonably) that they don’t want to follow my path.  The not-so-bright end up in our grad program where I have to spend hours convincing each one that they should welcome constructive criticism, not cry about it.  It is actually very depressing to think about what I could be doing just a few steps away in my lab, and what I am forced to do instead in this tiny office at this late hour.  I wish NIH would do SOMETHING once in a while that decreased the non-research tasks of my day, but nooooo – tomorrow morning I have to hike across campus to personally attend NIH-OAW mandated training in how to kill a mouse by cervical dislocation (what do they suppose we’ve been doing for the past 30 years, drop-kicking them against the wall ?).  I’d like to extract something from the rodent at OAW who created a rule that I have to do that.    Reply ↓         DSK on July 2, 2015 at 10:59 am  said:    I agree completely – I spend a huge amount of time doing all of the above plus teaching (this is academia, after all), peer-reviewing manuscripts, preparing modified manuscripts for publication (it’s harded than ever to get something published, yet study sections still score ‘productivity’ by directly comparing PI’s without recognition of different levels of financial support from multiple sources).    Reply ↓         Bert Singlestone on July 2, 2015 at 12:18 pm  said:    Actually, I rather like teaching, and neither my university nor NIH requires me to do it, so I didn’t include it on my list of complaints.  However, I am required to support 80% of my salary through grants.   Now here’s where I have a major complaint: NIH-mandated RCR training.  Despite everything we are supposed to teach about integrity and the honest reporting of data, I might specify that any given grant supports 25% or maybe 40% of my salary, but what a lie!!  Any individual project probably gets no more than 2% of my effort.  The only way a grant-funded project could ever get 25-40% of my effort is if you count all the time spent to GET the grant in the first place!!!  Yeah – so that’s what I teach in our RCR sessions – what a lie we are all forced to live.

It’s nice that the NIH wants us to feel encouraged – but the fact remains that by any of the three measures, rates are the lowest they have been in *25 years*. Unless Congress increases the NIH budget, or the NIH realigns priorities to fund more individual R grants and fewer “big science” big-ticket items, it will be hard to feel encouraged.

In addition, to be fair no PI should hold more than 2 RO1 at a time.  Lots of PI just waste federal funding when they have many R01s.  Special tax reforms should be made to ask vendors to supply research items to University at a discounted rate. There is really no need to waste limited funding on program if the University does not cover the salary of the PI and the coworkers.  The indirect cost spending  details should be provided and strict auditing should be done on the how indirect cost was spend at each University.  New auditors needs to be hired to performed peiodic check on indirect cost spending.  Accountability to the federal budget is the key to maintain this fragile NIH budget.  Government simply do not want to spend more money at this point on research and this is the best option is to learn innovative ways to save NIH research money.  For new investigators there should be signficant linency to build their career in science.

However, the target is not defined, so getting funded is more like throwing a dice in the dark and hoping that somebody will see the number 6. Can a progressive country like the USA afford to throw darts or dices? We are wasting billion of dollars to rewrite grants, to do experiments for preliminary results which may not be pursued, to pay administrators to generate budget and submit grants, and all these at the expense of doing a good research. No surprise more and more published work is retracted. I am afraid USA is sinking.    Reply ↓         Paul Brookes on July 2, 2015 at 8:27 am  said:    Before the first graph, this paragraph contains some rather interesting sub-text… NIH received 51,073 research project grant (RPG) applications, out of which we funded 9,241. And if we look specifically at PIs, we funded 9,986 PIs out of 39,809 total investigator applicants  One possible take home from this, is that 9,986 PIs got 9,241 grants, which hints strongly that mutli-PI grants made up a reasonable chunk of the funded proposals.  The other way to parse this, is to say 39,809 investigators applied for 51,073 awards, so the PI/grant ratio on the application end was 0.779.  On the funding end however, the PI/grant ratio was (9,986/9,241) = 1.081. This suggests that a much greater percentage of multi-PI proposals were funded.  If NIH has separate numbers for Success/Award/Funding on multi-PI vs.single-PI proposals, that would make for an interesting comparison.

Look at the period from 1993 to 2003. NIH funding more than doubled, but award, success, and funding rates were nearly unchanged, perhaps even down at these points. Furthermore the number of investigators increased by, perhaps, 50%, so it is not a matter of disproportionately more investigators diluting the pool of resources. I don’t know what the demands on the NIH were during this period, but the data provided in this article do not seem, to support the “take-away message”.    Reply ↓         Yasmin Wadia, MD on July 2, 2015 at 11:07 am  said:    Does NIH have any data on what percentage of research funded actually gets commercialized and used for patient care?  A study done internally at Rice University found that it is less than 1%.  Could the reason for this be that NIH is allocating 2.5% of its budget for commercialization efforts via the SBIR and STTR programs? Also the SBIR research is never funded to viability, leaving many companies in the ‘valley of death’ to die.  The NIH should reevaluate its mission, so that discoveries at universities have a robust pathway and funding to commercialization.  The funding for the SBIR -STTR program should match the funding for basic research. Otherwise a lot of great discoveries will never see the light of day.  <1% commercialization success rate is really a failure of the way business is done at the NIH and a very poor return on investment of our tax dollars.

Kirschner, Tillghman, Alberts et al.  The key parts of the document are the recommendations for addressing the current funding problems.  The article should be required reading for all administrators at private and public research universities and institutions, and it should be read by all NIH administrators from the top down, and graduate and post doctoral students in the biomedical science.

Reply ↓         Raj Gupta on July 2, 2015 at 3:26 pm  said:    A caveat, to the the “obvious caveat” is that more investigators are getting cut out (and only more recently) because the number of investigators applying has also increased, and that each investigator is now asking for more in one grant than they did back in 1999~2001, when the funding success rate peaked.  This intimates that a few select investigators are getting large chunks of money, and it may be a way that NIH is mitigating risk, which is unfortunate.    Reply ↓         les on July 3, 2015 at 10:55 am  said:    “more applications are being submitted and more PIs are being supported”  Thus statement is true but terribly misleading.  A simple calculation with these data  http://report.nih.gov/NIHDatabook/Charts/Default.aspx?sid=0&index=1&catId=13&chartId=124  Shows that there has been a 22.9% increase in awards since 1998 (e.g. from 7518 in 1998 to 9241 in 2014) BUT co-occurring with this increase is a 111% increase in applications (e.g. 24,151 in 1998 to 51073 in 2014). This translates to # of applications outpacing funding but almost 5 fold (4.86 to be exact). It is irrelevant more people are applying and there are more awards, the ratio in the rate of change in award to applications is far more informative about trend.

Regarding this discussion, it would be interesting if, instead of NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS,  the NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES receiving funds over the years were listed in a graph of this sort. My guess is that fewer and fewer universities are getting more and more of these funds.  The related problem with NIH funding is the huge amount of IDC paid to universities. It drains a LOT of money from the NIH budget, and at some universities, none of it goes back to the PI or department to support the research, which I thought was the idea in the first place.  University administrators always say it is for the lights/heat/water but those bills do not add up in anyway to 50%+ IDC rates that are typical these days. This is particularly the case if a few universities are getting most of the IDC funds.  Maybe these data  have been presented somewhere, but I haven’t run across them yet.   thanks…    Reply ↓         Sarah on July 13, 2015 at 5:02 pm  said:    I agree with most of what has been said above. However, I would like to encourage a call to action. Take the energy I feel pulsating through these posts and email your Senators and Representative about the importance of research funding! Better yet, request a meeting with them (they are home in August, make them work!) or their staff and explain the importance in person. Hearing it from an actual scientist is so motivating.  While there are some things the NIH can do to help here, most of the problem is lack of funding, and ‘we the people’ need to put the screws on our Congresspeople.    Reply ↓         Tina M.

So, here it is:  Here it is 2016 I and found this blog. I am the “poster woman”  for a good researcher who took time off her work for the sake of the wellbeing of her small children. This is a natural instinct, and should never interfere with a career. The field is unforgiving, and labeled me a “stay at home mom” for life. I have been criticized for this decision by other women not in my situation, and patronized by men. After seven years of producing high quality human beings, my best experiment by the way, I searched for opportunities only to find doors slam in my face. The best I could find were adjunct teaching position. Research overlooked that fact that I was well published, capable of writing grants, and had performed cutting edge molecular research that aided in the advancement cancer therapies. After all, I was a woman, a “stay at home mom.”  I continue to fight this fight. I am getting older, and now there are prospective employers who look me in the face and actually say, “Really, how long do you expect to stay here if you did get the job?” What?????? Is that sex discrimination? Is it age discrimination? I think it’s a little bit of both. This would not have been said to a man. Men would never have taken a hiatus to tend to their children. A man would have been hired regardless.  I have been searching for a full time position in research or academia going on ten years now. I am a fierce advocate for women in science, and when I get to speak to any of my female students during the adjunct teaching positions, I sit them down and give them the harsh truth. We have to fight every step of the way, and it should not be this way. Something needs to change. The old big boys need to step out of the way. There should be NIH grants set aside for people like me, grants only given to women who return to science after time spent assuring that their children are cared for and nurtured.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

Posted on June 29, 2015  by  Sally Rockey     A Look at the Latest Success, Award and Funding Rates…and More  We frequently talk about the different ways of analyzing NIH funding. Let’s revisit this topic so I can provide you with the latest numbers. As a reminder,  • Success rate describes the likelihood of a project or an idea getting funded, rather than of the success of the individual application submission.   • Award rate describes the chance of an individual application being funded and is the number that more closely reflects institute and center paylines (which can vary significantly from one institute or center to another).  • Funding rate reflects the number of investigators who seek and obtain funding. Each principal investigator (PI)* is counted once, whether they submit one or more applications or receive one or more awards in a fiscal year.  Now let’s look at the latest data for NIH as a whole.  The chart below shows modest upward trends for fiscal year (FY) 2014 compared to 2013.  NIH received 51,073 research project grant (RPG) applications, out of which we funded 9,241, resulting in a success rate of 18.1 percent .  When we look at award rate, which accounts for resubmissions that came in during the same fiscal year, the application count increases to 54,519 resulting in an award rate of 17.0 percent in 2014. And if we look specifically at numbers of PIs, we see that in FY 2014 we funded 9,986 PIs out of 39,809 total investigator applicants for a funding rate of 25.1 percent .   Not surprisingly, we see that since the end of the doubling of the NIH budget in 2003, success, award, and funding rates have dropped.  But despite the challenging times, as you can see from the graph below, the number of PIs supported by competing and noncompeting grants per year has increased considerably since 1980—from over 15,000 to slightly over 27,000—closely tracking the pattern of the overall NIH budget.    The number of investigators rose to an all-time high in FY 2012, after which it fell, likely related to the sequestration that significantly reduced NIH’s budget.  While NIH funding levels were partially restored in FY 2014, the number of PIs remained at 2013 levels.   So what are the take-away messages? Success, award, and funding rates track closely to the NIH budget.  And clearly, the NIH budget is not keeping pace with demand; as a result, the success, award, and funding rates are at historically low levels. However, more applications are being submitted and more PIs are being supported now compared to 15 years ago.  I know many of you like to data dive, so we have made these files available to you on RePORT . We will continue to monitor these rates, and the impact our policy changes have on these numbers.  0 0 0 0   Related    This entry was posted in blog , Rock Talk and tagged Award rate , Funding data , funding rate , Success Rate by Sally Rockey .

As a result, everybody needs to submit more grants to subsist. Plus of course, with paylines at 9% for certain institutes, getting a grant funded has become an exercise of throwing darts until something hits the target.    Reply ↓         CD1 on July 1, 2015 at 10:10 pm  said:    Further, it converts well-trained researchers to full-time (or overtime) grant writers, having less experienced people do all important experiments.    Reply ↓           John on July 1, 2015 at 8:16 pm  said:    Of course, awards made through the nebulous select pay process raise the success rate. Care to recalculate the numbers based on awards made solely by peer review and not by the whim of an administrator?    Reply ↓         Laura on July 3, 2015 at 10:13 am  said:    You forgot to add an administrator who is a failed scientist. Sorry, but how is it that POs, who have NEVER held funding, published few papers and rarely (if ever) held faculty posts, are fit to make decisions about funding that don’t align with study section scoring. The NIH continually moves the bar to force greater transparency on the part of its scientist (new biosketch, PMCID etc) but yet the route to funding becomes more obscure and subjective each year.    Reply ↓           Ax on July 1, 2015 at 8:17 pm  said:    Agree with CD0, my places are well below 10% at times in the last 5 years.  Are SBIRs the reason for this mean funding rate?  Can we get a scatter plot to explain the disparity that seems to exist?    Reply ↓         David Kass on July 1, 2015 at 8:20 pm  said:    What I would like someone to explain is the following.   As a member of a standing NIH study section, I know that we are funding at close to the 10% rate.   I also know that this applies to all the grants we are asked to review – so both original and revised submissions.  I know that most other institutes are funding at similar rates to ours, but to come up with an average of 17% as posted by Sally, some of them must be funding at rates >30% of all their applications.  Is that correct?  Which institutes and/or grant opportunities.  Are we including early stage fellowship grants?  What gives?

There are simply far more people and more researchers in the US than 15 years ago. The percent of the GDP and of the federal budget going to research has declined significantly in recent years.    Reply ↓         JSmith on July 1, 2015 at 10:04 pm  said:    The denominator of success and award rates is “applications reviewed.” Some prior NIH publications have tallied only applications discussed at review, rather than those submitted for review (discussed + not discussed). The difference between the two methods would be roughly two-fold. Which is used here?

I am at the point of my career when I should be at peak productivity, but here I am at 10 pm with less than 5% of my real effort hours (~160% FTE!) integrated over time actually devoted to research.  I am filing noncompetes, writing new grants, applying to dozens of private foundations to fill in the gap that NIH cuts create, complying with onerous animal welfare regulations, devoting lab meetings to RCR rather than more urgent and interesting matters, trying to find the g..d… PMCID numbers for recent papers, reformatting my biosketch, patching together equipment with paperclips and rubber bands because I can’t afford service contracts, AND serving on a study section.  On top of that, the brightest students and fellows see how little time I get to do what I actually love, and conclude (very reasonably) that they don’t want to follow my path.  The not-so-bright end up in our grad program where I have to spend hours convincing each one that they should welcome constructive criticism, not cry about it.  It is actually very depressing to think about what I could be doing just a few steps away in my lab, and what I am forced to do instead in this tiny office at this late hour.  I wish NIH would do SOMETHING once in a while that decreased the non-research tasks of my day, but nooooo – tomorrow morning I have to hike across campus to personally attend NIH-OAW mandated training in how to kill a mouse by cervical dislocation (what do they suppose we’ve been doing for the past 30 years, drop-kicking them against the wall ?).  I’d like to extract something from the rodent at OAW who created a rule that I have to do that.    Reply ↓         DSK on July 2, 2015 at 10:59 am  said:    I agree completely – I spend a huge amount of time doing all of the above plus teaching (this is academia, after all), peer-reviewing manuscripts, preparing modified manuscripts for publication (it’s harded than ever to get something published, yet study sections still score ‘productivity’ by directly comparing PI’s without recognition of different levels of financial support from multiple sources).    Reply ↓         Bert Singlestone on July 2, 2015 at 12:18 pm  said:    Actually, I rather like teaching, and neither my university nor NIH requires me to do it, so I didn’t include it on my list of complaints.  However, I am required to support 80% of my salary through grants.   Now here’s where I have a major complaint: NIH-mandated RCR training.  Despite everything we are supposed to teach about integrity and the honest reporting of data, I might specify that any given grant supports 25% or maybe 40% of my salary, but what a lie!!  Any individual project probably gets no more than 2% of my effort.  The only way a grant-funded project could ever get 25-40% of my effort is if you count all the time spent to GET the grant in the first place!!!  Yeah – so that’s what I teach in our RCR sessions – what a lie we are all forced to live.

It’s nice that the NIH wants us to feel encouraged – but the fact remains that by any of the three measures, rates are the lowest they have been in *25 years*. Unless Congress increases the NIH budget, or the NIH realigns priorities to fund more individual R grants and fewer “big science” big-ticket items, it will be hard to feel encouraged.

In addition, to be fair no PI should hold more than 2 RO1 at a time.  Lots of PI just waste federal funding when they have many R01s.  Special tax reforms should be made to ask vendors to supply research items to University at a discounted rate. There is really no need to waste limited funding on program if the University does not cover the salary of the PI and the coworkers.  The indirect cost spending  details should be provided and strict auditing should be done on the how indirect cost was spend at each University.  New auditors needs to be hired to performed peiodic check on indirect cost spending.  Accountability to the federal budget is the key to maintain this fragile NIH budget.  Government simply do not want to spend more money at this point on research and this is the best option is to learn innovative ways to save NIH research money.  For new investigators there should be signficant linency to build their career in science.

However, the target is not defined, so getting funded is more like throwing a dice in the dark and hoping that somebody will see the number 6. Can a progressive country like the USA afford to throw darts or dices? We are wasting billion of dollars to rewrite grants, to do experiments for preliminary results which may not be pursued, to pay administrators to generate budget and submit grants, and all these at the expense of doing a good research. No surprise more and more published work is retracted. I am afraid USA is sinking.    Reply ↓         Paul Brookes on July 2, 2015 at 8:27 am  said:    Before the first graph, this paragraph contains some rather interesting sub-text… NIH received 51,073 research project grant (RPG) applications, out of which we funded 9,241. And if we look specifically at PIs, we funded 9,986 PIs out of 39,809 total investigator applicants  One possible take home from this, is that 9,986 PIs got 9,241 grants, which hints strongly that mutli-PI grants made up a reasonable chunk of the funded proposals.  The other way to parse this, is to say 39,809 investigators applied for 51,073 awards, so the PI/grant ratio on the application end was 0.779.  On the funding end however, the PI/grant ratio was (9,986/9,241) = 1.081. This suggests that a much greater percentage of multi-PI proposals were funded.  If NIH has separate numbers for Success/Award/Funding on multi-PI vs.single-PI proposals, that would make for an interesting comparison.

Look at the period from 1993 to 2003. NIH funding more than doubled, but award, success, and funding rates were nearly unchanged, perhaps even down at these points. Furthermore the number of investigators increased by, perhaps, 50%, so it is not a matter of disproportionately more investigators diluting the pool of resources. I don’t know what the demands on the NIH were during this period, but the data provided in this article do not seem, to support the “take-away message”.    Reply ↓         Yasmin Wadia, MD on July 2, 2015 at 11:07 am  said:    Does NIH have any data on what percentage of research funded actually gets commercialized and used for patient care?  A study done internally at Rice University found that it is less than 1%.  Could the reason for this be that NIH is allocating 2.5% of its budget for commercialization efforts via the SBIR and STTR programs? Also the SBIR research is never funded to viability, leaving many companies in the ‘valley of death’ to die.  The NIH should reevaluate its mission, so that discoveries at universities have a robust pathway and funding to commercialization.  The funding for the SBIR -STTR program should match the funding for basic research. Otherwise a lot of great discoveries will never see the light of day.  <1% commercialization success rate is really a failure of the way business is done at the NIH and a very poor return on investment of our tax dollars.

Kirschner, Tillghman, Alberts et al.  The key parts of the document are the recommendations for addressing the current funding problems.  The article should be required reading for all administrators at private and public research universities and institutions, and it should be read by all NIH administrators from the top down, and graduate and post doctoral students in the biomedical science.

Reply ↓         Raj Gupta on July 2, 2015 at 3:26 pm  said:    A caveat, to the the “obvious caveat” is that more investigators are getting cut out (and only more recently) because the number of investigators applying has also increased, and that each investigator is now asking for more in one grant than they did back in 1999~2001, when the funding success rate peaked.  This intimates that a few select investigators are getting large chunks of money, and it may be a way that NIH is mitigating risk, which is unfortunate.    Reply ↓         les on July 3, 2015 at 10:55 am  said:    “more applications are being submitted and more PIs are being supported”  Thus statement is true but terribly misleading.  A simple calculation with these data  http://report.nih.gov/NIHDatabook/Charts/Default.aspx?sid=0&index=1&catId=13&chartId=124  Shows that there has been a 22.9% increase in awards since 1998 (e.g. from 7518 in 1998 to 9241 in 2014) BUT co-occurring with this increase is a 111% increase in applications (e.g. 24,151 in 1998 to 51073 in 2014). This translates to # of applications outpacing funding but almost 5 fold (4.86 to be exact). It is irrelevant more people are applying and there are more awards, the ratio in the rate of change in award to applications is far more informative about trend.

Regarding this discussion, it would be interesting if, instead of NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS,  the NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES receiving funds over the years were listed in a graph of this sort. My guess is that fewer and fewer universities are getting more and more of these funds.  The related problem with NIH funding is the huge amount of IDC paid to universities. It drains a LOT of money from the NIH budget, and at some universities, none of it goes back to the PI or department to support the research, which I thought was the idea in the first place.  University administrators always say it is for the lights/heat/water but those bills do not add up in anyway to 50%+ IDC rates that are typical these days. This is particularly the case if a few universities are getting most of the IDC funds.  Maybe these data  have been presented somewhere, but I haven’t run across them yet.   thanks…    Reply ↓         Sarah on July 13, 2015 at 5:02 pm  said:    I agree with most of what has been said above. However, I would like to encourage a call to action. Take the energy I feel pulsating through these posts and email your Senators and Representative about the importance of research funding! Better yet, request a meeting with them (they are home in August, make them work!) or their staff and explain the importance in person. Hearing it from an actual scientist is so motivating.  While there are some things the NIH can do to help here, most of the problem is lack of funding, and ‘we the people’ need to put the screws on our Congresspeople.    Reply ↓         Tina M.

So, here it is:  Here it is 2016 I and found this blog. I am the “poster woman”  for a good researcher who took time off her work for the sake of the wellbeing of her small children. This is a natural instinct, and should never interfere with a career. The field is unforgiving, and labeled me a “stay at home mom” for life. I have been criticized for this decision by other women not in my situation, and patronized by men. After seven years of producing high quality human beings, my best experiment by the way, I searched for opportunities only to find doors slam in my face. The best I could find were adjunct teaching position. Research overlooked that fact that I was well published, capable of writing grants, and had performed cutting edge molecular research that aided in the advancement cancer therapies. After all, I was a woman, a “stay at home mom.”  I continue to fight this fight. I am getting older, and now there are prospective employers who look me in the face and actually say, “Really, how long do you expect to stay here if you did get the job?” What?????? Is that sex discrimination? Is it age discrimination? I think it’s a little bit of both. This would not have been said to a man. Men would never have taken a hiatus to tend to their children. A man would have been hired regardless.  I have been searching for a full time position in research or academia going on ten years now. I am a fierce advocate for women in science, and when I get to speak to any of my female students during the adjunct teaching positions, I sit them down and give them the harsh truth. We have to fight every step of the way, and it should not be this way. Something needs to change. The old big boys need to step out of the way. There should be NIH grants set aside for people like me, grants only given to women who return to science after time spent assuring that their children are cared for and nurtured.
