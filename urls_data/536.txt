When things get intimate, what are the chances of getting pregnant... or even dying of a heart attack?

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

Our objective in this lesson is to get by that roadblock and demonstrate that what lies beyond is not really so bad. In fact, the road may be quite smooth once you understand probability and its usefulness for interpreting measurement data.  Probability is important because it helps us understand the chances of making a correct inference or decision on the basis of a limited amount of data. Data is often limited because of cost considerations, therefore, it is very important to interpret that data properly. For example, in evaluating the performance of a new laboratory method by analyzing 40 specimens on a new method and a comparison method, what is the probability, or chance, that the difference observed between methods represents a real measurement error and not just a figment of the noise in the data (random error, imprecision, or scatter). In laboratory quality control, where it is common to make only two or three measurements, what is the probability of detecting medically important errors when using a Levey-Jennings control chart with control limits set as the mean plus and minus 2 SD? What is the chance of a false rejection, i.e., an out-of-control signal even though the method is working properly?  You most likely have already been exposed to the topic of probability in earlier courses. You may have used probability in your genetics class to construct a Punnet square. You may have used probability theory in chemistry to predict the number of isomers for compounds containing asymmetric carbon groups.  Probability  Probability is a number from 0.00 to 1.00 that represents the chance that an event will occur. A probability of 1.00 means the event will always occur. A probability of 0.00 means the event will never occur. It's also common to talk about the chance of occurrence, which is commonly described by percentage figures between 0.0% and 100.0%.  Coin toss examples. What is the chance of tossing a coin and having it land heads up (H)? Mathematically, the chance of H or probability of H on one toss of one fair coin (that has one head and one tail) is equal to the number of heads (H) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (heads plus tails, or H + T): Pr(H) = H/(H+T) or ½ or 0.50. That's why it's fair to toss a coin to decide which football team gets to receive the ball and which has to kick off because both sides have an equal or 50% chance with a single coin toss.  Now, if we tossed five coins, what would be the most likely outcome? The answer is some combination of heads and tails. Intuitively, we know that the chance of tossing 5 coins and having all of them come up heads is quite small. That chance is the product of each of the single episodes: Pr(H) = (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = (1/2) 5 or (0.5) 5 or 0.03125. There is only a probability of about 0.03 or a 3% chance of getting heads on all 5 coins.          With a 5 coin toss, it's likely to see some combinations of heads and tails based on these possible outcomes: 5H+0T, 4H+1T, 3H+2T, 2H+3T, 1H+4T, and 0H+5T. All heads would occur 1/32 times or 0.03 probability, as shown at the right. Similarly, all tails would occur 0.03 of the time. Intuitively, the greatest possibility lies in having some mixture of H and T, possibly 2.5 heads - but that number is not a reality or a real number here. The expected frequency distribution can be seen in the top figure, which shows the distribution of possibilities as fractions of 32nds. The possibilities total to thirty-two 32nds or unity. The area under the curve is greatest between 2 and 4 heads, i.e., that is the highest probability or most likely outcome.  Probability distribution.  The frequency distribution for a 10 coin toss is shown in the second figure. Again, intuitively speaking, the greatest possibility is some mixture of H and T. With a 10 coin toss, achieving half heads or 5 is a real number, and the maximum probability is 0.50, as shown by the peak of the curve.  The distribution of a 20 coin toss is seen in the third figure. Again, the greatest area under the curve indicates some combination of heads and tails. When increasing the number of coins or events, the curves begin to look like normal distribution curves. As the number of events exceeds 30, the graph is considered to approximate a normal curve.        Statistical significance. The importance of this point is that a normal curve can often be used to assess the probability that an event or observed difference occurs by chance or by cause. In interpreting experimental results, it is common to use a probability of 0.05 as the cutoff between a chance occurrence and a cause occurrence. If the probability is greater than 0.05, i.e., Pr>0.05, the conclusion is that no difference exists. If Pr<0.05, then it is often concluded that a statistically significant difference has been observed; in short, that means there is a real difference due to some cause. That's why an understanding of probability is very useful for making inferences or decisions on the basis of experimental data. In the next section, we will see where that 0.05 comes from.   Standard Normal Distribution  The standard normal distribution or the unit normal distribution is a special normal curve made up of z-scores. Remember that a z-score is a standard score (also called the standard Gaussian variable) that is calculated by subtracting the mean from a value and dividing the result by the standard deviation: z = (value - mean)/standard deviation. For example, if the mean were 100 and the value were 110, then the difference between the mean and the value is 10. If the standard deviation were 5, then the difference of 10 has 2 SD's in it, thereby it is equal to 2z.  As discussed in lessons 1 and 2, this is one of those statistical forms that appears repeatedly in laboratory statistics. The formula is used to express the number of standard deviations in the difference between a value and the mean. The values for z range from zero to infinity. The figure shows that the most common z-scores are from 0.00 to 3.00. A z of 0.00 represents the mean and the range of z from +3.00 to - 3.00 encompasses almost all of the area of the distribution. In statistical language, this distribution can be described as N(0,1), which indicates distribution is normal (N) and has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  Area under a normal curve. The total area under the curve is equal to 1.00 or unity. Half of the area, or 0.50, is on either side of the mean. The area between the mean and -1.00 z is 0.34 and the area between the mean and +1.00 z is 0.34, therefore the mean +/- 1.00z represents 68% of the area under a normal curve. The area between -2.00 z and +2.00 z is 0.47 + 0.47 or approximately 95% of the area under the curve. Between -3.00 z and + 3.00 z is 0.49 + 0.49 or approximately 99% of the area under the curve. (These numbers should seem familiar to laboratorians.) Note also that the use of +/- 2.00 z encompasses 95% of the area or a .95 probability. The remaining 1% or 0.01 probability is left in the tails of the curve. Z-scores can also be listed as decimal fractions of the 1's, 2's, and 3's we have been using thus far. For example, you could have 1.40 z's. Here the decimal fraction is carried out to the hundreths place.  Table of areas under a normal curve. It is often convenient to use a table of areas under a standard normal curve to convert an observed z-score into the area or probability represented by that score. See the table of areas under a standard normal curve which shows the z-score in the left column and the corresponding area in the next column. In actuality, the area represented in the table is only one half of the normal curve, but since the normal curve is symmetrical, the other half can also be estimated from the same table and the 0.50 on the upper half plus the 0.50 in the lower half equals 1.00 or all of the distribution.  As an example use of the table, a z-score of 1.40 is listed as having an area of 0.4192. This indicates that 41.92% of the area is between the mean or center of the distribution and the z-score of 1.40. The area beyond that particular z-score to the tail end of the distribution would be the difference between 0.5000 and the value of 0.4192, or 0.0808 because the table represents one half or 0.5000 of the area of the distribution. Now let's look at the lower half of the distribution down to a z-score of -1.40 (i.e. a negative 1.40). This too represents an area of .4192. At +/- 1.40, you would have .4192 plus .4192 or .9394 of the are under the curve. Sometimes statisticians want to accumulate all of the negative z-score area (the left half of the curve) and add to that some of the postive z-score area. All of the negative area equals .5000 plus some of the positive area, here .4192, added together would give .9142.  Here is an example of how to use the table: to find the area for a z-score of 1.96, find the value of 1.9 in the leftmost column, then find the hundredth figure from the column heading for .06, and read the area below that column, e.g., 0.4750. The area from -1.96 to +1.96 would encompass 2*0.475 or 95% of the area under a normal curve, leaving 5% outside those limits or 5% in the tails. Note that we commonly think of a 95% range as the mean plus or minus 2z or 2 SD, but that's an approximation and the exact z-score should be 1.96.  At 3.00 z, the area under the curve is 0.4987, which leaves an area of approximately 0.0013 outside in the tail. The area from -3.00 to +3.00 encompasses 2*0.4987 or 99.74% of the area, leaving only 0.26% outside. This is why 3 SD control limits have a very low chance of false rejections compared to 2 SD limits.  z-score transformation formula. The concept of the standard normal distribution will become increasingly important because there are many useful applications. If the population mean, µ, and the population standard deviation, , of any normally distributed data are known, the z-scores can be computed through the use of the following z score transformation formula:  z = (X - µ)/s  Again the formula represents the value minus the mean all divided by the standard deviation. The formula defines the difference score (X - µ or X-Xbar or delta, as seen in earlier lessons), according to how many standard deviation units it represents.  Proficiency testing example. One useful application is in proficiency testing (PT), where a laboratory analyzes a series of samples to demonstrate that it can provide correct answers. The results from PT surveys often include z-scores. For example, a glucose test value on a proficiency testing sample is observed to be 275 mg/dl. Other laboratories that analyzed this same sample show a mean value of 260 and a standard deviation of 6.0 mg/dL. In comparison to these values, our laboratory's analysis has a z-score of +2.50, which means that less than 1% of other laboratories got a higher test result (observe that a z-score of +2.50 corresponds to an area of 0.4938, which leaves only 0.0062 or 0.62% of the area in the tail above 2.50). Said another way, there is only a very small chance that the 275 mg/dL glucose value belongs with the rest of the proficiency testing values. Said another way, there is only a 0.0228 probability, or a very small chance, that the 275 glucose really does belong with the other values. Most likely it represents a measurement error by the laboratory.  z-scores vs SDs. Because there is so much confusion concerning this topic, it's worthwhile to review the relation between z-score and standard deviations (SD). The lines between statistical definitions sometimes blur over time.  Remember that the mean and standard deviation are the first statistics that are calculated to describe the variation of measurements or distribution of results. The standard deviation is a term that has the same units as the measurement, therefore it can be used to describe the actual range of measurement results that might be expected.  A z-score can be calculated once the mean and standard deviation are available. The calculated z-score [z-score = (value - mean)/SD] describes where a value is located in the distribution, e.g., a z-score of 0 is at the mean of the distribution and a z-score of 2.0 or beyond is in the tails of the distribution. Notice that SD is in the denominator of the z-score formula, so SD's and z's are not really the same. The z-score is a ratio and therefore is unitless, whereas the SD is expressed in concentration units.  But, we tend to think in terms of ±2SD as if they were ±2z. We use the SD like a z-score by saying that, if a value falls out of the curve >±2SD, then it is different from 95% of the rest of the curve (we probably should have been saying ±2z). When a value lies at >±2z's (SD's), then that value is outside of the 95% area under the curve. So 1.00 - 0.95 = 0.05. That value lies in the 0.05 area of the tails. We often use this probability of 0.05 as an indicator of statistical significance, i.e. when a value falls out >±2SD (or z's), then a statistically significant or real difference has been observed (with Pr < 0.05 that the value is a chance occurrence).  Relationship to t-distribution. In the above PT example, the population mean (µ) and the population standard deviation (s) were known quantities, i.e., the data from all laboratories participating in the proficiency testing survey were included in the calculations, thus the true mean and true standard deviation are known for the whole population. When the population mean and standard deviation are not known, which is a more typical situation, z-scores cannot be calculated. In fact, in most laboratory applications, µ and s are not known. There is, however, another family of distributions - the t-distributions - which can be used when the µ and s are approximated by Xbar and SD.  The t-distributions generally are said to have "heavier tails" as compared to the normal distribution. As the sample size gets larger and larger (N increases to about 30 or 40), these distributions begin to approximate the normal curve and can be used much like the unit normal curve because ±2t accumulates about 95% of the area under the curve. A t-value can be calculated much like a z-value, e.g., tcalc = (observed value - mean)/sXbar, where sXbar represents the standard error of the mean, which we learned about in lesson 5. If tcalc is greater than +/- 2, then a conclusion can be drawn about that particular value. A t-distribution can be used to help in making the decision that the means of two samples are far enough apart to be considered to be different, i.e., the difference is statistically significant, or close enough together to be considered the same, i.e., the difference is not statistically significant. When N is less than 30, it will be necessary to look up a critical t-value from a table.   Self-assessment questions   What is the probability of tossing three fair coins and getting all heads? What's the probability of getting three tails? What's the probability of getting some other combination of heads and tails?  What is a z-score?  For a z-score of 1.65, what is the area of the standard normal curve below that value? What is the area above that value?  How is the standard normal curve useful for data interpretation?  If an observed difference is greater than +/- 2 z, that difference is considered statistically significant at what probability?  Under what conditions do you use a t-distribution rather than a z-distribution?   About the author: Madelon F. Zady  Madelon F.

How Common is Oral Sex? Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex? Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex? Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex? What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex? What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?      Fast Facts  Many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be spread through oral sex.  Using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex can reduce the risk of giving or getting an STD.  Although oral sex may carry a lower risk for spreading HIV than other forms of sex, repeated unprotected exposures may increase risk of transmission.   What is Oral Sex?  Oral sex involves using the mouth, lips, or tongue to stimulate the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (anilingus) of a sex partner. The penis and testicles and the vagina and area around the vagina are also called the genitals or genital area.   How Common is Oral Sex?  Oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active adults. Oral sex can happen between heterosexual (straight) and same-sex (gay or lesbian) couples. More than 85% of sexually active adults aged 18-44 years reported having had oral sex at least once with a partner of the opposite sex. A separate survey conducted during 2007-2010 found that 33% of teenage girls and boys aged 15-17 years reported having had oral sex with a partner of the opposite sex.   Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex?  Many STDs, as well as other infections, can be spread through oral sex. Anyone exposed to an infected partner can get an STD in the mouth, throat, genitals, or rectum. The risk of getting an STD from oral sex, or spreading an STD to others through oral sex, depends on a number of things, including  The particular STD.  The sex acts practiced.  How common the STD is in the population to which the sex partners belong.  The number of specific sex acts performed.    In general:  It may be possible to get some STDs in the mouth or throat from giving oral sex to a partner with a genital or anal/rectal infection, particularly from giving oral sex to a partner with an infected penis.  It also may be possible to get certain STDs on the penis (and possibly the vagina, anus or rectum) from getting oral sex from a partner with a mouth or throat infection.  It’s possible to have an STD in more than one area at the same time, for example in the throat and the genitals.  Several STDs that may be transmitted by oral sex can then spread throughout the body of an infected person.  STDs can be spread to a sex partner even when the infected partner has no signs or symptoms.  If you are infected with an STD, you might not know it because many STDs may have no symptoms .     Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex?   Chlamydia Gonorrhea Syphilis Herpes HPV (human papillomavirus) HIV Trichomoniasis Chlamydia   Chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  chlamydia in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract may result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with chlamydia in the throat can result in getting chlamydia of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most chlamydia infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Many genital, urinary tract, or rectal chlamydia infections have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge   Treatment:  Chlamydia can be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with chlamydia should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with chlamydia should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners, particularly by performing oral sex on a male partner’s penis.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women : Might result in premature birth or low birth weight in babies.  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause chlamydia infection in the eyes or infection of the respiratory tract that can develop into pneumonia.   In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause a reaction (reactive arthritis) throughout the body that can lead to arthritis (joint pain), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and/or a rash on the soles of the feet or elsewhere.   Gonorrhea   Gonorrhea ( Neisseria gonorrhoeae )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  gonorrhea in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat may result in getting gonorrhea of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most gonorrhea infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Symptoms of genital, urinary tract, or rectal infection may include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge.   Treatment:  Infections in the throat are harder to cure than genital or rectal infections but can be treated with recommended antibiotics.  Genital and rectal infections can also be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with gonorrhea should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with gonorrhea should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Might spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to other sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women :  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause blindness, joint infection, or a life-threatening blood infection in the baby.  In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected, which is a serious and potentially life threatening condition.   Syphilis   Syphilis ( Treponema pallidum )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the genitals or anus can result in getting syphilis.  Getting oral sex from a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the lips or mouth, or in the throat, can result in getting syphilis.  Another important factor that affects risk of spreading syphilis is how long an infected partner has had syphilis.  Areas of initial infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genitals  Anus  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  One or more painless ulcers or sores on the lips, mouth, or throat; on the skin; or on or near the genitals or anus.  Rash on trunk, palms of hands, and/or soles of feet.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment:  Syphilis can be cured with the right medicine.  Sex partners of a person with syphilis should also be tested for infection, including some of the infected person’s past sex partners. Some of these partners should be treated even if their syphilis test results are negative.  If left untreated, syphilis:  Can be spread to others through contact with syphilis sores or rash.  In pregnant women: Can be spread to the baby during pregnancy.  Can cause stillbirth (a baby born dead).  Babies with untreated syphilis may become developmentally delayed, have seizures, or die.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection.  Can increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause damage to internal organs, blindness, muscle weakness, dementia, and even death.   Herpes   Herpes  (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum may result in getting herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat.

Areas of infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Anus  Rectum  Buttocks  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  Headache or fever (during initial infection).  Painful or itching sores at or near the area of infection.  Treatment:  There is no cure for a herpes, but antiviral medicine can shorten and help decrease symptoms of herpes outbreaks.  Daily antiviral medication can prevent or shorten herpes outbreaks.  Even with treatment, oral (lip, mouth and throat) infections:  Can be spread to others, including sex partners.  Even with treatment, genital area, buttock, anal, and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In pregnant women: May be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause brain damage, damage to internal organs, or even death of the baby.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Can increase risk of giving HIV to sex partners.

Some types of HPV can lead to vaginal or cervical cancer, anal, penile, head, and neck cancers.  Vaccine:   HPV vaccine protects against transmission of certain types of HPV. HPV vaccine is is recommended for 11- or 12-year-old girls, and for girls and women ages 13 through 26 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Girls as young as age 9 years may be vaccinated.  HPV vaccine is also recommended for 11- or 12-year-old boys, and for boys and men ages 13 through 21 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Boys as young as age 9 years and men through age 26 years may also be vaccinated.  Vaccination through age 26 years is recommended for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those who are living with HIV) who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses.   Treatment:  Warts in the mouth and throat: May disappear, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Surgery may be used to remove warts in the throat.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Genital and anal warts: May go away on their own, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Treatments include medicines applied to the warts, freezing the warts (cryotherapy), or surgery to remove the warts.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus: May need more clinical examination and testing ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Other procedures may be used, such as biopsy (taking a small sample of tissue) and/or removal of abnormal tissue, depending on age, pregnancy status, and test results.   Even with treatment, warts in the throat:  Might be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May have recurrences (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).  Even with treatment, genital and anal warts:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May return but will not develop into cancer.  Mouth and throat infections by several types of HPV that do not cause warts may develop into head or neck cancer.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina or anus:  Might develop into cancer. Although some women have abnormal Pap and/or HPV test results , few women get cervical cancer if they get the appropriate follow-up and treatment.  HIV   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex on the penis of a man with HIV can result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is lower than the risks from vaginal or anal sex.  Giving oral sex on the vagina of a woman with HIV may result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is thought to be very low.  Giving oral sex on the anus of a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be very low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be extremely low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Another important factor that affects risk of HIV spread is the virus level (i.e., viral load) in an infected partner’s blood and other body fluids at the time of the sexual encounter. A low HIV viral load in an infected partner does not completely eliminate the risk of spreading HIV from oral sex.   Areas of infection:  Iinfection of the immune system throughout the body.  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms for many years.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment  There is no cure for HIV, but antiviral and other medicines can help people with HIV live longer with a better quality of life.  Even with treatment, HIV infection:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Can increase the risk of getting certain infections and cancers.  Trichomoniasis   Trichomoniasis (infection with T. vaginalis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or a man with an infected penis might result in getting trichomoniasis of the throat. There are few reports of potential spread from oral sex.  Spread of trichomoniasis by other oral sex practices has not been reported.  Areas of initial infection  Vagina  Penis  Mouth/throat (possibly)  Initial signs and symptoms of infection  Infections of the genitals or urinary tract may have no symptoms, especially in men  Symptoms of genital or urinary tract infection can include: Discharge from vagina or penis.  Vaginal area redness.  Vaginal itching.  Burning feeling when urinating.   Treatment  Can be cured with right medicine.  The sex partners of people with trichomoniasis should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with trichomoniasis should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, genital or urinary infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.    In addition to the STDs above, other infections such as hepatitis A virus , Shigella and intestinal parasites ( amebiasis ) can be spread through giving oral sex on the anus.   Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex?  Many STDs can be spread through oral sex. However, it is difficult to compare the exact risks of getting specific STDs from specific types of sexual activity. This is partly because most people who have oral sex also have vaginal or anal sex. Also, few studies have looked at the risks of getting STDs other than HIV from giving oral sex on the vagina or anus, compared to giving oral sex on the penis.  Studies have shown that the risk of getting HIV from having oral sex with an infected partner (either giving or getting oral sex) is much lower than the risk of getting HIV from anal or vaginal sex with an infected partner. This may not be true for other STDs – in one study of gay men with syphilis, 1 out of 5 reported having only oral sex. Getting HIV from oral sex may be less likely than vaginal or anal sex, but it still carries risk. If you are having oral sex you should still protect yourself. Repeated unprotected oral sex exposure to HIV may represent a considerable risk for spread of HIV, as well as other STDs for which the risk of spread through oral sex has not been as well studied.   It is possible that getting certain STDs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, in the throat may not pose as great a threat to an infected person’s health as getting an STD in the genital area or rectum. Having these infections in the throat might increase the risk of getting HIV. Having gonorrhea in the throat also may lead to spread of the disease throughout the body. In addition: Having infections of chlamydia and gonorrhea in the throat may make it easier to spread these infections to others through oral sex. This is especially important for gonorrhea, since throat infections are harder to treat than urinary, genital or rectal infections.  Infections from certain STDs, such as syphilis and HIV, spread throughout the body. Therefore, infections that are acquired in the throat may lead to the same health problems as infections acquired in the genitals or rectum.  Mouth and throat infections by certain types of HPV may develop into oral or neck cancer.    What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex?  It is possible that certain factors may increase a person’s chances of getting HIV or other STDs during oral sex if exposed to an infected partner, such as:  Having poor oral health which can include tooth decay, gum disease or bleeding gums, and oral cancer.  Having sores in the mouth or on the genitals.  Being exposed to the “pre-cum” or “cum” (also known as pre-ejaculate or ejaculate) of an infected partner.  However, no scientific studies have been done to show whether or not these factors actually do increase the risk of getting HIV or STDs from oral sex.   What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?  You can lower your chances of giving or getting STDs during oral sex by using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex.  For oral sex on the penis: Cover the penis with a non-lubricated latex condom.  Use plastic (polyurethane) condoms if you or your partner is allergic to latex.   For oral sex on the vagina or anus: Use a dental dam.  Cut open a condom to make a square, and put it between the mouth and the partner’s vagina or anus.   The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting an STD:  Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results).  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.  It’s important to remember that many infected individuals may be unaware of their infection because STDs often have no symptoms and are unrecognized.  If you are sexually active, you should get tested regularly for STDs and HIV and talk to your partner(s) about STDs. If you think you might have an STD, stop having sex and visit your doctor or clinic to get tested. There are free and low-cost options for testing in your area. It is important that you talk openly with your health care provider about any activities that might put you at risk for an STD, including oral sex.

How Common is Oral Sex? Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex? Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex? Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex? What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex? What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?      Fast Facts  Many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be spread through oral sex.  Using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex can reduce the risk of giving or getting an STD.  Although oral sex may carry a lower risk for spreading HIV than other forms of sex, repeated unprotected exposures may increase risk of transmission.   What is Oral Sex?  Oral sex involves using the mouth, lips, or tongue to stimulate the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (anilingus) of a sex partner. The penis and testicles and the vagina and area around the vagina are also called the genitals or genital area.   How Common is Oral Sex?  Oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active adults. Oral sex can happen between heterosexual (straight) and same-sex (gay or lesbian) couples. More than 85% of sexually active adults aged 18-44 years reported having had oral sex at least once with a partner of the opposite sex. A separate survey conducted during 2007-2010 found that 33% of teenage girls and boys aged 15-17 years reported having had oral sex with a partner of the opposite sex.   Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex?  Many STDs, as well as other infections, can be spread through oral sex. Anyone exposed to an infected partner can get an STD in the mouth, throat, genitals, or rectum. The risk of getting an STD from oral sex, or spreading an STD to others through oral sex, depends on a number of things, including  The particular STD.  The sex acts practiced.  How common the STD is in the population to which the sex partners belong.  The number of specific sex acts performed.    In general:  It may be possible to get some STDs in the mouth or throat from giving oral sex to a partner with a genital or anal/rectal infection, particularly from giving oral sex to a partner with an infected penis.  It also may be possible to get certain STDs on the penis (and possibly the vagina, anus or rectum) from getting oral sex from a partner with a mouth or throat infection.  It’s possible to have an STD in more than one area at the same time, for example in the throat and the genitals.  Several STDs that may be transmitted by oral sex can then spread throughout the body of an infected person.  STDs can be spread to a sex partner even when the infected partner has no signs or symptoms.  If you are infected with an STD, you might not know it because many STDs may have no symptoms .     Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex?   Chlamydia Gonorrhea Syphilis Herpes HPV (human papillomavirus) HIV Trichomoniasis Chlamydia   Chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  chlamydia in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract may result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with chlamydia in the throat can result in getting chlamydia of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most chlamydia infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Many genital, urinary tract, or rectal chlamydia infections have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge   Treatment:  Chlamydia can be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with chlamydia should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with chlamydia should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners, particularly by performing oral sex on a male partner’s penis.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women : Might result in premature birth or low birth weight in babies.  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause chlamydia infection in the eyes or infection of the respiratory tract that can develop into pneumonia.   In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause a reaction (reactive arthritis) throughout the body that can lead to arthritis (joint pain), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and/or a rash on the soles of the feet or elsewhere.   Gonorrhea   Gonorrhea ( Neisseria gonorrhoeae )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  gonorrhea in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat may result in getting gonorrhea of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most gonorrhea infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Symptoms of genital, urinary tract, or rectal infection may include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge.   Treatment:  Infections in the throat are harder to cure than genital or rectal infections but can be treated with recommended antibiotics.  Genital and rectal infections can also be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with gonorrhea should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with gonorrhea should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Might spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to other sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women :  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause blindness, joint infection, or a life-threatening blood infection in the baby.  In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected, which is a serious and potentially life threatening condition.   Syphilis   Syphilis ( Treponema pallidum )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the genitals or anus can result in getting syphilis.  Getting oral sex from a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the lips or mouth, or in the throat, can result in getting syphilis.  Another important factor that affects risk of spreading syphilis is how long an infected partner has had syphilis.  Areas of initial infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genitals  Anus  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  One or more painless ulcers or sores on the lips, mouth, or throat; on the skin; or on or near the genitals or anus.  Rash on trunk, palms of hands, and/or soles of feet.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment:  Syphilis can be cured with the right medicine.  Sex partners of a person with syphilis should also be tested for infection, including some of the infected person’s past sex partners. Some of these partners should be treated even if their syphilis test results are negative.  If left untreated, syphilis:  Can be spread to others through contact with syphilis sores or rash.  In pregnant women: Can be spread to the baby during pregnancy.  Can cause stillbirth (a baby born dead).  Babies with untreated syphilis may become developmentally delayed, have seizures, or die.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection.  Can increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause damage to internal organs, blindness, muscle weakness, dementia, and even death.   Herpes   Herpes  (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum may result in getting herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat.  Getting oral sex from a partner with herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat can result in getting herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum.  Areas of infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Anus  Rectum  Buttocks  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  Headache or fever (during initial infection).  Painful or itching sores at or near the area of infection.  Treatment:  There is no cure for a herpes, but antiviral medicine can shorten and help decrease symptoms of herpes outbreaks.  Daily antiviral medication can prevent or shorten herpes outbreaks.  Even with treatment, oral (lip, mouth and throat) infections:  Can be spread to others, including sex partners.  Even with treatment, genital area, buttock, anal, and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In pregnant women: May be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause brain damage, damage to internal organs, or even death of the baby.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Can increase risk of giving HIV to sex partners.   HPV (human papillomavirus)   HPV (human papillomavirus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an HPV-infected penis or genital area can result in getting HPV in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an HPV-infected vagina or genital area can result in getting HPV in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with HPV on the anus or in the rectum may result in getting HPV in the throat.*  Getting oral sex from a partner with HPV in the throat might result in getting HPV on the genital area, anus, or rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of infection:  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Vagina  Cervix  Anus  Rectum  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms.  Warts in the throat (laryngeal or respiratory papillomatosis): May cause changes in the voice, difficulty speaking, or shortness of breath.   Genital or anal warts.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus that can be found by clinical examination and tests ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Some types of HPV can lead to vaginal or cervical cancer, anal, penile, head, and neck cancers.  Vaccine:   HPV vaccine protects against transmission of certain types of HPV. HPV vaccine is is recommended for 11- or 12-year-old girls, and for girls and women ages 13 through 26 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Girls as young as age 9 years may be vaccinated.  HPV vaccine is also recommended for 11- or 12-year-old boys, and for boys and men ages 13 through 21 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Boys as young as age 9 years and men through age 26 years may also be vaccinated.  Vaccination through age 26 years is recommended for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those who are living with HIV) who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses.   Treatment:  Warts in the mouth and throat: May disappear, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Surgery may be used to remove warts in the throat.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Genital and anal warts: May go away on their own, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Treatments include medicines applied to the warts, freezing the warts (cryotherapy), or surgery to remove the warts.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus: May need more clinical examination and testing ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Other procedures may be used, such as biopsy (taking a small sample of tissue) and/or removal of abnormal tissue, depending on age, pregnancy status, and test results.   Even with treatment, warts in the throat:  Might be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May have recurrences (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).  Even with treatment, genital and anal warts:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May return but will not develop into cancer.  Mouth and throat infections by several types of HPV that do not cause warts may develop into head or neck cancer.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina or anus:  Might develop into cancer. Although some women have abnormal Pap and/or HPV test results , few women get cervical cancer if they get the appropriate follow-up and treatment.  HIV   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex on the penis of a man with HIV can result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is lower than the risks from vaginal or anal sex.  Giving oral sex on the vagina of a woman with HIV may result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is thought to be very low.  Giving oral sex on the anus of a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be very low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be extremely low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Another important factor that affects risk of HIV spread is the virus level (i.e., viral load) in an infected partner’s blood and other body fluids at the time of the sexual encounter. A low HIV viral load in an infected partner does not completely eliminate the risk of spreading HIV from oral sex.   Areas of infection:  Iinfection of the immune system throughout the body.  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms for many years.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment  There is no cure for HIV, but antiviral and other medicines can help people with HIV live longer with a better quality of life.  Even with treatment, HIV infection:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Can increase the risk of getting certain infections and cancers.  Trichomoniasis   Trichomoniasis (infection with T. vaginalis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or a man with an infected penis might result in getting trichomoniasis of the throat. There are few reports of potential spread from oral sex.  Spread of trichomoniasis by other oral sex practices has not been reported.  Areas of initial infection  Vagina  Penis  Mouth/throat (possibly)  Initial signs and symptoms of infection  Infections of the genitals or urinary tract may have no symptoms, especially in men  Symptoms of genital or urinary tract infection can include: Discharge from vagina or penis.  Vaginal area redness.  Vaginal itching.  Burning feeling when urinating.   Treatment  Can be cured with right medicine.  The sex partners of people with trichomoniasis should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with trichomoniasis should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, genital or urinary infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.    In addition to the STDs above, other infections such as hepatitis A virus , Shigella and intestinal parasites ( amebiasis ) can be spread through giving oral sex on the anus.   Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex?  Many STDs can be spread through oral sex. However, it is difficult to compare the exact risks of getting specific STDs from specific types of sexual activity. This is partly because most people who have oral sex also have vaginal or anal sex. Also, few studies have looked at the risks of getting STDs other than HIV from giving oral sex on the vagina or anus, compared to giving oral sex on the penis.  Studies have shown that the risk of getting HIV from having oral sex with an infected partner (either giving or getting oral sex) is much lower than the risk of getting HIV from anal or vaginal sex with an infected partner. This may not be true for other STDs – in one study of gay men with syphilis, 1 out of 5 reported having only oral sex. Getting HIV from oral sex may be less likely than vaginal or anal sex, but it still carries risk. If you are having oral sex you should still protect yourself. Repeated unprotected oral sex exposure to HIV may represent a considerable risk for spread of HIV, as well as other STDs for which the risk of spread through oral sex has not been as well studied.   It is possible that getting certain STDs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, in the throat may not pose as great a threat to an infected person’s health as getting an STD in the genital area or rectum. Having these infections in the throat might increase the risk of getting HIV. Having gonorrhea in the throat also may lead to spread of the disease throughout the body. In addition: Having infections of chlamydia and gonorrhea in the throat may make it easier to spread these infections to others through oral sex. This is especially important for gonorrhea, since throat infections are harder to treat than urinary, genital or rectal infections.  Infections from certain STDs, such as syphilis and HIV, spread throughout the body. Therefore, infections that are acquired in the throat may lead to the same health problems as infections acquired in the genitals or rectum.  Mouth and throat infections by certain types of HPV may develop into oral or neck cancer.    What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex?  It is possible that certain factors may increase a person’s chances of getting HIV or other STDs during oral sex if exposed to an infected partner, such as:  Having poor oral health which can include tooth decay, gum disease or bleeding gums, and oral cancer.  Having sores in the mouth or on the genitals.  Being exposed to the “pre-cum” or “cum” (also known as pre-ejaculate or ejaculate) of an infected partner.  However, no scientific studies have been done to show whether or not these factors actually do increase the risk of getting HIV or STDs from oral sex.   What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?  You can lower your chances of giving or getting STDs during oral sex by using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex.  For oral sex on the penis: Cover the penis with a non-lubricated latex condom.  Use plastic (polyurethane) condoms if you or your partner is allergic to latex.   For oral sex on the vagina or anus: Use a dental dam.  Cut open a condom to make a square, and put it between the mouth and the partner’s vagina or anus.   The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting an STD:  Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results).  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.  It’s important to remember that many infected individuals may be unaware of their infection because STDs often have no symptoms and are unrecognized.  If you are sexually active, you should get tested regularly for STDs and HIV and talk to your partner(s) about STDs. If you think you might have an STD, stop having sex and visit your doctor or clinic to get tested. There are free and low-cost options for testing in your area. It is important that you talk openly with your health care provider about any activities that might put you at risk for an STD, including oral sex.

Emma Cannon does not, she laughs, have all the answers but, having founded the Fertility Support Clinic in 2004, she has come to be relied upon for using a more natural approach to conceiving. With over 50,000 hours of clinical experience to her name and an average of 360 new clients each year, she has become something of a ‘baby whisperer.’  “One in 28 babies are born to women over 40 ,” Cannon, 49, explains, “but [we’re told] you only have a five percent chance of getting pregnant every month when you’re 40, so where do these statistics really come from? Science would have you believe our fertility falls of a cliff at 38 , but so many other factors come into play. We don’t all decline the same way at the same time.”  With a raft of older women, from 64-year-old Julia Peyton-Jones to Janet Jackson , 50, becoming mothers for the first time in recent months, and conception rates growing in the UK, there is more focus than ever on keeping the body healthy as it ages.                 64-year-old Julia-Peyton Jones recently announced the birth of her first child   Credit: Walpole Awards          I VF , for so long considered the only hope for women unable to fall pregnant naturally, has come under fire of late, with leading fertility expert Lord Robert Winston criticising clinics who insist on ‘unnecessary’ treatments for vulnerable couples hoping to conceive - particularly as women remain fertile until they are 45.  Cannon believes IVF isn’t the only answer for women wanting to fall pregnant, and that many could find their fertility better boosted through acupuncture , making simple lifestyle changes and, actually, just having more sex - all of which she details in her new book, Fertile. It offers a combination of practical advice on nourishing the body before starting to try for a baby or beginning IVF, and delicious recipes created with Cannon’s friend and nutritionist, Victoria Wells.  “I‘ve known patients go for IVF who aren’t regularly having sex and aren’t given advice on regular sex,” Cannon says. “But a lot of what I’m doing is about cultivating good health. Often people are prioritising everything but sex . They’ve created a joyless life for themselves and they’re doing endless yoga or furiously juicing and that isn’t working either. The more out of control we feel, the more out of control we can become with things like our diet.”                 "What I’m advocating isn’t perfect either, but my clinic works in a more integrated way. We aren’t ruling out medicine, we are supporting it”   Credit: Clara Molden          T he emotional fallout from trying and failing to pregnant is not, she adds, helped by the fact that we are living in a society in which “we are all so used to getting what we want, when we want it.” Many rely on IVF as a way to get pregnant when “we have been massively oversold [it]. The idea that it works and it works for everyone is nonsense.  “We are told that a truth exists in science and, when it doesn’t work in areas of fertility, people feel really left down. What I’m advocating isn’t perfect either, but my clinic works in a more integrated way. We aren’t ruling out medicine, we are supporting it.”  Cannon urges women to consider that “the older we get, the more important it is to address our lifestyle choices. The rejuvenating and protective aspects of our body reduce. During the time when the eggs are suspended in the ovaries they come under the influence of the ovarian environment and there is a small window there where we can potentially make an impact on the quality of the eggs.”       Advice | Types of fertility treatment        I s there a way we can actually change the quality of our own eggs? “This really is the holy grail of fertility,” she says. “The quality of the egg declines with age but this is an area of medicine that is looking to improve the end stage development of the egg.” And, she adds, there are simple steps that can be taken to help things along the way. “ Melatonin is the hormone secreted at night and it can be taken as supplement. Research suggests that higher levels of Melatonin found in the fluid surrounding the developing follicles produced larger follicles during IVF and neutralise free radicals (that can cause disease). Melatonin can be achieved by exposure to sunlight so walk to work in the morning if you can. And avoid light at the end of the day from computers and phones as these can deplete it.”  She also recommends acupuncture , which improves blood flow to the ovaries, regularly visiting your dentist (gum disease is associated with pre-term labour) and increasing your Vitamin D intake, which is said to make the uterus more receptive.                 Cannon also recommends acupuncture as a fertility treatment, which improves blood flow to the ovaries   Credit: Mike Kemp          N ot to be forgotten, however, is paying attention to one’s digestive system and that is where Fertile proves particularly helpful. It presents a natural approach to making one’s body as ready to conceive as possible with a heavy focus on the gut . Half of it is a culmination of scientific research and Cannon’s own years of experience, the other half is a wonderful array of recipes made using fertility-boosting foods such as good oils, fish and chicken broth. “You can have a great diet, but if you have a poor digestive system with inflammation, fermentation and poor gut function, the way everything functions in the pelvic cavity won’t be optimal.”  In an era of food fads and quick fixes, Cannon, who has two daughters aged 16 and 21, promotes a calmer and comparatively sensible approach to eating, continually emphasizing that every individual is different and everyone’s digestive systems are unique. “I don’t believe in Superfoods . All these terms that we attach to foods are actually really damaging. Just eat as near to nature as possible and cook as much as you can.”                 Cannon recommends eating a variety of fermented foods to boost fertility   Credit: Haarala Hamilton          A nd it’s not only what you eat, but how. Too many of us are eating too late in the day; “when we go to bed at night we’re meant to digest our day and not our dinner. Our lifestyle and health do not support fertility, particularly when we are waiting longer to get pregnant.”And speaking of nighttime, we need to get off our iPhones: “there is growing evidence that they affect our circadian rhythms ,” but, also, it means we’re having less sex and, as she firmly points out, “it takes two.”       Eat your way to fertility | The best foods to boost your chances of conception        “Twenty years ago, there was no word for wellness and people didn’t understand it. The medical profession has long been in denial about the impact of food on our lives. We need a conversation in the middle.” And for the many, many women now hoping for conception over the age of 40, IVF doesn’t have to be the only road. In the Eighties, Cannon muses, “so many of us drank a bottle of Chardonnay and ate a packet of Haribos in a cab on the way home and wondered why our ovaries are covered in cysts” but with leaps forward in our understanding of our bodies, eating one’s way to fertility may be the most productive route of all.                 Cooking and eating together is important for couples and their sex lives   Credit: Juice Images / Alamy Stock Photo          “It’s important to remember that the preparation of food itself is a bit like alchemy. It feels really self-healing and means couples are spending time together, off their phones, and far more likely to make love.” It sounds simple but, as Cannon’s clients know, it works.

The initial formulation of the question dates back to at least 1959, when Martin Gardner published one of the earliest variants of the paradox in Scientific American . Titled The Two Children Problem , he phrased the paradox as follows:   Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?  Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   Gardner initially gave the answers 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 , respectively, but later acknowledged that the second question was ambiguous. [3] Its answer could be 1 / 2 , depending on how you found out that one child was a boy. The ambiguity, depending on the exact wording and possible assumptions, was confirmed by Bar-Hillel and Falk, [4] and Nickerson. [5]  Other variants of this question, with varying degrees of ambiguity, have been popularized by Ask Marilyn in Parade Magazine , [6]  John Tierney of The New York Times , [7] and Leonard Mlodinow in Drunkard's Walk . [8] One scientific study showed that when identical information was conveyed, but with different partially ambiguous wordings that emphasized different points, that the percentage of MBA students who answered 1 / 2 changed from 85% to 39%. [2]  The paradox has frequently stimulated a great deal of controversy. [5] Many people argued strongly for both sides with a great deal of confidence, sometimes showing disdain for those who took the opposing view. The paradox stems from whether the problem setup is similar for the two questions. [2] [8] The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 . [2] This answer is intuitive if the question leads the reader to believe that there are two equally likely possibilities for the sex of the second child (i.e., boy and girl), [2] [9] and that the probability of these outcomes is absolute, not conditional . [10]  Biologically, according to studies of the human sex ratio , it is more likely for any one person to be born into the male sex than the female sex.

First, it is assumed that the space of all possible events can be easily enumerated, providing an extensional definition of outcomes: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. [11] This notation indicates that there are four possible combinations of children, labeling boys B and girls G, and using the first letter to represent the older child. Second, it is assumed that these outcomes are equally probable. [11] This implies the following model , a Bernoulli process with p = 1 / 2 :   Each child is either male or female.  Each child has the same chance of being male as of being female.  The sex of each child is independent of the sex of the other.   The mathematical outcome would be the same if it were phrased in terms of a coin toss .  First question [ edit ]        This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .  (February 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   Under the aforementioned assumptions, in this problem, a random family is selected. In this sample space, there are four equally probable events:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Only two of these possible events meet the criteria specified in the question (i.e., GG, GB). Since both of the two possibilities in the new sample space {GG, GB} are equally likely, and only one of the two, GG, includes two girls, the probability that the younger child is also a girl is 1 / 2 .  Second question [ edit ]   Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   This question is identical to question one, except that instead of specifying that the older child is a boy, it is specified that at least one of them is a boy. In response to reader criticism of the question posed in 1959, Gardner agreed that a precise formulation of the question is critical to getting different answers for question 1 and 2. Specifically, Gardner argued that a "failure to specify the randomizing procedure" could lead readers to interpret the question in two distinct ways:   From all families with two children, at least one of whom is a boy, a family is chosen at random. This would yield the answer of 1 / 3 .  From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified to be a boy. This would yield an answer of 1 / 2 . [4] [5]   Grinstead and Snell argue that the question is ambiguous in much the same way Gardner did. [12]  For example, if you see the children in the garden, you may see a boy. The other child may be hidden behind a tree. In this case, the statement is equivalent to the second (the child that you can see is a boy). The first statement does not match as one case is one boy, one girl. Then the girl may be visible. (The first statement says that it can be either.)  While it is certainly true that every possible Mr. Smith has at least one boy (i.e., the condition is necessary) it is not clear that every Mr. Smith with at least one boy is intended. That is, the problem statement does not say that having a boy is a sufficient condition for Mr. Smith to be identified as having a boy this way.  Commenting on Gardner's version of the problem, Bar-Hillel and Falk [4] note that "Mr. Smith, unlike the reader, is presumably aware of the sex of both of his children when making this statement", i.e. that 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' If it is further assumed that Mr. Smith would report this fact if it were true then the correct answer is 1 / 3 as Gardner intended.  Analysis of the ambiguity [ edit ]  If it is assumed that this information was obtained by looking at both children to see if there is at least one boy, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. Three of the four equally probable events for a two-child family in the sample space above meet the condition, as in this table:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Thus, if it is assumed that both children were considered while looking for a boy, the answer to question 2 is 1 / 3 . However, if the family was first selected and then a random, true statement was made about the gender of one child in that family, whether or not both were considered, the correct way to calculate the conditional probability is not to count all of the cases that include a child with that gender. Instead, one must consider only the probabilities where the statement will be made in each case. [12] So, if ALOB represents the event where the statement is "at least one boy", and ALOG represents the event where the statement is "at least one girl", then this table describes the sample space:      Older child  Younger child  P(this family)  P(ALOB given this family)  P(ALOG given this family)  P(ALOB and this family)  P(ALOG and this family)    Girl  Girl  1 / 4  0  1  0  1 / 4    Girl  Boy  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Girl  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Boy  1 / 4  1  0  1 / 4  0      So, if you are told that at least one is a boy when the fact is chosen randomly, the probability that both are boys is          P  (  A  L  O  B   a  n  d   B  B  )    P  (  A  L  O  B  )     =     1  4    0  +    1  8    +    1  8    +    1  4       =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {\frac {P(ALOB\;and\;BB)}{P(ALOB)}} ={\frac {\frac {1}{4}}{0+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The paradox occurs when it is not known how the statement "at least one is a boy" was generated. Either answer could be correct, based on what is assumed. [13]  However, the " 1 / 3 " answer is obtained only by assuming P(ALOB|BG) = P(ALOB|GB) =1, which implies P(ALOG|BG) = P(ALOG|GB) = 0, that is, the other child's sex is never mentioned although it is present. As Marks and Smith say, "This extreme assumption is never included in the presentation of the two-child problem, however, and is surely not what people have in mind when they present it." [13]  Modelling the generative process [ edit ]  Another way to analyse the ambiguity (for question 2) is by making explicit the generative process (all draws are independent).   The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  3      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{3}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Observe      c   1    =  B  ∨   c   2    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{1}=B\vee c_{2}=B}      The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  2      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{2}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw index     i    {\displaystyle i}   equiprobably from     {  1  ,  2  }    {\displaystyle \{1,2\}}    Observe      c   i    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{i}=B}       Bayesian analysis [ edit ]  Following classical probability arguments, we consider a large urn containing two children. We assume equal probability that either is a boy or a girl. The three discernible cases are thus: 1. both are girls (GG) — with probability P(GG) = 1 / 4 , 2. both are boys (BB) — with probability of P(BB) = 1 / 4 , and 3. one of each (G·B) — with probability of P(G·B) = 1 / 2 . These are the prior probabilities.  Now we add the additional assumption that "at least one is a boy" = B. Using Bayes' Theorem , we find        P  (  B  B  ∣  B  )   =   P  (  B  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  B  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    3  4    )     =    1  3     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B)} =\mathrm {P(B\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(B)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{3}}\,.}     where P(A|B) means "probability of A given B". P(B|BB) = probability of at least one boy given both are boys = 1. P(BB) = probability of both boys = 1 / 4 from the prior distribution. P(B) = probability of at least one being a boy, which includes cases BB and G·B = 1 / 4 + 1 / 2 = 3 / 4 .  Note that, although the natural assumption seems to be a probability of 1 / 2 , so the derived value of 1 / 3 seems low, the actual "normal" value for P(BB) is 1 / 4 , so the 1 / 3 is actually a bit higher .  The paradox arises because the second assumption is somewhat artificial, and when describing the problem in an actual setting things get a bit sticky. Just how do we know that "at least" one is a boy? One description of the problem states that we look into a window, see only one child and it is a boy. This sounds like the same assumption. However, this one is equivalent to "sampling" the distribution (i.e. removing one child from the urn, ascertaining that it is a boy, then replacing). Let's call the statement "the sample is a boy" proposition "b". Now we have:        P  (  B  B  ∣  b  )   =   P  (  b  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  b  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    1  2    )     =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid b)} =\mathrm {P(b\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(b)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The difference here is the P(b), which is just the probability of drawing a boy from all possible cases (i.e. without the "at least"), which is clearly 1 / 2 .  The Bayesian analysis generalizes easily to the case in which we relax the 50:50 population assumption. If we have no information about the populations then we assume a "flat prior", i.e. P(GG) = P(BB) = P(G·B) = 1 / 3 . In this case the "at least" assumption produces the result P(BB|B) = 1 / 2 , and the sampling assumption produces P(BB|b) = 2 / 3 , a result also derivable from the Rule of Succession .  Martingale analysis [ edit ]  Suppose you had wagered that Mr Smith had two boys, and received fair odds. You paid $1 and you will receive $4 if he has two boys. We think of your wager as investment that will increase in value as good news arrives. What evidence would make you happier about your investment? Learning that at least one child out of two is a boy, or learning that at least one child out of one is a boy?  The latter is a priori less likely, and therefore better news. That is why the two answers cannot be the same.  Now for the numbers. If we bet on one child and win, the value of your investment has doubled. It must double again to get to $4, so the odds are 1 in 2.  On the other hand if we learn that at least one of two children is a boy, our investment increases as if we had wagered on this question. Our $1 is now worth $ 1  1 / 3 . To get to $4 we still have to increase our wealth threefold. So the answer is 1 in 3.  Variants of the question [ edit ]  Following the popularization of the paradox by Gardner it has been presented and discussed in various forms. The first variant presented by Bar-Hillel & Falk [4] is worded as follows:   Mr. Smith is the father of two. We meet him walking along the street with a young boy whom he proudly introduces as his son. What is the probability that Mr. Smith's other child is also a boy?   Bar-Hillel & Falk use this variant to highlight the importance of considering the underlying assumptions. The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 and, when making the most natural assumptions, this is correct. However, someone may argue that "…before Mr. Smith identifies the boy as his son, we know only that he is either the father of two boys, BB, or of two girls, GG, or of one of each in either birth order, i.e., BG or GB. Assuming again independence and equiprobability, we begin with a probability of 1 / 4 that Smith is the father of two boys. Discovering that he has at least one boy rules out the event GG. Since the remaining three events were equiprobable, we obtain a probability of 1 / 3 for BB." [4]  The natural assumption is that Mr. Smith selected the child companion at random. If so, as combination BB has twice the probability of either BG or GB of having resulted in the boy walking companion (and combination GG has zero probability, ruling it out), the union of events BG and GB becomes equiprobable with event BB, and so the chance that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 2 . Bar-Hillel & Falk, however, suggest an alternative scenario. They imagine a culture in which boys are invariably chosen over girls as walking companions. In this case, the combinations of BB, BG and GB are assumed equally likely to have resulted in the boy walking companion, and thus the probability that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 3 .  In 1991, Marilyn vos Savant responded to a reader who asked her to answer a variant of the Boy or Girl paradox that included beagles. [6] In 1996, she published the question again in a different form. The 1991 and 1996 questions, respectively were phrased:   A shopkeeper says she has two new baby beagles to show you, but she doesn't know whether they're male, female, or a pair. You tell her that you want only a male, and she telephones the fellow who's giving them a bath. "Is at least one a male?" she asks him. "Yes!" she informs you with a smile. What is the probability that the other one is a male?  Say that a woman and a man (who are unrelated) each has two children. We know that at least one of the woman's children is a boy and that the man's oldest child is a boy. Can you explain why the chances that the woman has two boys do not equal the chances that the man has two boys?   With regard to the second formulation Vos Savant gave the classic answer that the chances that the woman has two boys are about 1 / 3 whereas the chances that the man has two boys are about 1 / 2 . In response to reader response that questioned her analysis vos Savant conducted a survey of readers with exactly two children, at least one of which is a boy. Of 17,946 responses, 35.9% reported two boys. [11]  Vos Savant's articles were discussed by Carlton and Stansfield [11] in a 2005 article in The American Statistician . The authors do not discuss the possible ambiguity in the question and conclude that her answer is correct from a mathematical perspective, given the assumptions that the likelihood of a child being a boy or girl is equal, and that the sex of the second child is independent of the first. With regard to her survey they say it "at least validates vos Savant's correct assertion that the “chances” posed in the original question, though similar-sounding, are different, and that the first probability is certainly nearer to 1 in 3 than to 1 in 2."  Carlton and Stansfield go on to discuss the common assumptions in the Boy or Girl paradox. They demonstrate that in reality male children are actually more likely than female children, and that the sex of the second child is not independent of the sex of the first. The authors conclude that, although the assumptions of the question run counter to observations, the paradox still has pedagogical value, since it "illustrates one of the more intriguing applications of conditional probability." [11] Of course, the actual probability values do not matter; the purpose of the paradox is to demonstrate seemingly contradictory logic, not actual birth rates.  Information about the child [ edit ]  Suppose we were told not only that Mr. Smith has two children, and one of them is a boy, but also that the boy was born on a Tuesday: does this change the previous analyses? Again, the answer depends on how this information was presented - what kind of selection process produced this knowledge.  Following the tradition of the problem, suppose that in the population of two-child families, the sex of the two children is independent of one another, equally likely boy or girl, and that the birth date of each child is independent of the other child. The chance of being born on any given day of the week is 1 / 7 .  From Bayes' Theorem that the probability of two boys, given that one boy was born on a Tuesday is given by:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )  =     P  (   B   T    ∣  B  B  )  ×  P  (  B  B  )    P  (   B   T    )        {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})={\frac {P(B_{T}\mid BB)\times P(BB)}{P(B_{T})}}} }     Assume that the probability of being born on a Tuesday is ε ( ε = 1 / 7 will be set after arriving at the general solution). The first term in the numerator is therefore the probability of at least one boy born on Tuesday, given that the family has two boys, or 1 − (1 − ε ) 2 (one minus the probability that neither boy is born on Tuesday). The second term in the numerator is simply 1 / 4 , the probability of having two boys. The denominator is trickier; the required probability is that of having at least one boy on Tuesday over the entire sample space (two-child families). Therefore there are 4 cases to evaluate: BB, BG, GB, GG. Each of these occurs with probability 1 / 4 . P(B T (GG)) is 0, there are no boys. P(B T (BG)) and P(B T (GB)) is ε , there is one and only one boy, thus he has ε chance of being born on Tuesday. P(B T (BB)) is ε + ε − ε 2 . It is the chance that one boy is born on Tuesday, plus the chance that the other boy is born on Tuesday, minus the chance that they both are (this term arises from the fact that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A)P(B), assuming that A and B are independent). Therefore, the full equation is:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =      (   1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2     )   ×    1  4      0  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4     (   ε  +  ε  −   ε   2     )      =     1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2      4  ε  −   ε   2         {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {\left(1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}\right)\times {\frac {1}{4}}}{0+{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\left(\varepsilon +\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}\right)}}={\frac {1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}}{4\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}}}}      For     ε  >  0    {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0}   , this reduces to      P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =     2  −  ε    4  −  ε       {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {2-\varepsilon }{4-\varepsilon }}}     If ε is now set to 1 / 7 , the probability becomes 13 / 27 , or about 0.48. In fact, as ε approaches 0, the total probability goes to 1 / 2 , which is the answer expected when one child is sampled (e.g. the oldest child is a boy) and is thus removed from the pool of possible children. In other words, as more and more details about the boy child are given (for instance: born on January 1), the chance that the other child is a girl approaches one half.  It seems that quite irrelevant information was introduced, yet the probability of the sex of the other child has changed dramatically from what it was before (the chance the other child was a girl was 2 / 3 , when it was not known that the boy was born on Tuesday).  However, is it really plausible that the family with at least one boy born on a Tuesday was produced by choosing just one of such families at random? It is much more easy to imagine the following scenario.   We know Mr. Smith has two children. We knock at his door and a boy comes and answers the door. We ask the boy on what day of the week he was born.   Assume that which of the two children answers the door is determined by chance. Then the procedure was ( 1 ) pick a two-child family at random from all two-child families ( 2 ) pick one of the two children at random, ( 3 ) see if it is a boy and ask on what day he was born. The chance the other child is a girl is 1 / 2 . This is a very different procedure from ( 1 ) picking a two-child family at random from all families with two children, at least one a boy, born on a Tuesday. The chance the family consists of a boy and a girl is 14 / 27 , about 0.52.  This variant of the boy and girl problem is discussed on many internet blogs and is the subject of a paper by Ruma Falk. [14] The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.  Psychological investigation [ edit ]  From the position of statistical analysis the relevant question is often ambiguous and as such there is no “correct” answer. However, this does not exhaust the boy or girl paradox for it is not necessarily the ambiguity that explains how the intuitive probability is derived. A survey such as vos Savant's suggests that the majority of people adopt an understanding of Gardner's problem that if they were consistent would lead them to the 1 / 3 probability answer but overwhelmingly people intuitively arrive at the 1 / 2 probability answer. Ambiguity notwithstanding, this makes the problem of interest to psychological researchers who seek to understand how humans estimate probability.  Fox & Levav (2004) used the problem (called the Mr. Smith problem , credited to Gardner, but not worded exactly the same as Gardner's version) to test theories of how people estimate conditional probabilities. [2] In this study, the paradox was posed to participants in two ways:   "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' Given this information, what is the probability that the other child is a boy?"  "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and it is not the case that they are both girls.' Given this information, what is the probability that both children are boys?"   The authors argue that the first formulation gives the reader the mistaken impression that there are two possible outcomes for the "other child", [2] whereas the second formulation gives the reader the impression that there are four possible outcomes, of which one has been rejected (resulting in 1 / 3 being the probability of both children being boys, as there are 3 remaining possible outcomes, only one of which is that both of the children are boys). The study found that 85% of participants answered 1 / 2 for the first formulation, while only 39% responded that way to the second formulation. The authors argued that the reason people respond differently to each question (along with other similar problems, such as the Monty Hall Problem and the Bertrand's box paradox ) is because of the use of naive heuristics that fail to properly define the number of possible outcomes.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

Our objective in this lesson is to get by that roadblock and demonstrate that what lies beyond is not really so bad. In fact, the road may be quite smooth once you understand probability and its usefulness for interpreting measurement data.  Probability is important because it helps us understand the chances of making a correct inference or decision on the basis of a limited amount of data. Data is often limited because of cost considerations, therefore, it is very important to interpret that data properly. For example, in evaluating the performance of a new laboratory method by analyzing 40 specimens on a new method and a comparison method, what is the probability, or chance, that the difference observed between methods represents a real measurement error and not just a figment of the noise in the data (random error, imprecision, or scatter). In laboratory quality control, where it is common to make only two or three measurements, what is the probability of detecting medically important errors when using a Levey-Jennings control chart with control limits set as the mean plus and minus 2 SD? What is the chance of a false rejection, i.e., an out-of-control signal even though the method is working properly?  You most likely have already been exposed to the topic of probability in earlier courses. You may have used probability in your genetics class to construct a Punnet square. You may have used probability theory in chemistry to predict the number of isomers for compounds containing asymmetric carbon groups.  Probability  Probability is a number from 0.00 to 1.00 that represents the chance that an event will occur. A probability of 1.00 means the event will always occur. A probability of 0.00 means the event will never occur. It's also common to talk about the chance of occurrence, which is commonly described by percentage figures between 0.0% and 100.0%.  Coin toss examples. What is the chance of tossing a coin and having it land heads up (H)? Mathematically, the chance of H or probability of H on one toss of one fair coin (that has one head and one tail) is equal to the number of heads (H) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (heads plus tails, or H + T): Pr(H) = H/(H+T) or ½ or 0.50. That's why it's fair to toss a coin to decide which football team gets to receive the ball and which has to kick off because both sides have an equal or 50% chance with a single coin toss.  Now, if we tossed five coins, what would be the most likely outcome? The answer is some combination of heads and tails. Intuitively, we know that the chance of tossing 5 coins and having all of them come up heads is quite small. That chance is the product of each of the single episodes: Pr(H) = (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = (1/2) 5 or (0.5) 5 or 0.03125. There is only a probability of about 0.03 or a 3% chance of getting heads on all 5 coins.          With a 5 coin toss, it's likely to see some combinations of heads and tails based on these possible outcomes: 5H+0T, 4H+1T, 3H+2T, 2H+3T, 1H+4T, and 0H+5T. All heads would occur 1/32 times or 0.03 probability, as shown at the right. Similarly, all tails would occur 0.03 of the time. Intuitively, the greatest possibility lies in having some mixture of H and T, possibly 2.5 heads - but that number is not a reality or a real number here. The expected frequency distribution can be seen in the top figure, which shows the distribution of possibilities as fractions of 32nds. The possibilities total to thirty-two 32nds or unity. The area under the curve is greatest between 2 and 4 heads, i.e., that is the highest probability or most likely outcome.  Probability distribution.  The frequency distribution for a 10 coin toss is shown in the second figure. Again, intuitively speaking, the greatest possibility is some mixture of H and T. With a 10 coin toss, achieving half heads or 5 is a real number, and the maximum probability is 0.50, as shown by the peak of the curve.  The distribution of a 20 coin toss is seen in the third figure. Again, the greatest area under the curve indicates some combination of heads and tails. When increasing the number of coins or events, the curves begin to look like normal distribution curves. As the number of events exceeds 30, the graph is considered to approximate a normal curve.        Statistical significance. The importance of this point is that a normal curve can often be used to assess the probability that an event or observed difference occurs by chance or by cause. In interpreting experimental results, it is common to use a probability of 0.05 as the cutoff between a chance occurrence and a cause occurrence. If the probability is greater than 0.05, i.e., Pr>0.05, the conclusion is that no difference exists. If Pr<0.05, then it is often concluded that a statistically significant difference has been observed; in short, that means there is a real difference due to some cause. That's why an understanding of probability is very useful for making inferences or decisions on the basis of experimental data. In the next section, we will see where that 0.05 comes from.   Standard Normal Distribution  The standard normal distribution or the unit normal distribution is a special normal curve made up of z-scores. Remember that a z-score is a standard score (also called the standard Gaussian variable) that is calculated by subtracting the mean from a value and dividing the result by the standard deviation: z = (value - mean)/standard deviation. For example, if the mean were 100 and the value were 110, then the difference between the mean and the value is 10. If the standard deviation were 5, then the difference of 10 has 2 SD's in it, thereby it is equal to 2z.  As discussed in lessons 1 and 2, this is one of those statistical forms that appears repeatedly in laboratory statistics. The formula is used to express the number of standard deviations in the difference between a value and the mean. The values for z range from zero to infinity. The figure shows that the most common z-scores are from 0.00 to 3.00. A z of 0.00 represents the mean and the range of z from +3.00 to - 3.00 encompasses almost all of the area of the distribution. In statistical language, this distribution can be described as N(0,1), which indicates distribution is normal (N) and has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  Area under a normal curve. The total area under the curve is equal to 1.00 or unity. Half of the area, or 0.50, is on either side of the mean. The area between the mean and -1.00 z is 0.34 and the area between the mean and +1.00 z is 0.34, therefore the mean +/- 1.00z represents 68% of the area under a normal curve. The area between -2.00 z and +2.00 z is 0.47 + 0.47 or approximately 95% of the area under the curve. Between -3.00 z and + 3.00 z is 0.49 + 0.49 or approximately 99% of the area under the curve. (These numbers should seem familiar to laboratorians.) Note also that the use of +/- 2.00 z encompasses 95% of the area or a .95 probability. The remaining 1% or 0.01 probability is left in the tails of the curve. Z-scores can also be listed as decimal fractions of the 1's, 2's, and 3's we have been using thus far. For example, you could have 1.40 z's. Here the decimal fraction is carried out to the hundreths place.  Table of areas under a normal curve. It is often convenient to use a table of areas under a standard normal curve to convert an observed z-score into the area or probability represented by that score. See the table of areas under a standard normal curve which shows the z-score in the left column and the corresponding area in the next column. In actuality, the area represented in the table is only one half of the normal curve, but since the normal curve is symmetrical, the other half can also be estimated from the same table and the 0.50 on the upper half plus the 0.50 in the lower half equals 1.00 or all of the distribution.  As an example use of the table, a z-score of 1.40 is listed as having an area of 0.4192. This indicates that 41.92% of the area is between the mean or center of the distribution and the z-score of 1.40. The area beyond that particular z-score to the tail end of the distribution would be the difference between 0.5000 and the value of 0.4192, or 0.0808 because the table represents one half or 0.5000 of the area of the distribution. Now let's look at the lower half of the distribution down to a z-score of -1.40 (i.e. a negative 1.40). This too represents an area of .4192. At +/- 1.40, you would have .4192 plus .4192 or .9394 of the are under the curve. Sometimes statisticians want to accumulate all of the negative z-score area (the left half of the curve) and add to that some of the postive z-score area. All of the negative area equals .5000 plus some of the positive area, here .4192, added together would give .9142.  Here is an example of how to use the table: to find the area for a z-score of 1.96, find the value of 1.9 in the leftmost column, then find the hundredth figure from the column heading for .06, and read the area below that column, e.g., 0.4750. The area from -1.96 to +1.96 would encompass 2*0.475 or 95% of the area under a normal curve, leaving 5% outside those limits or 5% in the tails. Note that we commonly think of a 95% range as the mean plus or minus 2z or 2 SD, but that's an approximation and the exact z-score should be 1.96.  At 3.00 z, the area under the curve is 0.4987, which leaves an area of approximately 0.0013 outside in the tail. The area from -3.00 to +3.00 encompasses 2*0.4987 or 99.74% of the area, leaving only 0.26% outside. This is why 3 SD control limits have a very low chance of false rejections compared to 2 SD limits.  z-score transformation formula. The concept of the standard normal distribution will become increasingly important because there are many useful applications. If the population mean, µ, and the population standard deviation, , of any normally distributed data are known, the z-scores can be computed through the use of the following z score transformation formula:  z = (X - µ)/s  Again the formula represents the value minus the mean all divided by the standard deviation. The formula defines the difference score (X - µ or X-Xbar or delta, as seen in earlier lessons), according to how many standard deviation units it represents.  Proficiency testing example. One useful application is in proficiency testing (PT), where a laboratory analyzes a series of samples to demonstrate that it can provide correct answers. The results from PT surveys often include z-scores. For example, a glucose test value on a proficiency testing sample is observed to be 275 mg/dl. Other laboratories that analyzed this same sample show a mean value of 260 and a standard deviation of 6.0 mg/dL. In comparison to these values, our laboratory's analysis has a z-score of +2.50, which means that less than 1% of other laboratories got a higher test result (observe that a z-score of +2.50 corresponds to an area of 0.4938, which leaves only 0.0062 or 0.62% of the area in the tail above 2.50). Said another way, there is only a very small chance that the 275 mg/dL glucose value belongs with the rest of the proficiency testing values. Said another way, there is only a 0.0228 probability, or a very small chance, that the 275 glucose really does belong with the other values. Most likely it represents a measurement error by the laboratory.  z-scores vs SDs. Because there is so much confusion concerning this topic, it's worthwhile to review the relation between z-score and standard deviations (SD). The lines between statistical definitions sometimes blur over time.  Remember that the mean and standard deviation are the first statistics that are calculated to describe the variation of measurements or distribution of results. The standard deviation is a term that has the same units as the measurement, therefore it can be used to describe the actual range of measurement results that might be expected.  A z-score can be calculated once the mean and standard deviation are available. The calculated z-score [z-score = (value - mean)/SD] describes where a value is located in the distribution, e.g., a z-score of 0 is at the mean of the distribution and a z-score of 2.0 or beyond is in the tails of the distribution. Notice that SD is in the denominator of the z-score formula, so SD's and z's are not really the same. The z-score is a ratio and therefore is unitless, whereas the SD is expressed in concentration units.  But, we tend to think in terms of ±2SD as if they were ±2z. We use the SD like a z-score by saying that, if a value falls out of the curve >±2SD, then it is different from 95% of the rest of the curve (we probably should have been saying ±2z). When a value lies at >±2z's (SD's), then that value is outside of the 95% area under the curve. So 1.00 - 0.95 = 0.05. That value lies in the 0.05 area of the tails. We often use this probability of 0.05 as an indicator of statistical significance, i.e. when a value falls out >±2SD (or z's), then a statistically significant or real difference has been observed (with Pr < 0.05 that the value is a chance occurrence).  Relationship to t-distribution. In the above PT example, the population mean (µ) and the population standard deviation (s) were known quantities, i.e., the data from all laboratories participating in the proficiency testing survey were included in the calculations, thus the true mean and true standard deviation are known for the whole population. When the population mean and standard deviation are not known, which is a more typical situation, z-scores cannot be calculated. In fact, in most laboratory applications, µ and s are not known. There is, however, another family of distributions - the t-distributions - which can be used when the µ and s are approximated by Xbar and SD.  The t-distributions generally are said to have "heavier tails" as compared to the normal distribution. As the sample size gets larger and larger (N increases to about 30 or 40), these distributions begin to approximate the normal curve and can be used much like the unit normal curve because ±2t accumulates about 95% of the area under the curve. A t-value can be calculated much like a z-value, e.g., tcalc = (observed value - mean)/sXbar, where sXbar represents the standard error of the mean, which we learned about in lesson 5. If tcalc is greater than +/- 2, then a conclusion can be drawn about that particular value. A t-distribution can be used to help in making the decision that the means of two samples are far enough apart to be considered to be different, i.e., the difference is statistically significant, or close enough together to be considered the same, i.e., the difference is not statistically significant. When N is less than 30, it will be necessary to look up a critical t-value from a table.   Self-assessment questions   What is the probability of tossing three fair coins and getting all heads? What's the probability of getting three tails? What's the probability of getting some other combination of heads and tails?  What is a z-score?  For a z-score of 1.65, what is the area of the standard normal curve below that value? What is the area above that value?  How is the standard normal curve useful for data interpretation?  If an observed difference is greater than +/- 2 z, that difference is considered statistically significant at what probability?  Under what conditions do you use a t-distribution rather than a z-distribution?   About the author: Madelon F. Zady  Madelon F.

How Common is Oral Sex? Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex? Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex? Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex? What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex? What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?      Fast Facts  Many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be spread through oral sex.  Using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex can reduce the risk of giving or getting an STD.  Although oral sex may carry a lower risk for spreading HIV than other forms of sex, repeated unprotected exposures may increase risk of transmission.   What is Oral Sex?  Oral sex involves using the mouth, lips, or tongue to stimulate the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (anilingus) of a sex partner. The penis and testicles and the vagina and area around the vagina are also called the genitals or genital area.   How Common is Oral Sex?  Oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active adults. Oral sex can happen between heterosexual (straight) and same-sex (gay or lesbian) couples. More than 85% of sexually active adults aged 18-44 years reported having had oral sex at least once with a partner of the opposite sex. A separate survey conducted during 2007-2010 found that 33% of teenage girls and boys aged 15-17 years reported having had oral sex with a partner of the opposite sex.   Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex?  Many STDs, as well as other infections, can be spread through oral sex. Anyone exposed to an infected partner can get an STD in the mouth, throat, genitals, or rectum. The risk of getting an STD from oral sex, or spreading an STD to others through oral sex, depends on a number of things, including  The particular STD.  The sex acts practiced.  How common the STD is in the population to which the sex partners belong.  The number of specific sex acts performed.    In general:  It may be possible to get some STDs in the mouth or throat from giving oral sex to a partner with a genital or anal/rectal infection, particularly from giving oral sex to a partner with an infected penis.  It also may be possible to get certain STDs on the penis (and possibly the vagina, anus or rectum) from getting oral sex from a partner with a mouth or throat infection.  It’s possible to have an STD in more than one area at the same time, for example in the throat and the genitals.  Several STDs that may be transmitted by oral sex can then spread throughout the body of an infected person.  STDs can be spread to a sex partner even when the infected partner has no signs or symptoms.  If you are infected with an STD, you might not know it because many STDs may have no symptoms .     Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex?   Chlamydia Gonorrhea Syphilis Herpes HPV (human papillomavirus) HIV Trichomoniasis Chlamydia   Chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  chlamydia in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract may result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with chlamydia in the throat can result in getting chlamydia of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most chlamydia infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Many genital, urinary tract, or rectal chlamydia infections have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge   Treatment:  Chlamydia can be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with chlamydia should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with chlamydia should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners, particularly by performing oral sex on a male partner’s penis.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women : Might result in premature birth or low birth weight in babies.  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause chlamydia infection in the eyes or infection of the respiratory tract that can develop into pneumonia.   In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause a reaction (reactive arthritis) throughout the body that can lead to arthritis (joint pain), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and/or a rash on the soles of the feet or elsewhere.   Gonorrhea   Gonorrhea ( Neisseria gonorrhoeae )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  gonorrhea in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat may result in getting gonorrhea of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most gonorrhea infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Symptoms of genital, urinary tract, or rectal infection may include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge.   Treatment:  Infections in the throat are harder to cure than genital or rectal infections but can be treated with recommended antibiotics.  Genital and rectal infections can also be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with gonorrhea should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with gonorrhea should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Might spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to other sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women :  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause blindness, joint infection, or a life-threatening blood infection in the baby.  In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected, which is a serious and potentially life threatening condition.   Syphilis   Syphilis ( Treponema pallidum )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the genitals or anus can result in getting syphilis.  Getting oral sex from a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the lips or mouth, or in the throat, can result in getting syphilis.  Another important factor that affects risk of spreading syphilis is how long an infected partner has had syphilis.  Areas of initial infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genitals  Anus  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  One or more painless ulcers or sores on the lips, mouth, or throat; on the skin; or on or near the genitals or anus.  Rash on trunk, palms of hands, and/or soles of feet.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment:  Syphilis can be cured with the right medicine.  Sex partners of a person with syphilis should also be tested for infection, including some of the infected person’s past sex partners. Some of these partners should be treated even if their syphilis test results are negative.  If left untreated, syphilis:  Can be spread to others through contact with syphilis sores or rash.  In pregnant women: Can be spread to the baby during pregnancy.  Can cause stillbirth (a baby born dead).  Babies with untreated syphilis may become developmentally delayed, have seizures, or die.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection.  Can increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause damage to internal organs, blindness, muscle weakness, dementia, and even death.   Herpes   Herpes  (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum may result in getting herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat.  Getting oral sex from a partner with herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat can result in getting herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum.  Areas of infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Anus  Rectum  Buttocks  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  Headache or fever (during initial infection).  Painful or itching sores at or near the area of infection.  Treatment:  There is no cure for a herpes, but antiviral medicine can shorten and help decrease symptoms of herpes outbreaks.  Daily antiviral medication can prevent or shorten herpes outbreaks.  Even with treatment, oral (lip, mouth and throat) infections:  Can be spread to others, including sex partners.  Even with treatment, genital area, buttock, anal, and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In pregnant women: May be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause brain damage, damage to internal organs, or even death of the baby.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Can increase risk of giving HIV to sex partners.   HPV (human papillomavirus)   HPV (human papillomavirus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an HPV-infected penis or genital area can result in getting HPV in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an HPV-infected vagina or genital area can result in getting HPV in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with HPV on the anus or in the rectum may result in getting HPV in the throat.*  Getting oral sex from a partner with HPV in the throat might result in getting HPV on the genital area, anus, or rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of infection:  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Vagina  Cervix  Anus  Rectum  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms.  Warts in the throat (laryngeal or respiratory papillomatosis): May cause changes in the voice, difficulty speaking, or shortness of breath.   Genital or anal warts.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus that can be found by clinical examination and tests ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Some types of HPV can lead to vaginal or cervical cancer, anal, penile, head, and neck cancers.  Vaccine:   HPV vaccine protects against transmission of certain types of HPV. HPV vaccine is is recommended for 11- or 12-year-old girls, and for girls and women ages 13 through 26 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Girls as young as age 9 years may be vaccinated.  HPV vaccine is also recommended for 11- or 12-year-old boys, and for boys and men ages 13 through 21 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Boys as young as age 9 years and men through age 26 years may also be vaccinated.  Vaccination through age 26 years is recommended for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those who are living with HIV) who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses.   Treatment:  Warts in the mouth and throat: May disappear, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Surgery may be used to remove warts in the throat.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Genital and anal warts: May go away on their own, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Treatments include medicines applied to the warts, freezing the warts (cryotherapy), or surgery to remove the warts.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus: May need more clinical examination and testing ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Other procedures may be used, such as biopsy (taking a small sample of tissue) and/or removal of abnormal tissue, depending on age, pregnancy status, and test results.   Even with treatment, warts in the throat:  Might be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May have recurrences (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).  Even with treatment, genital and anal warts:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May return but will not develop into cancer.  Mouth and throat infections by several types of HPV that do not cause warts may develop into head or neck cancer.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina or anus:  Might develop into cancer. Although some women have abnormal Pap and/or HPV test results , few women get cervical cancer if they get the appropriate follow-up and treatment.  HIV   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex on the penis of a man with HIV can result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is lower than the risks from vaginal or anal sex.  Giving oral sex on the vagina of a woman with HIV may result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is thought to be very low.  Giving oral sex on the anus of a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be very low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be extremely low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Another important factor that affects risk of HIV spread is the virus level (i.e., viral load) in an infected partner’s blood and other body fluids at the time of the sexual encounter. A low HIV viral load in an infected partner does not completely eliminate the risk of spreading HIV from oral sex.   Areas of infection:  Iinfection of the immune system throughout the body.  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms for many years.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment  There is no cure for HIV, but antiviral and other medicines can help people with HIV live longer with a better quality of life.  Even with treatment, HIV infection:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Can increase the risk of getting certain infections and cancers.  Trichomoniasis   Trichomoniasis (infection with T. vaginalis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or a man with an infected penis might result in getting trichomoniasis of the throat. There are few reports of potential spread from oral sex.  Spread of trichomoniasis by other oral sex practices has not been reported.  Areas of initial infection  Vagina  Penis  Mouth/throat (possibly)  Initial signs and symptoms of infection  Infections of the genitals or urinary tract may have no symptoms, especially in men  Symptoms of genital or urinary tract infection can include: Discharge from vagina or penis.  Vaginal area redness.  Vaginal itching.  Burning feeling when urinating.   Treatment  Can be cured with right medicine.  The sex partners of people with trichomoniasis should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with trichomoniasis should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, genital or urinary infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.    In addition to the STDs above, other infections such as hepatitis A virus , Shigella and intestinal parasites ( amebiasis ) can be spread through giving oral sex on the anus.   Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex?  Many STDs can be spread through oral sex. However, it is difficult to compare the exact risks of getting specific STDs from specific types of sexual activity. This is partly because most people who have oral sex also have vaginal or anal sex. Also, few studies have looked at the risks of getting STDs other than HIV from giving oral sex on the vagina or anus, compared to giving oral sex on the penis.  Studies have shown that the risk of getting HIV from having oral sex with an infected partner (either giving or getting oral sex) is much lower than the risk of getting HIV from anal or vaginal sex with an infected partner. This may not be true for other STDs – in one study of gay men with syphilis, 1 out of 5 reported having only oral sex. Getting HIV from oral sex may be less likely than vaginal or anal sex, but it still carries risk. If you are having oral sex you should still protect yourself. Repeated unprotected oral sex exposure to HIV may represent a considerable risk for spread of HIV, as well as other STDs for which the risk of spread through oral sex has not been as well studied.   It is possible that getting certain STDs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, in the throat may not pose as great a threat to an infected person’s health as getting an STD in the genital area or rectum. Having these infections in the throat might increase the risk of getting HIV. Having gonorrhea in the throat also may lead to spread of the disease throughout the body. In addition: Having infections of chlamydia and gonorrhea in the throat may make it easier to spread these infections to others through oral sex. This is especially important for gonorrhea, since throat infections are harder to treat than urinary, genital or rectal infections.  Infections from certain STDs, such as syphilis and HIV, spread throughout the body. Therefore, infections that are acquired in the throat may lead to the same health problems as infections acquired in the genitals or rectum.  Mouth and throat infections by certain types of HPV may develop into oral or neck cancer.    What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex?  It is possible that certain factors may increase a person’s chances of getting HIV or other STDs during oral sex if exposed to an infected partner, such as:  Having poor oral health which can include tooth decay, gum disease or bleeding gums, and oral cancer.  Having sores in the mouth or on the genitals.  Being exposed to the “pre-cum” or “cum” (also known as pre-ejaculate or ejaculate) of an infected partner.  However, no scientific studies have been done to show whether or not these factors actually do increase the risk of getting HIV or STDs from oral sex.   What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?  You can lower your chances of giving or getting STDs during oral sex by using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex.  For oral sex on the penis: Cover the penis with a non-lubricated latex condom.  Use plastic (polyurethane) condoms if you or your partner is allergic to latex.   For oral sex on the vagina or anus: Use a dental dam.  Cut open a condom to make a square, and put it between the mouth and the partner’s vagina or anus.   The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting an STD:  Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results).  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.  It’s important to remember that many infected individuals may be unaware of their infection because STDs often have no symptoms and are unrecognized.  If you are sexually active, you should get tested regularly for STDs and HIV and talk to your partner(s) about STDs. If you think you might have an STD, stop having sex and visit your doctor or clinic to get tested. There are free and low-cost options for testing in your area. It is important that you talk openly with your health care provider about any activities that might put you at risk for an STD, including oral sex.

How Common is Oral Sex? Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex? Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex? Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex? What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex? What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?      Fast Facts  Many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be spread through oral sex.  Using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex can reduce the risk of giving or getting an STD.  Although oral sex may carry a lower risk for spreading HIV than other forms of sex, repeated unprotected exposures may increase risk of transmission.   What is Oral Sex?  Oral sex involves using the mouth, lips, or tongue to stimulate the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (anilingus) of a sex partner. The penis and testicles and the vagina and area around the vagina are also called the genitals or genital area.   How Common is Oral Sex?  Oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active adults. Oral sex can happen between heterosexual (straight) and same-sex (gay or lesbian) couples. More than 85% of sexually active adults aged 18-44 years reported having had oral sex at least once with a partner of the opposite sex. A separate survey conducted during 2007-2010 found that 33% of teenage girls and boys aged 15-17 years reported having had oral sex with a partner of the opposite sex.   Can STDs Be Spread During Oral Sex?  Many STDs, as well as other infections, can be spread through oral sex. Anyone exposed to an infected partner can get an STD in the mouth, throat, genitals, or rectum. The risk of getting an STD from oral sex, or spreading an STD to others through oral sex, depends on a number of things, including  The particular STD.  The sex acts practiced.  How common the STD is in the population to which the sex partners belong.  The number of specific sex acts performed.    In general:  It may be possible to get some STDs in the mouth or throat from giving oral sex to a partner with a genital or anal/rectal infection, particularly from giving oral sex to a partner with an infected penis.  It also may be possible to get certain STDs on the penis (and possibly the vagina, anus or rectum) from getting oral sex from a partner with a mouth or throat infection.  It’s possible to have an STD in more than one area at the same time, for example in the throat and the genitals.  Several STDs that may be transmitted by oral sex can then spread throughout the body of an infected person.  STDs can be spread to a sex partner even when the infected partner has no signs or symptoms.  If you are infected with an STD, you might not know it because many STDs may have no symptoms .     Which STDs Can Be Passed On from Oral Sex?   Chlamydia Gonorrhea Syphilis Herpes HPV (human papillomavirus) HIV Trichomoniasis Chlamydia   Chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  chlamydia in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract may result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting chlamydia in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with chlamydia in the throat can result in getting chlamydia of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most chlamydia infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Many genital, urinary tract, or rectal chlamydia infections have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge   Treatment:  Chlamydia can be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with chlamydia should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with chlamydia should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners, particularly by performing oral sex on a male partner’s penis.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women : Might result in premature birth or low birth weight in babies.  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause chlamydia infection in the eyes or infection of the respiratory tract that can develop into pneumonia.   In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause a reaction (reactive arthritis) throughout the body that can lead to arthritis (joint pain), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and/or a rash on the soles of the feet or elsewhere.   Gonorrhea   Gonorrhea ( Neisseria gonorrhoeae )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an infected penis can result in getting  gonorrhea in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or urinary tract might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with an infected rectum might result in getting gonorrhea in the throat.*  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat may result in getting gonorrhea of the penis.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea of the vagina or urinary tract.*  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with gonorrhea in the throat might result in getting gonorrhea in the rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of initial infection:  Throat  Genitals  Urinary tract  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  Most gonorrhea infections in the throat have no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can include a sore throat.  Symptoms of genital, urinary tract, or rectal infection may include: Discharge from vagina or penis (discharge from the vagina may be bloody).  Burning feeling when urinating.  Painful or swollen testicles.  Rectal pain or discharge.   Treatment:  Infections in the throat are harder to cure than genital or rectal infections but can be treated with recommended antibiotics.  Genital and rectal infections can also be cured with the right medicine.  The sex partners of a person with gonorrhea should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with gonorrhea should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, throat infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Might spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  If left untreated, genital, urinary and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to other sex partners.  In women: Can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside of the womb).   In pregnant women :  Can be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause blindness, joint infection, or a life-threatening blood infection in the baby.  In men: Can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that may lead to ductal scarring.   In both men and women: May increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Might increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May spread through the body causing skin sores and joint pain. This condition is called disseminated gonococcal infection. The heart can also be infected, which is a serious and potentially life threatening condition.   Syphilis   Syphilis ( Treponema pallidum )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the genitals or anus can result in getting syphilis.  Getting oral sex from a partner with a syphilis sore or rash on the lips or mouth, or in the throat, can result in getting syphilis.  Another important factor that affects risk of spreading syphilis is how long an infected partner has had syphilis.  Areas of initial infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genitals  Anus  Rectum  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  One or more painless ulcers or sores on the lips, mouth, or throat; on the skin; or on or near the genitals or anus.  Rash on trunk, palms of hands, and/or soles of feet.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment:  Syphilis can be cured with the right medicine.  Sex partners of a person with syphilis should also be tested for infection, including some of the infected person’s past sex partners. Some of these partners should be treated even if their syphilis test results are negative.  If left untreated, syphilis:  Can be spread to others through contact with syphilis sores or rash.  In pregnant women: Can be spread to the baby during pregnancy.  Can cause stillbirth (a baby born dead).  Babies with untreated syphilis may become developmentally delayed, have seizures, or die.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection.  Can increase risk of spreading HIV to sex partners.  May cause damage to internal organs, blindness, muscle weakness, dementia, and even death.   Herpes   Herpes  (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a partner with herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum may result in getting herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat.  Getting oral sex from a partner with herpes on the lips, mouth, or in the throat can result in getting herpes on the genital area, anus, buttocks, or in the rectum.  Areas of infection:  Lips  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Anus  Rectum  Buttocks  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May not have symptoms.  Headache or fever (during initial infection).  Painful or itching sores at or near the area of infection.  Treatment:  There is no cure for a herpes, but antiviral medicine can shorten and help decrease symptoms of herpes outbreaks.  Daily antiviral medication can prevent or shorten herpes outbreaks.  Even with treatment, oral (lip, mouth and throat) infections:  Can be spread to others, including sex partners.  Even with treatment, genital area, buttock, anal, and/or rectal infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  In pregnant women: May be spread to the baby during delivery, and can cause brain damage, damage to internal organs, or even death of the baby.   In both men and women: Can increase risk of getting HIV infection .  Can increase risk of giving HIV to sex partners.   HPV (human papillomavirus)   HPV (human papillomavirus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a man with an HPV-infected penis or genital area can result in getting HPV in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a woman with an HPV-infected vagina or genital area can result in getting HPV in the throat.  Giving oral sex to a man or woman with HPV on the anus or in the rectum may result in getting HPV in the throat.*  Getting oral sex from a partner with HPV in the throat might result in getting HPV on the genital area, anus, or rectum.*  * Statements followed by an asterisk (*) have not been well studied.  Areas of infection:  Mouth  Throat  Genital area  Vagina  Cervix  Anus  Rectum  Signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms.  Warts in the throat (laryngeal or respiratory papillomatosis): May cause changes in the voice, difficulty speaking, or shortness of breath.   Genital or anal warts.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus that can be found by clinical examination and tests ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Some types of HPV can lead to vaginal or cervical cancer, anal, penile, head, and neck cancers.  Vaccine:   HPV vaccine protects against transmission of certain types of HPV. HPV vaccine is is recommended for 11- or 12-year-old girls, and for girls and women ages 13 through 26 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Girls as young as age 9 years may be vaccinated.  HPV vaccine is also recommended for 11- or 12-year-old boys, and for boys and men ages 13 through 21 years who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses. Boys as young as age 9 years and men through age 26 years may also be vaccinated.  Vaccination through age 26 years is recommended for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those who are living with HIV) who have not yet been vaccinated with all recommended doses.   Treatment:  Warts in the mouth and throat: May disappear, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Surgery may be used to remove warts in the throat.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Genital and anal warts: May go away on their own, remain unchanged, or grow in size or number.  Treatments include medicines applied to the warts, freezing the warts (cryotherapy), or surgery to remove the warts.  Treatment may reduce warts but does not cure HPV infection.   Abnormal changes in cells of vagina, cervix, or anus: May need more clinical examination and testing ( Pap and/or HPV tests ).  Other procedures may be used, such as biopsy (taking a small sample of tissue) and/or removal of abnormal tissue, depending on age, pregnancy status, and test results.   Even with treatment, warts in the throat:  Might be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May have recurrences (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).  Even with treatment, genital and anal warts:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  May return but will not develop into cancer.  Mouth and throat infections by several types of HPV that do not cause warts may develop into head or neck cancer.  Abnormal changes in cells of vagina or anus:  Might develop into cancer. Although some women have abnormal Pap and/or HPV test results , few women get cervical cancer if they get the appropriate follow-up and treatment.  HIV   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex on the penis of a man with HIV can result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is lower than the risks from vaginal or anal sex.  Giving oral sex on the vagina of a woman with HIV may result in getting HIV. The risk of infection is thought to be very low.  Giving oral sex on the anus of a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Getting oral sex on the penis from a partner with HIV may result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be very low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the vagina from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. This risk is thought to be extremely low, but has not been well studied.  Getting oral sex on the anus from a partner with HIV might result in getting HIV. There are few reports of transmission from this type of oral sex.  Another important factor that affects risk of HIV spread is the virus level (i.e., viral load) in an infected partner’s blood and other body fluids at the time of the sexual encounter. A low HIV viral load in an infected partner does not completely eliminate the risk of spreading HIV from oral sex.   Areas of infection:  Iinfection of the immune system throughout the body.  Initial signs and symptoms of infection:  May have no symptoms for many years.  Flu-like symptoms.  Treatment  There is no cure for HIV, but antiviral and other medicines can help people with HIV live longer with a better quality of life.  Even with treatment, HIV infection:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.  Can increase the risk of getting certain infections and cancers.  Trichomoniasis   Trichomoniasis (infection with T. vaginalis )    Risk of infection from oral sex:  Giving oral sex to a woman with an infected vagina or a man with an infected penis might result in getting trichomoniasis of the throat. There are few reports of potential spread from oral sex.  Spread of trichomoniasis by other oral sex practices has not been reported.  Areas of initial infection  Vagina  Penis  Mouth/throat (possibly)  Initial signs and symptoms of infection  Infections of the genitals or urinary tract may have no symptoms, especially in men  Symptoms of genital or urinary tract infection can include: Discharge from vagina or penis.  Vaginal area redness.  Vaginal itching.  Burning feeling when urinating.   Treatment  Can be cured with right medicine.  The sex partners of people with trichomoniasis should also be tested for infection. Those who are diagnosed with trichomoniasis should not have sex until they and their sex partners have completed treatment.  If left untreated, genital or urinary infections:  Can be spread to uninfected sex partners.    In addition to the STDs above, other infections such as hepatitis A virus , Shigella and intestinal parasites ( amebiasis ) can be spread through giving oral sex on the anus.   Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Anal Sex?  Many STDs can be spread through oral sex. However, it is difficult to compare the exact risks of getting specific STDs from specific types of sexual activity. This is partly because most people who have oral sex also have vaginal or anal sex. Also, few studies have looked at the risks of getting STDs other than HIV from giving oral sex on the vagina or anus, compared to giving oral sex on the penis.  Studies have shown that the risk of getting HIV from having oral sex with an infected partner (either giving or getting oral sex) is much lower than the risk of getting HIV from anal or vaginal sex with an infected partner. This may not be true for other STDs – in one study of gay men with syphilis, 1 out of 5 reported having only oral sex. Getting HIV from oral sex may be less likely than vaginal or anal sex, but it still carries risk. If you are having oral sex you should still protect yourself. Repeated unprotected oral sex exposure to HIV may represent a considerable risk for spread of HIV, as well as other STDs for which the risk of spread through oral sex has not been as well studied.   It is possible that getting certain STDs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, in the throat may not pose as great a threat to an infected person’s health as getting an STD in the genital area or rectum. Having these infections in the throat might increase the risk of getting HIV. Having gonorrhea in the throat also may lead to spread of the disease throughout the body. In addition: Having infections of chlamydia and gonorrhea in the throat may make it easier to spread these infections to others through oral sex. This is especially important for gonorrhea, since throat infections are harder to treat than urinary, genital or rectal infections.  Infections from certain STDs, such as syphilis and HIV, spread throughout the body. Therefore, infections that are acquired in the throat may lead to the same health problems as infections acquired in the genitals or rectum.  Mouth and throat infections by certain types of HPV may develop into oral or neck cancer.    What May Increase the Chances of Giving or Getting an STD through Oral Sex?  It is possible that certain factors may increase a person’s chances of getting HIV or other STDs during oral sex if exposed to an infected partner, such as:  Having poor oral health which can include tooth decay, gum disease or bleeding gums, and oral cancer.  Having sores in the mouth or on the genitals.  Being exposed to the “pre-cum” or “cum” (also known as pre-ejaculate or ejaculate) of an infected partner.  However, no scientific studies have been done to show whether or not these factors actually do increase the risk of getting HIV or STDs from oral sex.   What Can You Do to Prevent STD Transmission During Oral Sex?  You can lower your chances of giving or getting STDs during oral sex by using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time you have oral sex.  For oral sex on the penis: Cover the penis with a non-lubricated latex condom.  Use plastic (polyurethane) condoms if you or your partner is allergic to latex.   For oral sex on the vagina or anus: Use a dental dam.  Cut open a condom to make a square, and put it between the mouth and the partner’s vagina or anus.   The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting an STD:  Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results).  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.  It’s important to remember that many infected individuals may be unaware of their infection because STDs often have no symptoms and are unrecognized.  If you are sexually active, you should get tested regularly for STDs and HIV and talk to your partner(s) about STDs. If you think you might have an STD, stop having sex and visit your doctor or clinic to get tested. There are free and low-cost options for testing in your area. It is important that you talk openly with your health care provider about any activities that might put you at risk for an STD, including oral sex.

Emma Cannon does not, she laughs, have all the answers but, having founded the Fertility Support Clinic in 2004, she has come to be relied upon for using a more natural approach to conceiving. With over 50,000 hours of clinical experience to her name and an average of 360 new clients each year, she has become something of a ‘baby whisperer.’  “One in 28 babies are born to women over 40 ,” Cannon, 49, explains, “but [we’re told] you only have a five percent chance of getting pregnant every month when you’re 40, so where do these statistics really come from? Science would have you believe our fertility falls of a cliff at 38 , but so many other factors come into play. We don’t all decline the same way at the same time.”  With a raft of older women, from 64-year-old Julia Peyton-Jones to Janet Jackson , 50, becoming mothers for the first time in recent months, and conception rates growing in the UK, there is more focus than ever on keeping the body healthy as it ages.                 64-year-old Julia-Peyton Jones recently announced the birth of her first child   Credit: Walpole Awards          I VF , for so long considered the only hope for women unable to fall pregnant naturally, has come under fire of late, with leading fertility expert Lord Robert Winston criticising clinics who insist on ‘unnecessary’ treatments for vulnerable couples hoping to conceive - particularly as women remain fertile until they are 45.  Cannon believes IVF isn’t the only answer for women wanting to fall pregnant, and that many could find their fertility better boosted through acupuncture , making simple lifestyle changes and, actually, just having more sex - all of which she details in her new book, Fertile. It offers a combination of practical advice on nourishing the body before starting to try for a baby or beginning IVF, and delicious recipes created with Cannon’s friend and nutritionist, Victoria Wells.  “I‘ve known patients go for IVF who aren’t regularly having sex and aren’t given advice on regular sex,” Cannon says. “But a lot of what I’m doing is about cultivating good health. Often people are prioritising everything but sex . They’ve created a joyless life for themselves and they’re doing endless yoga or furiously juicing and that isn’t working either. The more out of control we feel, the more out of control we can become with things like our diet.”                 "What I’m advocating isn’t perfect either, but my clinic works in a more integrated way. We aren’t ruling out medicine, we are supporting it”   Credit: Clara Molden          T he emotional fallout from trying and failing to pregnant is not, she adds, helped by the fact that we are living in a society in which “we are all so used to getting what we want, when we want it.” Many rely on IVF as a way to get pregnant when “we have been massively oversold [it]. The idea that it works and it works for everyone is nonsense.  “We are told that a truth exists in science and, when it doesn’t work in areas of fertility, people feel really left down. What I’m advocating isn’t perfect either, but my clinic works in a more integrated way. We aren’t ruling out medicine, we are supporting it.”  Cannon urges women to consider that “the older we get, the more important it is to address our lifestyle choices. The rejuvenating and protective aspects of our body reduce. During the time when the eggs are suspended in the ovaries they come under the influence of the ovarian environment and there is a small window there where we can potentially make an impact on the quality of the eggs.”       Advice | Types of fertility treatment        I s there a way we can actually change the quality of our own eggs? “This really is the holy grail of fertility,” she says. “The quality of the egg declines with age but this is an area of medicine that is looking to improve the end stage development of the egg.” And, she adds, there are simple steps that can be taken to help things along the way. “ Melatonin is the hormone secreted at night and it can be taken as supplement. Research suggests that higher levels of Melatonin found in the fluid surrounding the developing follicles produced larger follicles during IVF and neutralise free radicals (that can cause disease). Melatonin can be achieved by exposure to sunlight so walk to work in the morning if you can. And avoid light at the end of the day from computers and phones as these can deplete it.”  She also recommends acupuncture , which improves blood flow to the ovaries, regularly visiting your dentist (gum disease is associated with pre-term labour) and increasing your Vitamin D intake, which is said to make the uterus more receptive.                 Cannon also recommends acupuncture as a fertility treatment, which improves blood flow to the ovaries   Credit: Mike Kemp          N ot to be forgotten, however, is paying attention to one’s digestive system and that is where Fertile proves particularly helpful. It presents a natural approach to making one’s body as ready to conceive as possible with a heavy focus on the gut . Half of it is a culmination of scientific research and Cannon’s own years of experience, the other half is a wonderful array of recipes made using fertility-boosting foods such as good oils, fish and chicken broth. “You can have a great diet, but if you have a poor digestive system with inflammation, fermentation and poor gut function, the way everything functions in the pelvic cavity won’t be optimal.”  In an era of food fads and quick fixes, Cannon, who has two daughters aged 16 and 21, promotes a calmer and comparatively sensible approach to eating, continually emphasizing that every individual is different and everyone’s digestive systems are unique. “I don’t believe in Superfoods . All these terms that we attach to foods are actually really damaging. Just eat as near to nature as possible and cook as much as you can.”                 Cannon recommends eating a variety of fermented foods to boost fertility   Credit: Haarala Hamilton          A nd it’s not only what you eat, but how. Too many of us are eating too late in the day; “when we go to bed at night we’re meant to digest our day and not our dinner. Our lifestyle and health do not support fertility, particularly when we are waiting longer to get pregnant.”And speaking of nighttime, we need to get off our iPhones: “there is growing evidence that they affect our circadian rhythms ,” but, also, it means we’re having less sex and, as she firmly points out, “it takes two.”       Eat your way to fertility | The best foods to boost your chances of conception        “Twenty years ago, there was no word for wellness and people didn’t understand it. The medical profession has long been in denial about the impact of food on our lives. We need a conversation in the middle.” And for the many, many women now hoping for conception over the age of 40, IVF doesn’t have to be the only road. In the Eighties, Cannon muses, “so many of us drank a bottle of Chardonnay and ate a packet of Haribos in a cab on the way home and wondered why our ovaries are covered in cysts” but with leaps forward in our understanding of our bodies, eating one’s way to fertility may be the most productive route of all.                 Cooking and eating together is important for couples and their sex lives   Credit: Juice Images / Alamy Stock Photo          “It’s important to remember that the preparation of food itself is a bit like alchemy. It feels really self-healing and means couples are spending time together, off their phones, and far more likely to make love.” It sounds simple but, as Cannon’s clients know, it works.

The initial formulation of the question dates back to at least 1959, when Martin Gardner published one of the earliest variants of the paradox in Scientific American . Titled The Two Children Problem , he phrased the paradox as follows:   Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?  Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   Gardner initially gave the answers 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 , respectively, but later acknowledged that the second question was ambiguous. [3] Its answer could be 1 / 2 , depending on how you found out that one child was a boy. The ambiguity, depending on the exact wording and possible assumptions, was confirmed by Bar-Hillel and Falk, [4] and Nickerson. [5]  Other variants of this question, with varying degrees of ambiguity, have been popularized by Ask Marilyn in Parade Magazine , [6]  John Tierney of The New York Times , [7] and Leonard Mlodinow in Drunkard's Walk . [8] One scientific study showed that when identical information was conveyed, but with different partially ambiguous wordings that emphasized different points, that the percentage of MBA students who answered 1 / 2 changed from 85% to 39%. [2]  The paradox has frequently stimulated a great deal of controversy. [5] Many people argued strongly for both sides with a great deal of confidence, sometimes showing disdain for those who took the opposing view. The paradox stems from whether the problem setup is similar for the two questions. [2] [8] The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 . [2] This answer is intuitive if the question leads the reader to believe that there are two equally likely possibilities for the sex of the second child (i.e., boy and girl), [2] [9] and that the probability of these outcomes is absolute, not conditional . [10]  Biologically, according to studies of the human sex ratio , it is more likely for any one person to be born into the male sex than the female sex.

First, it is assumed that the space of all possible events can be easily enumerated, providing an extensional definition of outcomes: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. [11] This notation indicates that there are four possible combinations of children, labeling boys B and girls G, and using the first letter to represent the older child. Second, it is assumed that these outcomes are equally probable. [11] This implies the following model , a Bernoulli process with p = 1 / 2 :   Each child is either male or female.  Each child has the same chance of being male as of being female.  The sex of each child is independent of the sex of the other.   The mathematical outcome would be the same if it were phrased in terms of a coin toss .  First question [ edit ]        This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .  (February 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   Under the aforementioned assumptions, in this problem, a random family is selected. In this sample space, there are four equally probable events:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Only two of these possible events meet the criteria specified in the question (i.e., GG, GB). Since both of the two possibilities in the new sample space {GG, GB} are equally likely, and only one of the two, GG, includes two girls, the probability that the younger child is also a girl is 1 / 2 .  Second question [ edit ]   Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   This question is identical to question one, except that instead of specifying that the older child is a boy, it is specified that at least one of them is a boy. In response to reader criticism of the question posed in 1959, Gardner agreed that a precise formulation of the question is critical to getting different answers for question 1 and 2. Specifically, Gardner argued that a "failure to specify the randomizing procedure" could lead readers to interpret the question in two distinct ways:   From all families with two children, at least one of whom is a boy, a family is chosen at random. This would yield the answer of 1 / 3 .  From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified to be a boy. This would yield an answer of 1 / 2 . [4] [5]   Grinstead and Snell argue that the question is ambiguous in much the same way Gardner did. [12]  For example, if you see the children in the garden, you may see a boy. The other child may be hidden behind a tree. In this case, the statement is equivalent to the second (the child that you can see is a boy). The first statement does not match as one case is one boy, one girl. Then the girl may be visible. (The first statement says that it can be either.)  While it is certainly true that every possible Mr. Smith has at least one boy (i.e., the condition is necessary) it is not clear that every Mr. Smith with at least one boy is intended. That is, the problem statement does not say that having a boy is a sufficient condition for Mr. Smith to be identified as having a boy this way.  Commenting on Gardner's version of the problem, Bar-Hillel and Falk [4] note that "Mr. Smith, unlike the reader, is presumably aware of the sex of both of his children when making this statement", i.e. that 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' If it is further assumed that Mr. Smith would report this fact if it were true then the correct answer is 1 / 3 as Gardner intended.  Analysis of the ambiguity [ edit ]  If it is assumed that this information was obtained by looking at both children to see if there is at least one boy, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. Three of the four equally probable events for a two-child family in the sample space above meet the condition, as in this table:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Thus, if it is assumed that both children were considered while looking for a boy, the answer to question 2 is 1 / 3 . However, if the family was first selected and then a random, true statement was made about the gender of one child in that family, whether or not both were considered, the correct way to calculate the conditional probability is not to count all of the cases that include a child with that gender. Instead, one must consider only the probabilities where the statement will be made in each case. [12] So, if ALOB represents the event where the statement is "at least one boy", and ALOG represents the event where the statement is "at least one girl", then this table describes the sample space:      Older child  Younger child  P(this family)  P(ALOB given this family)  P(ALOG given this family)  P(ALOB and this family)  P(ALOG and this family)    Girl  Girl  1 / 4  0  1  0  1 / 4    Girl  Boy  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Girl  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Boy  1 / 4  1  0  1 / 4  0      So, if you are told that at least one is a boy when the fact is chosen randomly, the probability that both are boys is          P  (  A  L  O  B   a  n  d   B  B  )    P  (  A  L  O  B  )     =     1  4    0  +    1  8    +    1  8    +    1  4       =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {\frac {P(ALOB\;and\;BB)}{P(ALOB)}} ={\frac {\frac {1}{4}}{0+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The paradox occurs when it is not known how the statement "at least one is a boy" was generated. Either answer could be correct, based on what is assumed. [13]  However, the " 1 / 3 " answer is obtained only by assuming P(ALOB|BG) = P(ALOB|GB) =1, which implies P(ALOG|BG) = P(ALOG|GB) = 0, that is, the other child's sex is never mentioned although it is present. As Marks and Smith say, "This extreme assumption is never included in the presentation of the two-child problem, however, and is surely not what people have in mind when they present it." [13]  Modelling the generative process [ edit ]  Another way to analyse the ambiguity (for question 2) is by making explicit the generative process (all draws are independent).   The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  3      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{3}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Observe      c   1    =  B  ∨   c   2    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{1}=B\vee c_{2}=B}      The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  2      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{2}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw index     i    {\displaystyle i}   equiprobably from     {  1  ,  2  }    {\displaystyle \{1,2\}}    Observe      c   i    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{i}=B}       Bayesian analysis [ edit ]  Following classical probability arguments, we consider a large urn containing two children. We assume equal probability that either is a boy or a girl. The three discernible cases are thus: 1. both are girls (GG) — with probability P(GG) = 1 / 4 , 2. both are boys (BB) — with probability of P(BB) = 1 / 4 , and 3. one of each (G·B) — with probability of P(G·B) = 1 / 2 . These are the prior probabilities.  Now we add the additional assumption that "at least one is a boy" = B. Using Bayes' Theorem , we find        P  (  B  B  ∣  B  )   =   P  (  B  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  B  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    3  4    )     =    1  3     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B)} =\mathrm {P(B\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(B)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{3}}\,.}     where P(A|B) means "probability of A given B". P(B|BB) = probability of at least one boy given both are boys = 1. P(BB) = probability of both boys = 1 / 4 from the prior distribution. P(B) = probability of at least one being a boy, which includes cases BB and G·B = 1 / 4 + 1 / 2 = 3 / 4 .  Note that, although the natural assumption seems to be a probability of 1 / 2 , so the derived value of 1 / 3 seems low, the actual "normal" value for P(BB) is 1 / 4 , so the 1 / 3 is actually a bit higher .  The paradox arises because the second assumption is somewhat artificial, and when describing the problem in an actual setting things get a bit sticky. Just how do we know that "at least" one is a boy? One description of the problem states that we look into a window, see only one child and it is a boy. This sounds like the same assumption. However, this one is equivalent to "sampling" the distribution (i.e. removing one child from the urn, ascertaining that it is a boy, then replacing). Let's call the statement "the sample is a boy" proposition "b". Now we have:        P  (  B  B  ∣  b  )   =   P  (  b  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  b  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    1  2    )     =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid b)} =\mathrm {P(b\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(b)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The difference here is the P(b), which is just the probability of drawing a boy from all possible cases (i.e. without the "at least"), which is clearly 1 / 2 .  The Bayesian analysis generalizes easily to the case in which we relax the 50:50 population assumption. If we have no information about the populations then we assume a "flat prior", i.e. P(GG) = P(BB) = P(G·B) = 1 / 3 . In this case the "at least" assumption produces the result P(BB|B) = 1 / 2 , and the sampling assumption produces P(BB|b) = 2 / 3 , a result also derivable from the Rule of Succession .  Martingale analysis [ edit ]  Suppose you had wagered that Mr Smith had two boys, and received fair odds. You paid $1 and you will receive $4 if he has two boys. We think of your wager as investment that will increase in value as good news arrives. What evidence would make you happier about your investment? Learning that at least one child out of two is a boy, or learning that at least one child out of one is a boy?  The latter is a priori less likely, and therefore better news. That is why the two answers cannot be the same.  Now for the numbers. If we bet on one child and win, the value of your investment has doubled. It must double again to get to $4, so the odds are 1 in 2.  On the other hand if we learn that at least one of two children is a boy, our investment increases as if we had wagered on this question. Our $1 is now worth $ 1  1 / 3 . To get to $4 we still have to increase our wealth threefold. So the answer is 1 in 3.  Variants of the question [ edit ]  Following the popularization of the paradox by Gardner it has been presented and discussed in various forms. The first variant presented by Bar-Hillel & Falk [4] is worded as follows:   Mr. Smith is the father of two. We meet him walking along the street with a young boy whom he proudly introduces as his son. What is the probability that Mr. Smith's other child is also a boy?   Bar-Hillel & Falk use this variant to highlight the importance of considering the underlying assumptions. The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 and, when making the most natural assumptions, this is correct. However, someone may argue that "…before Mr. Smith identifies the boy as his son, we know only that he is either the father of two boys, BB, or of two girls, GG, or of one of each in either birth order, i.e., BG or GB. Assuming again independence and equiprobability, we begin with a probability of 1 / 4 that Smith is the father of two boys. Discovering that he has at least one boy rules out the event GG. Since the remaining three events were equiprobable, we obtain a probability of 1 / 3 for BB." [4]  The natural assumption is that Mr. Smith selected the child companion at random. If so, as combination BB has twice the probability of either BG or GB of having resulted in the boy walking companion (and combination GG has zero probability, ruling it out), the union of events BG and GB becomes equiprobable with event BB, and so the chance that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 2 . Bar-Hillel & Falk, however, suggest an alternative scenario. They imagine a culture in which boys are invariably chosen over girls as walking companions. In this case, the combinations of BB, BG and GB are assumed equally likely to have resulted in the boy walking companion, and thus the probability that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 3 .  In 1991, Marilyn vos Savant responded to a reader who asked her to answer a variant of the Boy or Girl paradox that included beagles. [6] In 1996, she published the question again in a different form. The 1991 and 1996 questions, respectively were phrased:   A shopkeeper says she has two new baby beagles to show you, but she doesn't know whether they're male, female, or a pair. You tell her that you want only a male, and she telephones the fellow who's giving them a bath. "Is at least one a male?" she asks him. "Yes!" she informs you with a smile. What is the probability that the other one is a male?  Say that a woman and a man (who are unrelated) each has two children. We know that at least one of the woman's children is a boy and that the man's oldest child is a boy. Can you explain why the chances that the woman has two boys do not equal the chances that the man has two boys?   With regard to the second formulation Vos Savant gave the classic answer that the chances that the woman has two boys are about 1 / 3 whereas the chances that the man has two boys are about 1 / 2 . In response to reader response that questioned her analysis vos Savant conducted a survey of readers with exactly two children, at least one of which is a boy. Of 17,946 responses, 35.9% reported two boys. [11]  Vos Savant's articles were discussed by Carlton and Stansfield [11] in a 2005 article in The American Statistician . The authors do not discuss the possible ambiguity in the question and conclude that her answer is correct from a mathematical perspective, given the assumptions that the likelihood of a child being a boy or girl is equal, and that the sex of the second child is independent of the first. With regard to her survey they say it "at least validates vos Savant's correct assertion that the “chances” posed in the original question, though similar-sounding, are different, and that the first probability is certainly nearer to 1 in 3 than to 1 in 2."  Carlton and Stansfield go on to discuss the common assumptions in the Boy or Girl paradox. They demonstrate that in reality male children are actually more likely than female children, and that the sex of the second child is not independent of the sex of the first. The authors conclude that, although the assumptions of the question run counter to observations, the paradox still has pedagogical value, since it "illustrates one of the more intriguing applications of conditional probability." [11] Of course, the actual probability values do not matter; the purpose of the paradox is to demonstrate seemingly contradictory logic, not actual birth rates.  Information about the child [ edit ]  Suppose we were told not only that Mr. Smith has two children, and one of them is a boy, but also that the boy was born on a Tuesday: does this change the previous analyses? Again, the answer depends on how this information was presented - what kind of selection process produced this knowledge.  Following the tradition of the problem, suppose that in the population of two-child families, the sex of the two children is independent of one another, equally likely boy or girl, and that the birth date of each child is independent of the other child. The chance of being born on any given day of the week is 1 / 7 .  From Bayes' Theorem that the probability of two boys, given that one boy was born on a Tuesday is given by:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )  =     P  (   B   T    ∣  B  B  )  ×  P  (  B  B  )    P  (   B   T    )        {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})={\frac {P(B_{T}\mid BB)\times P(BB)}{P(B_{T})}}} }     Assume that the probability of being born on a Tuesday is ε ( ε = 1 / 7 will be set after arriving at the general solution). The first term in the numerator is therefore the probability of at least one boy born on Tuesday, given that the family has two boys, or 1 − (1 − ε ) 2 (one minus the probability that neither boy is born on Tuesday). The second term in the numerator is simply 1 / 4 , the probability of having two boys. The denominator is trickier; the required probability is that of having at least one boy on Tuesday over the entire sample space (two-child families). Therefore there are 4 cases to evaluate: BB, BG, GB, GG. Each of these occurs with probability 1 / 4 . P(B T (GG)) is 0, there are no boys. P(B T (BG)) and P(B T (GB)) is ε , there is one and only one boy, thus he has ε chance of being born on Tuesday. P(B T (BB)) is ε + ε − ε 2 . It is the chance that one boy is born on Tuesday, plus the chance that the other boy is born on Tuesday, minus the chance that they both are (this term arises from the fact that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A)P(B), assuming that A and B are independent). Therefore, the full equation is:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =      (   1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2     )   ×    1  4      0  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4     (   ε  +  ε  −   ε   2     )      =     1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2      4  ε  −   ε   2         {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {\left(1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}\right)\times {\frac {1}{4}}}{0+{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\left(\varepsilon +\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}\right)}}={\frac {1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}}{4\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}}}}      For     ε  >  0    {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0}   , this reduces to      P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =     2  −  ε    4  −  ε       {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {2-\varepsilon }{4-\varepsilon }}}     If ε is now set to 1 / 7 , the probability becomes 13 / 27 , or about 0.48. In fact, as ε approaches 0, the total probability goes to 1 / 2 , which is the answer expected when one child is sampled (e.g. the oldest child is a boy) and is thus removed from the pool of possible children. In other words, as more and more details about the boy child are given (for instance: born on January 1), the chance that the other child is a girl approaches one half.  It seems that quite irrelevant information was introduced, yet the probability of the sex of the other child has changed dramatically from what it was before (the chance the other child was a girl was 2 / 3 , when it was not known that the boy was born on Tuesday).  However, is it really plausible that the family with at least one boy born on a Tuesday was produced by choosing just one of such families at random? It is much more easy to imagine the following scenario.   We know Mr. Smith has two children. We knock at his door and a boy comes and answers the door. We ask the boy on what day of the week he was born.   Assume that which of the two children answers the door is determined by chance. Then the procedure was ( 1 ) pick a two-child family at random from all two-child families ( 2 ) pick one of the two children at random, ( 3 ) see if it is a boy and ask on what day he was born. The chance the other child is a girl is 1 / 2 . This is a very different procedure from ( 1 ) picking a two-child family at random from all families with two children, at least one a boy, born on a Tuesday. The chance the family consists of a boy and a girl is 14 / 27 , about 0.52.  This variant of the boy and girl problem is discussed on many internet blogs and is the subject of a paper by Ruma Falk. [14] The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.  Psychological investigation [ edit ]  From the position of statistical analysis the relevant question is often ambiguous and as such there is no “correct” answer. However, this does not exhaust the boy or girl paradox for it is not necessarily the ambiguity that explains how the intuitive probability is derived. A survey such as vos Savant's suggests that the majority of people adopt an understanding of Gardner's problem that if they were consistent would lead them to the 1 / 3 probability answer but overwhelmingly people intuitively arrive at the 1 / 2 probability answer. Ambiguity notwithstanding, this makes the problem of interest to psychological researchers who seek to understand how humans estimate probability.  Fox & Levav (2004) used the problem (called the Mr. Smith problem , credited to Gardner, but not worded exactly the same as Gardner's version) to test theories of how people estimate conditional probabilities. [2] In this study, the paradox was posed to participants in two ways:   "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' Given this information, what is the probability that the other child is a boy?"  "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and it is not the case that they are both girls.' Given this information, what is the probability that both children are boys?"   The authors argue that the first formulation gives the reader the mistaken impression that there are two possible outcomes for the "other child", [2] whereas the second formulation gives the reader the impression that there are four possible outcomes, of which one has been rejected (resulting in 1 / 3 being the probability of both children being boys, as there are 3 remaining possible outcomes, only one of which is that both of the children are boys). The study found that 85% of participants answered 1 / 2 for the first formulation, while only 39% responded that way to the second formulation. The authors argued that the reason people respond differently to each question (along with other similar problems, such as the Monty Hall Problem and the Bertrand's box paradox ) is because of the use of naive heuristics that fail to properly define the number of possible outcomes.
