Credit: Albert Ziganshin / Shutterstock.com     Many other planets throughout the universe probably hosted intelligent life long before Earth did, a new study suggests.  The probability of a civilization developing on a potentially habitable alien planet would have to be less than one in 10 billion trillion — or one part in 10 to the 22nd power — for humanity to be the first technologically advanced species the cosmos has ever known, according to the study.  "To me, this implies that other intelligent, technology-producing species very likely have evolved before us," said lead author Adam Frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York. [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Alien Life ]      Do you believe alien life exists elsewhere in the universe?       Yes - We may not have found them yet, but they're out there.         No - Aliens are just part of science fiction.         I'm not sure         Get Results  Share This    "Think of it this way: Before our result, you’d be considered a pessimist if you imagined the probability of evolving a civilization on a habitable planet was, say, one in a trillion," Frank said in a statement . "But even that guess — one chance in a trillion — implies that what has happened here on Earth with humanity has in fact happened about 10 billion other times over cosmic history."  In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake devised a formula to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that may exist today in the Milky Way.  Adam Frank and co-author Woodruff Sullivan of the University of Washington were interested in the odds that intelligent aliens have ever existed anywhere in the universe. So they tweaked the famous Drake equation , coming up with an "archaeological version" that doesn't take into account how long alien civilizations may last.  Frank and Sullivan also incorporated observations from NASA's Kepler space telescope and other instruments, which suggest that about 20 percent of all stars host planets in the life-friendly, "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.     The researchers then calculated the probability that Earth was the universe's first-ever abode for intelligent life, after taking into account the number of stars in the observable universe (about 20 billion trillion, according to a recent estimate).  "From a fundamental perspective, the question is, 'Has it ever happened anywhere before?'" Frank said. "Our result is the first time anyone has been able to set any empirical answer for that question, and it is astonishingly likely that we are not the only time and place that an advanced civilization has evolved."  But this doesn't mean that there are lots of intelligent aliens out there, just waiting to be contacted, the researchers stressed.  "The universe is more than 13 billion years old," Sullivan said in the same statement. "That means that even if there have been 1,000 civilizations in our own galaxy, if they live only as long as we have been around — roughly 10,000 years — then all of them are likely already extinct. And others won’t evolve until we are long gone. For us to have much chance of success in finding another 'contemporary' active technological civilization, on average they must last much longer than our present lifetime."  (The 10,000-year figure cited by Sullivan refers to humanity's development of agriculture and other "rudimentary" technologies; mankind has been capable of sending radio waves and other electromagnetic signals out into the cosmos for just a century or so.)

Credit: David Aguilar, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics     When life originates on a planet, whether Earth or a distant world, the newborn life-forms may have to overcome incredible odds to come into existence — and a new equation lays out exactly how overwhelming those odds may be.  The creators of the equation hope it can connect diverse areas of research that aim to answer long-standing questions about the origins of life, much like how the famous Drake equation pulled together research concerning communications from intelligent life.  "The idea of the equation, at some level, is to try to connect the unknown, presumably microscopic events that … give rise to the first thing that we would call a living system — to connect those microscopic components to the macroscopic fact of whether a planet has life starting on it," Caleb Scharf, an astrophysicist at Columbia University and lead author of the new work, told Space.com. [ 8 Newfound Alien Worlds Could Potentially Support Life ]  The Drake equation, originally penned by astronomer Frank Drake in the 1960s, laid out a series of terms estimating how many intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations likely exist in the Milky Way. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation in the galaxy, the fraction of planets where life emerges, and the fraction of that life that gains intelligence and the capability to broadcast its presence into space. Over the years, the equation has acted as a road map for researchers searching for communications signals created by intelligent civilizations beyond Earth. Scharf and his co-author Lee Cronin, a chemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, hope to provide a similar road map to researchers trying to work out how — and how often — life forms on a given planet.  "It came out of a moment in the field where we were trying to bring some cohesion to this study of origins of life," which is notorious for its disparate areas of focus, Scharf said. "To my mind, what this equation is trying to do, or at least trying to prompt people to think about, is how you make that connection — how do you go from some story about how life may have originated on Earth to a quantitative assessment of the probability that that happened, and what that means for life elsewhere in the universe," he said.  Series of steps  The new equation breaks down the process of abiogenesis — the formation of life from nonliving components — into a series of simpler factors. Those factors incorporate the planet's conditions, the ingredients needed to form life and the likelihood of those ingredients getting into the right configuration for life to emerge. As with the Drake equation, each of the terms is straightforward to describe, but each hides additional complexity and room for new research.  Here is the equation:       The average number of origin-of-life events for a given planet = (number of building blocks on planet) × 1/(average [mean] number of building blocks needed per "organism") × (availability of building blocks during time t) × (probability of assembly in a given time) × time.  Credit: Caleb Scharf and Lee Cronin    On the left, the equation considers the average (mean) expected number of origin-of-life events for a given planet. To get there, it takes into account the number of potential "building blocks" for life on the planet, the average number of building blocks needed to create a living system, the availability of those building blocks during a given time and the probability of that assembly happening during that time.  On Earth, building blocks for life take the form of amino acids, lipids and certain essential metals. Somewhere else, though, an entirely different set of ingredients could create enough complexity to form life — the equation doesn't assume any specific set is necessary.  "We're being kind of sneaky," Scharf said. "I think it's one of the beautiful things about it: If you write the equation this way, you don't necessarily have to worry about all the fine, fine details, but what you do do is, you start to break open the factors that you might be able to put some numbers to."  For instance, if you know the size of a planet and its composition, you can begin to estimate how many potential building blocks for life there are on the planet. To calculate whether those building blocks are actually available to form life, you'd have to know more about the conditions on the planet, such as its temperature, which could render some of the blocks unusable or inaccessible.  For example, these blocks could be unusable or inaccessible if they're always in gaseous form or if water is not readily available — although future research might show that life could emerge in more scenarios than scientists currently know about.  In that way, the equation "links where people in exoplanetary science may actually begin to get some data, on the size of planets, the composition, and so on, to the piece that we still don't really understand but we know must have some kind of probability of happening": how it is that life first begins, Scharf said.  A trillion test tubes  The value P a , which is the probability that life will assemble out of those particular building blocks over a given time, is murkier — and much more interesting. If the value of P a is very low, it's extremely unlikely that life will form even when the ingredients are there — potentially explaining why humans haven't yet happened to create life in the lab , even if scientists have used the right ingredients, Scharf said. But a planet-wide "lab" would increase the odds that life-creating events will occur.  "We might have to wait 100 million years for it to fall into place just in a test tube," Scharf said. "Whereas on a planet scale, you've got a trillion test tubes — probably even more than that. It's conceivable that, using this equation, playing these games, is hinting at a possible explanation for why we haven't seen life miraculously appearing in our laboratories, that … there's some subtle thing that has to happen that really doesn't happen often."  And if the scale is larger than planetary, Scharf said, that could further increase the likelihood of life forming. Early Earth and Mars, for example, were cultivating their own, separate chemistries, but the early solar system was chaotic ; impacts with other solar system bodies could have resulted in material exchanges between the two planets. That would have led to even more "test tubes" — the chemical mixing could have allowed even more interactions to occur, potentially hitting the right combination, Scharf said.  If multiple planets exchange materials, it could lead to a sort of "chemical amplification [that] could, in principle, be hugely important," he said. "It could be all the difference between getting life to occur or not, especially when we're dealing with such tiny, tiny probabilities on the microscopic scale of something going right," he added.  Factoring our ignorance  Scharf hopes that the new equation can bring together the different areas of research that relate to each of the equation's terms. For instance, the equation provides an opportunity to combine detailed examinations of far-off exoplanets, chemical research about how different molecules in different physical states can interact to generate complexity, and investigations of the smallest possible units that can exhibit living traits. Combining these areas of research, in turn, could help to link scientists' large-scale understanding of exoplanets to the microscopic chemical interactions, Scharf said.  "It's not an answer; it's a new tool for trying to think about the issues involved," Ed Turner, an astronomer at Princeton University, told Space.com. Turner was not involved in the work, but the paper's definition of the left-hand probability — the expected number of origin-of-life events — draws heavily from his work to allow for incorporating scientists' uncertainty about the origins of life based on observations of life on Earth (and how much weight to give those observations ).  "To really put numbers on those, to think very specifically about a lot of the factors in their equation, will require a lot more knowledge about exoplanets than we have now," Turner said. "We may be decades off from being able to talk about things like the total mass of building blocks on a planet's surface and things like that."  Turner pointed out that the same was true about the Drake equation: Scientists have been able to quantify only some of the terms recently, such as the number of potentially habitable planets. Therefore, the equation could become more useful as the science progresses, he said. In the meantime, it can act to "divide our ignorance into different factors" and focus research on those different components, Turner added. [ The Father of SETI: Q&A with Astronomer Frank Drake ]  But some of the factors — especially biological ones, such as the switch from nonliving to living organisms — may not be understood anytime soon, he said.  Paul Davies, an astrobiologist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study, also said that the term that incorporates the probability of nonlife becoming life will be among the hardest to define.  "We don't know the mechanism whereby nonlife turns into life, so we have no way of estimating the odds … It may be one in a trillion trillion (it's easy to imagine that), in which case, Earth life may be unique in the observable universe," Davies told Space.com in an email. "But P a may be quite large. We simply can't say."  "Setting that aside, I think the remaining terms are discussed in a very useful way as a conceptual framework for research," he added.  To get a grip on that probability, humanity would have to encounter another instance of life's emergence beyond our own for comparison. Future observatories that can see exoplanets in more detail, like the James Webb Space Telescope , may be able to detect signatures from life in earlier forms than Drake might have thought we'd spot — life on the microscopic scale rather than life actively communicating with humanity. That kind of data could help illustrate what other forms life can take.  The work also mentions the possibility of life arising multiple times using different building blocks — for instance, that some form of life that previously existed on Earth, or one that exists currently but is unknown to science, came into being separately from our brand of life with a totally different chemical vocabulary. Davies said that a good step toward narrowing down the likelihood would be to investigate Earth's own organisms for evidence of this possibility.  "We just need one other sample of life (second genesis) and the field is transformed, because we would know P a can't be exceedingly small," Davies said. "And that sample might be right here on Earth. Frankly, almost nobody has looked."  The new work was detailed July 4 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Where are they? (ESO/José Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org))    By Dirk Schulze-Makuch    airspacemag.com   May 3, 2016         For decades the famous Drake Equation has been used to estimate the number of technologically advanced species in the universe. Now Adam Frank from the University of Rochester and Woody Sullivan from the University of Washington take a slightly different approach to the problem and suggest a modification of the Drake Equation . Instead of estimating how many civilizations are out there to communicate with today, they estimate how many civilizations have been out there since the beginning of the Universe.     At first glance this seems to be only a slight semantic difference, but it is not. A big unknown in the original Drake Equation is the average lifetime of a civilization during which they might be available to communicate with us. This window might be very short, especially if technological species are typically replaced by machines . Or it could be very long.   Reframing the question makes longevity a moot point. Frank and Sullivan ask: What is the chance that we are the only technological species and always have been ? If we put the question this way, the Drake Equation boils down to A = N ast * f bt , where A is the number of technological species that have ever formed over the history of the observable universe, N ast are all the astronomical unknowns (which we now have a much better handle on than we did in 1961), and f bt are the biological unknowns, which are still many—including the fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears, the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life emerges, and the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.   Based on recent exoplanet discoveries , Frank and Sullivan assume that one-fifth of all stars have habitable planets in orbit around them. This leads them to conclude that there should be other advanced technological civilization out there, unless the chance for developing such a civilization on a habitable planet in the observable universe is less than 1 in 10 24 (a 1 with 24 zeros!). For our own Milky Way galaxy, the odds of being the only technologically advanced civilization are 1 in 60 billion. Thus, it’s very likely that other intelligent, technologically advanced species evolved before us. Even if only one in every million stars hosts a technologically advanced species today, that would still yield a total of about 300,000 such civilizations in the whole galaxy.   The Archilles’ heel of these statistical estimates is of course the biological uncertainties; Earth is still the only planet where we know life exists. The appearance of life may be extremely unlikely, and so might the evolution of technology. After all, there are many intelligent species on our planet, including dolphins, octopi, apes, parrots, and elephants, but only once in 4.6 billion years has a technologically advanced species evolved. And life cannot have appeared in the very early Universe until heavier elements produced by the explosions of many supernovas became abundant.   Still, Frank and Sullivan think their 1 in 10 24 estimate constitutes a “pessimism line”—a lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species has evolved over time. And that’s good news for SETI, even if it doesn’t help us know where to look.     Like this article?

A:  Earth is considered to be in area known as the “Goldilocks Zone” around our Sun. It is just the right distance away from our Sun to allow just the right amount of air, water and heat to support life.    Earth is not the only planet known to have conditions favorable to life. Exoplanets , planets outside our Solar System, have been found in the Goldilocks Zones of other stars in our galaxy. A lot of research is under way to find other Earth-like planets so who knows? We might discover life on other planets within our lifetimes.

For other uses, see Drake equation (disambiguation) .     Dr. Frank Drake    The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way  galaxy . [1] [2] The number of such civilizations N , is assumed to be equal to the mathematical product of    R ∗ , the average rate of star formations, in our galaxy,  f p , the fraction of formed stars that have planets,  n e for stars that have planets, the average number of planets that can potentially support life,  f l , the fraction of those planets that actually develop life,  f i , the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, has developed,  f c , the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and  L , the length of time over which such civilizations release detectable signals,    for a combined expression of:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     The equation was written in 1961 by Frank Drake , not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). [3] [4] The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. [3] It is more properly thought of as a Fermi problem rather than as a serious attempt to nail down a precise number.  Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

[5] [6] Cocconi and Morrison argued that radio telescopes had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a wavelength of 21 cm (1,420.4 MHz ). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral hydrogen , the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the radio spectrum .  Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor Harlow Shapley speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution." [7]  Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. Using the 25 m dish of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia , Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti . In this project, which he called Project Ozma , he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21 cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960. [6] The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It was also unsuccessful.  Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a " search for extraterrestrial intelligence " meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting. [8]   As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms. —Frank Drake.   The ten attendees were conference organizer J. Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, Philip Morrison , businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist Melvin Calvin , astronomer Su-Shu Huang , neuroscientist John C. Lilly , inventor Barney Oliver , astronomer Carl Sagan and radio-astronomer Otto Struve . [9] These participants dubbed themselves " The Order of the Dolphin " (because of Lilly's work on dolphin communication ), and commemorated their first meeting with a plaque at the observatory hall. [10] [11]  Equation [ edit ]  The Drake equation is:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     where:   N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone );   and   R ∗ = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy  f p = the fraction of those stars that have planets  n e = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets  f l = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point  f i = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)  f c = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space  L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space [12] [13]   Usefulness [ edit ]     The Allen Telescope Array for SETI    The Drake equation amounts to a summary of the factors affecting the likelihood that we might detect radio-communication from intelligent extraterrestrial life. [1] [12] [14] The last four parameters, f l , f i , f c , and L , are not known and are very difficult to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see criticism ). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation of all the various concepts which scientists must incorporate when considering the question of life elsewhere, [1] [3] and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for scientific analysis . The Drake equation is a statement that stimulates intellectual curiosity about the universe around us, for helping us to understand that life as we know it is the end product of a natural, cosmic evolution, and for helping us realize how much we are a part of that universe. [13] What the equation and the search for life has done is focus science on some of the other questions about life in the universe, specifically abiogenesis , the development of multi-cellular life and the development of intelligence itself. [15]  Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question. [1] It also formed the backbone of astrobiology as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories . Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21 cm hydrogen frequency . No one could say this in 1961. [16]  Modifications [ edit ]  As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters, [17] and many changes and modifications to the equation have been proposed. One line of modification, for example, attempts to account for the uncertainty inherent in many of the terms. [18]  Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations. For example, David Brin states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society". [19] Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.   Colonization  It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other star systems . Each original site expands with an expansion velocity v , and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime L . The result is a more complex set of 3 equations. [19]    Reappearance factor  The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by how many times an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next civilization to evolve . Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if n r is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be 1 + n r , which is the actual reappearance factor added to the equation.    The factor depends on what generally is the cause of civilization extinction . If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a nuclear winter , then n r may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as stellar evolution , then n r may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for f l , that is, how many times life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.    METI factor  Alexander Zaitsev said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation. [20] He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.    The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.    Biogenic gases  Astronomer Sara Seager proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. [21] These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes. [22]    The Seager equation looks like this: [22] [a]       N  =   N   ∗    ⋅   F    Q     ⋅   F    H  Z     ⋅   F    O     ⋅   F    L     ⋅   F    S       {\displaystyle N=N_{*}\cdot F_{\mathrm {Q} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {HZ} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {O} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {L} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {S} }}      where:      N = the number of planets with detectable signs of life  N ∗ = the number of stars observed  F Q = the fraction of stars that are quiet  F HZ = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone  F O = the fraction of those planets that can be observed  F L = the fraction that have life  F S = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas     Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?” [23]  Estimates [ edit ]  Original estimates [ edit ]  There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were: [24] [25]   R ∗ = 1 yr −1 (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)  f p = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)  n e = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)  f l = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)  f i = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)  f c = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)  L = 1000 to 100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)   Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: Range of results ). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that N ≈ L , and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  Current estimates [ edit ]  This section discusses and attempts to list the best current estimates for the parameters of the Drake equation.  Rate of star creation in our galaxy, R ∗ [ edit ]  Latest calculations from NASA and the European Space Agency indicate that the current rate of star formation in our galaxy is about 0.68–1.45 M ☉ of material per year. [26] [27] To get the number of stars per year, this must account for the initial mass function (IMF) for stars, where the average new star mass is about 0.5 M ☉ . [28] This gives a star formation rate of about 1.5–3 stars per year.   Fraction of those stars that have planets, f p [ edit ]  Recent analysis of microlensing surveys has found that f p may approach 1—that is, stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception; and that there are one or more bound planets per Milky Way star. [29] [30]  Average number of planets per star having planets that might support life, n e [ edit ]  In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized  planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy . [31] [32] 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars. [33] Since there are about 100 billion stars in the galaxy, this implies f p · n e is roughly 0.4. The nearest planet in the habitable zone may be as close as 12 light-years away, according to the scientists. [31] [32]  The consensus at the Green Bank meeting was that n e had a minimum value between 3 and 5. Dutch astronomer Govert Schilling has opined that this is optimistic. [34] Even if planets are in the habitable zone , the number of planets with the right proportion of elements is difficult to estimate. [35] Brad Gibson, Yeshe Fenner, and Charley Lineweaver determined that about 10% of star systems in the Milky Way galaxy are hospitable to life, by having heavy elements, being far from supernovae and being stable for a sufficient time. [36]  The discovery of numerous gas giants in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called hot Jupiters may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.  On the other hand, the variety of star systems that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to red dwarf stars might have habitable zones , [37] although the flaring behavior of these stars might argue against this. [38] The possibility of life on moons of gas giants (such as Jupiter 's moon Europa , or Saturn 's moon Titan ) adds further uncertainty to this figure. [39]  The authors of the rare Earth hypothesis propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a hot Jupiter ; and a planet with plate tectonics , a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate axial tilt to generate seasonal variation. [40]  Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, f l [ edit ]  Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that f l may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that abiogenesis may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains anthropic bias , as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical hypothesis testing standpoint, there are zero degrees of freedom , permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on Mars that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for f l close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.  Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for bacteria that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet. [41] It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways. Biochemists Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms." [42] As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of directed panspermia , which states that Earth life began with "microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship".  Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, f i [ edit ]  This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist Ernst Mayr , point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for f i . [43] Likewise, the Rare Earth hypothesis, notwithstanding their low value for n e above, also think a low value for f i dominates the analysis. [44] Those who favor higher values note the generally increasing complexity of life over time, concluding that the appearance of intelligence is almost inevitable, [45] [46] implying an f i approaching 1. Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable. (See Criticism ).  In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the Cambrian explosion , in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the snowball Earth or research into the extinction events have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past life on Mars is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f l but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.  Estimates of f i have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from novae ). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation .  Fraction of the above revealing their existence via signal release into space, f c [ edit ]  For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are some efforts covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for our presence. (See Arecibo message , for example). There is considerable speculation why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than our own. [47] By this standard, the Earth is a communicating civilization.  Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a light year away. [48]  Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, L [ edit ]  Michael Shermer estimated L as 420 years, based on the duration of sixty historical Earthly civilizations. [49] Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including reappearance number , this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the reappearance number rather than increase in L , stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.  David Grinspoon has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for L potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed. [50] He proposes that the last factor L be replaced with f IC · T , where f IC is the fraction of communicating civilizations become "immortal" (in the sense that they simply do not die out), and T representing the length of time during which this process has been going on. This has the advantage that T would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.  It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other. [51]  The astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear warfare .  Range of results [ edit ]  As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions, [52] and the values used in portions of the Drake equation are not well-established. [34] [53] [54] [55] In particular, the result can be N ≪ 1 , meaning we are likely alone in the galaxy, or N ≫ 1 , implying there are many civilizations we might contact. One of the few points of wide agreement is that the presence of humanity implies a probability of intelligence arising of greater than zero. [56]  As an example of a low estimate, combining NASA's star formation rates, the rare Earth hypothesis value of f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [57] Mayr's view on intelligence arising, Drake's view of communication, and Shermer's estimate of lifetime:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [40]  f i = 10 −9 , [43]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 304 years [49]   gives:   N = 1.5 × 10 −5 × 10 −9 × 0.2 × 304 = 9.1 × 10 −11   i.e., suggesting that we are probably alone in this galaxy, and possibly in the observable universe.  On the other hand, with larger values for each of the parameters above, values of N can be derived that are greater than 1. The following higher values that have been proposed for each of the parameters:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p = 1 , [29]  n e = 0.2 , [58] [59]  f l = 0.13 , [60]  f i = 1 , [45]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 10 9 years [50]   Use of these parameters gives:   N = 3 × 1 × 0.2 × 0.13 × 1 × 0.2 × 10 9 = 15,600,000   Monte Carlo simulations of estimates of the Drake equation factors based on a stellar and planetary model of the Milky Way have resulted in the number of civilizations varying by a factor of 100. [61]  Has intelligent life ever existed? [ edit ]  The Drake equation can be modified to determine just how unlikely intelligent life must be, to give the result that Earth has the only intelligent life that has ever arisen, either in our galaxy or the universe as a whole. This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ever develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than 6976250000000000000♠ 2.5 × 10 −24 . Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than 6989170000000000000♠ 1.7 × 10 −11 (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66]  Criticism [ edit ]  Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture. Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics. No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known. The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful. [67]  One reply to such criticisms [68] is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference. [69]  Fermi paradox [ edit ]  Main article: Fermi paradox  The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact. [6] A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years might be able to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology . Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been recognized as such, either in our galaxy or in the observable universe of 2 trillion galaxies. [70] [71] According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?". [72] [73]  A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations. [74] In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:   Few intelligent civilizations ever arise. This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, R ∗ · f p · n e · f l · f i , has a low value. The most common suspect is f i , but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that n e is the small term.  Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning f c is small. Typical arguments include that civilizations are too far apart , it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy , civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time , it is dangerous to communicate , and many others.  The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of L is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself , it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others , they tend to experience a technological singularity , and others.   These lines of reasoning lead to the Great Filter hypothesis, [75] which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.  In fiction and popular culture [ edit ]  The equation was cited by Gene Roddenberry as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on Star Trek , the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal. [76] The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:         F   f   2    (  M  g  E  )  −   C   1    R   i   1    ⋅  M  =  L   /   S  o    {\displaystyle Ff^{2}(MgE)-C^{1}Ri^{1}\cdot M=L/So}       However, a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.

(Intermediate)     (Intermediate)      I was just curious....do the gas giant planets (Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn) have at least a thin band of oxygen in the atmosphere which would make it possible to live in the sky???? (floating cities)  There is only one planet where gaseous oxygen is found: Earth! And the only reason that Earth has oxygen is because Earth has plants that do photosynthesis. There is no other natural process that we know of that will put significant amounts of oxygen into a planet's atmosphere.  So that is bad news if you'd like to live on another planet in our Solar System. However, it does mean that if we ever find a planet around another star that has oxygen in its atmosphere, we can be fairly confident that there is life of some kind on that planet.

By Brian Koberlein in Science Wire | Space  |  February 3, 2016     The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and prompting speculation – and these musings – about advanced aliens.       Our sun is located about two-thirds of the way out from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There are 100 billion suns in our Milky Way. Illustration via Caltech.  Recently the star KIC 8462852 (aka Tabby’s Star) has made news again because of its strange behavior. Possible explanations for its varying brightness (such as comets) don’t seem to fit the observational data, which has some speculating that the star’s behavior could be explained by the presence of an alien civilization. While many astronomers admit that is a possibility, they don’t think aliens are the likely cause. For one, mysterious behavior is not enough to conclude the cause is aliens . For another, the likelihood that an alien civilization actually exists is still a matter of some debate.  The odds of an alien civilization coexisting with humans is often calculated by the Drake equation . It was first proposed by Frank Drake in 1961. Simply take the rate at which stars form in our galaxy and multiply it by the fraction of stars with planets, the average number of planets per star that could support life, the fraction of those that actually develop life, the fraction of life bearing planets that develop civilization, the fraction of civilizations that have detectible signals, and finally the length of time a civilization might last. Crunch the numbers and you have the number of civilizations in our galaxy capable of communicating with us.  When Drake first proposed the equation, the values for each term were largely unknown, but we now have good estimates for many of them. We know that most stars have planets, and the odds of a potentially habitable planet is actually quite high, possibly as high as 100 billion in our galaxy alone.  Unfortunately the really important factors of the Drake equation are still completely unknown. On how many potentially habitable planets does life actually arise? How many of those give rise to civilizations? How long does a typical civilization last? No idea. Depending on the answer to those questions the number of civilizations in our galaxy could range from hundreds of thousands to only one.  The equation was never intended to give an absolute number, though it is often used that way. There are also alternatives such as the Sara Seager’s equation , which focuses on our ability to detect civilizations indirectly rather than requiring active communication. Just because an alien civilization is quiet, that doesn’t mean we can’t see evidence for them. Seager’s approach is to focus on stable red dwarf stars with known potentially habitable worlds. Since red dwarf stars are by far the most common, the odds that we’d find alien life near such a star is higher. She then focuses on planets that transit their home star from our vantage point and are near enough that we have a chance of observing the effects of the planet’s atmosphere on the star’s light. She estimates that there might be two inhabited worlds might be detectable in the next ten years.  Of course this presumes that life forms readily on a habitable planet and survives billions of years, which might not be the case .  The famous Drake equation, formulated by Frank Drake in the 1960s. It brings together key factors to consider when estimating the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy.  What make’s Tabby’s Star particularly interesting is that it hints at being evidence of an artificial structure the size of a solar system, such as a Dyson sphere, which is something only highly advanced civilizations could create. Of course the big underlying assumption here is that the more advanced a civilization is, the more likely it will build such a structure. The idea was first presented by Nikolai Kardashev in 1964 , who proposed a classification of civilizations based upon their energy use. Type I civilizations harness the resources of their home planet, such as humans today. Type II harness almost the full energy of their home star, possibly through technology such as Dyson spheres. Species within the Star Trek universe would typically be Type II. Type III are civilizations that can harness the energy of an entire galaxy, such as the Asgard of the Stargate universe.  Carl Sagan later generalized the Kardashev scale to a logarithmic function of energy use, and estimated that we were at about 0.7.  The Kardashev scale presumes that more advanced civilizations will necessarily demand more energy. Humans have so far lent credence to this idea, since our modern global civilization consumes much more energy than earlier agrarian civilizations. If our human population and demands for technological convenience grows, we will likely expand out into the solar system with a continued rise in energy consumption.  But such a future is not guaranteed. It’s also possible that we will instead reach a stable and sustainable population level, and combined with increasing energy efficiency our energy consumption may flatten. Technological civilizations may stabilize at type I rather than continuing up the scale.  That’s the real challenge with calculating the odds.  Everything we’ve pinned down so far point to a good chance that life forms on planets across the universe … but there’s still too many unknowns.  Even NASA has toyed with the idea of large space habitats. This is a painting of what one might look like on the inside, by space artist Don Davis.  Bottom line: The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and causing speculation about advanced aliens. However, now – as in 1961, when Frank Drake formulated his famous Drake equation – the fact is that there are many unknowns, and we don’t know if our galaxy has numerous advanced civilizations … or one.

Home     Astronomy & Space      Astronomy     May 9, 2016     What are the chances of life on another planet?  May 9, 2016, Tufts University                 In an infinite universe, most scientists agree, the odds of life existing on a planet besides Earth are pretty high. It is unlikely, however, that familiar life forms will be found on any planet within our solar system. Life as we know it—everything from single-celled organisms to human beings—consists largely of liquid water. So a planet that harbors life can't be too cold or water will freeze, nor can it be too hot or all the water will evaporate. Planets closer to the sun than Earth are too hot, and those farther away are too cold. The surface of Venus, for example, is hot enough to melt lead, and would vaporize any living thing, while the surface of Mars is frozen solid.        Life as we know it here on Earth also requires a magnetic field and an atmosphere, both of which protect it from the lethal radiation our parent star, the sun, emits. Earth's magnetic field—generated by its rotating iron core—deflects the solar wind, a continuous stream of high-speed, high-energy particles coming out of the sun. (As those particles careen by the edges of Earth's atmosphere, they sometime create the phenomenon we call the Northern Lights.) Without the magnetic field there, the solar wind might destroy all life on Earth.  As for Earth's atmosphere, it protects life because the water, carbon dioxide and other gases in it absorb solar radiation in its harmful ultraviolet-light form. The parent stars of other solar systems would emit radiation as well, and the planets orbiting them would need the same kind of protection.  Of course, life on Earth also alters the chemical composition of the atmosphere—Earth's atmosphere lacked gaseous oxygen until plants started growing here some million years ago. So molecules like oxygen in the atmosphere of another planet would be one indication—not proof—that there are living things there.  Scientists have been studying the planets of our own solar system for more than 50 years, looking for evidence of past or present life, among other things. Launched in 1967, the Soviet Union's Venera 4 was the first probe known to land on and send back data from another planet. The mission revealed that Venus' famously soupy atmosphere is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide with a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, making it a very unlikely place to harbor life.  Today, NASA's Mars rover, Opportunity, has been sending back reams of data about the red planet since it landed there 12 years ago. Living well past all expectations, Opportunity not only transmits landscape photos and the occasional tweet, but also collects and analyzes soil and atmosphere samples. It's been an invaluable research tool, but has found no direct evidence that life ever existed on Mars, and has revealed that the planet's atmosphere is too thin to protect it from the sun's radiation.  The discovery of thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars has nevertheless greatly increased speculation that there may be some kind of life on a planet outside our solar system. In the past 20 years, we have confirmed the discovery of almost 2,000 planets, called exoplanets, beyond our solar system. Four thousand other exoplanet candidates await confirmation.  The ones most likely to harbor life would be smallish, rocky planets like Earth. Larger planets tend to be composed of hydrogen gas, the most abundant element in the universe, and to not have a solid surface. Good candidates for life would also occupy what scientists call the habitable zone—the zone in which a planet's distance from the parent star makes liquid water possible. The Kepler mission —a space observatory launched by NASA in 1997 to search our galaxy for just these kinds of Earth-like planets—has found one candidate that meets both requirements, Kepler-452b. So the chances of life on another planet are high. However, we have no direct evidence yet of life anywhere other than Earth.  The real question is, will we ever find the planet we're looking for, given that we'll have to survey the planetary systems of the universe's estimated 1 billion trillion stars? And if we do find that planet, will we even recognize the life it harbors? There's no real reason why we should expect to discover life as we know it orbiting a star many light years away from our home solar system . There's so much we don't know that we are severely limited in our ability to even think about the question.

I guess with dark mater and dark energy out of the picture, it leaves us with 4% of the universe. And what percent of that 4% do we know for sure and really understand? Just a totally wild guess here .5% So what does that leave us? 99.5% we don't know yet? It's funny how many intelligent people can deduce from that .5% things like --- There is no other intelligent beings out there. (Should be qualified with "I don't think") There is no God. (You would think if they were really intelligent based on that .5% they would be agnostic.) The list goes on and on with our arrogant beliefs, based on .5%. I am not sure how much more percentage wise we know than a ant. :-)       ogg_ogg     2.3 / 5 (3)  May 09, 2016    Unless life exists within a couple thousand light-years of us, we'll (probably) never know. So, the actual number of potential planets is NOT "billions" or even millions. A "frequency based" probability measure shouldn't be used with only one data point (life here). Bayesian estimates require knowledge we. do. not. have. (yet). It is just speculation that a planet without a magnetic field can't support life. The "life-as-we-know-it" qualification is appropriate, but the assumption that life requires hospitable SURFACE conditions is NOT.  This article is pseudo-scientific rubbish. Other errors I'll mention (it is full of them) is that the Earth's early atmosphere did not "lack" oxygen, but it is believed that there was little present (as O2). We've evidence that life existed 3.6 bya, but it is an assumption that it has existed ever since then, that it only arose here once. Maybe, maybe not. Finally, it is nonsense to discuss an "infinite" Universe. see Boltzmann Brain.       ogg_ogg     1 / 5 (2)  May 09, 2016    since Bayesian probability calculations allow any a priori Probability to be used, I should have written something like "credibly reliable Bayesian estimates require knowledge we. do. not. have.

We have every reason to suspect we can observe life as we know it (say, an oxygenated atmosphere) soon. @rderkis; The beauty of the standard cosmology is that it let us know 100 % of the universe content. More importantly here is that we do know the laws underlying everyday life. There is a brand new paper that shows that we should expect other intelligences out there, because it becomes so unlikely not to have more. (Too many planets.) Also, we do know at least 10 similar planets will happen, because the current number of planets is ~ 7 %  of the total number there will eventually be,        Please sign in to add a comment.

Kenneth R. Lang, a professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, explains The discovery of thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars has greatly increased speculation that there may be some kind of life on a planet outside our solar system. Photo: Ingimage May 6, 2016 Share     Print Email In an infinite universe, most scientists agree, the odds of life existing on a planet besides Earth are pretty high. It is unlikely, however, that familiar life forms will be found on any planet within our solar system. Life as we know it—everything from single-celled organisms to human beings—consists largely of liquid water. So a planet that harbors life can’t be too cold or water will freeze, nor can it be too hot or all the water will evaporate. Planets closer to the sun than Earth are too hot, and those farther away are too cold. The surface of Venus, for example, is hot enough to melt lead, and would vaporize any living thing, while the surface of Mars is frozen solid.  Life as we know it here on Earth also requires a magnetic field and an atmosphere, both of which protect it from the lethal radiation our parent star, the sun, emits. Earth’s magnetic field—generated by its rotating iron core—deflects the solar wind, a continuous stream of high-speed, high-energy particles coming out of the sun. (As those particles careen by the edges of Earth’s atmosphere, they sometime create the phenomenon we call the Northern Lights.) Without the magnetic field there, the solar wind might destroy all life on Earth.  As for Earth’s atmosphere, it protects life because the water, carbon dioxide and other gases in it absorb solar radiation in its harmful ultraviolet-light form. The parent stars of other solar systems would emit radiation as well, and the planets orbiting them would need the same kind of protection.  Of course, life on Earth also alters the chemical composition of the atmosphere—Earth’s atmosphere lacked gaseous oxygen until about a billion years ago, when first algae and then plants began growing here and producing it. So molecules like oxygen in the atmosphere of another planet would be one indication—not proof—that there are living things there.  Scientists have been studying the planets of our own solar system for more than 50 years, looking for evidence of past or present life, among other things. Launched in 1967, the Soviet Union’s Venera 4 was the first probe known to land on and send back data from another planet. The mission revealed that Venus’ famously soupy atmosphere is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide with a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, making it a very unlikely place to harbor life.  Today, NASA’s Mars rover, Opportunity , has been sending back reams of data about the red planet since it landed there 12 years ago. Living well past all expectations, Opportunity not only transmits landscape photos and the occasional tweet , but also collects and analyzes soil and atmosphere samples. It’s been an invaluable research tool, but has found no direct evidence that life ever existed on Mars, and has revealed that the planet’s atmosphere is too thin to protect it from the sun’s radiation.  The discovery of thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars has nevertheless greatly increased speculation that there may be some kind of life on a planet outside our solar system. In the past 20 years, we have confirmed the discovery of almost 2,000 planets, called exoplanets, beyond our solar system. Four thousand other exoplanet candidates await confirmation.  The ones most likely to harbor life would be smallish, rocky planets like Earth. Larger planets tend to be composed of hydrogen gas, the most abundant element in the universe, and to not have a solid surface. Good candidates for life would also occupy what scientists call the habitable zone—the zone in which a planet’s distance from the parent star makes liquid water possible. The Kepler mission —a space observatory launched by NASA in 1997 to search our galaxy for just these kinds of Earth-like planets—has found one candidate that meets both requirements, Kepler-452b. So the chances of life on another planet are high. However, we have no direct evidence yet of life anywhere other than Earth.  The real question is, will we ever find the planet we’re looking for, given that we’ll have to survey the planetary systems of the universe’s estimated 100 octillion (a 1 with 29 zeros after it) stars? And if we do find that planet, will we even recognize the life it harbors? There’s no real reason why we should expect to discover life as we know it orbiting a star many light years away from our home solar system. There’s so much we don’t know that we are severely limited in our ability to even think about the question.

The spiral galaxy NGC 4845, located over 65 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo (The Virgin) is shown in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image released on January 8, 2016.   REUTERS/NASA        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     What are the odds that intelligent life evolved on Earth and nowhere else among the 20 billion trillion stars in the observable universe across 13.8 billion years of cosmic history? About one in 10 billion trillion, according to researchers writing in the journal Astrobiology -- meaning it's very, very unlikely humanity is unique across the sweep of cosmic space and time. Put another way, even if life evolves on only one planet in a billion orbiting in the habitable zone of its star -- the region where water can exist as a liquid and life as it's known on Earth could, in theory, evolve -- "that still means it's happened on the order of 10 trillion times," said Adam Frank, an astronomer at the University of Rochester. Armed with data from NASA's Kepler space telescope showing planets are commonplace, Frank and Woodruff Sullivan, an astronomer at the University of Washington, decided to take a fresh look at the Drake equation , developed in 1961 by astrophysicist Frank Drake as a way of making a rough estimate of how common technological civilizations might be across the Milky Way galaxy. The Drake equation combines three terms from astronomy -- the frequency of star formation, the fraction of those stars that host planets, and the number of planets with environments suitable for life -- with three "biological" terms -- the fraction of such planets with life of any sort, the fraction that might have developed intelligent life, and the number of civilizations capable of making their presence known across interstellar distances. A seventh term indicates how long civilizations might maintain the technology needed to make their presence known. Because the three biological terms are simply unknowns, one can plug in whatever values one wishes depending on whether one is an optimist who believes life is common across the universe or one is more pessimistic. In any case, because the reality of extra-solar planets was not known when the Drake equation was first constructed, not to mention habitable-zone planets, it offered little in the way of concrete answers. The elements of the original Drake equation, constructed in 1961 to serve as a starting point for discussions about the likelihood of intelligent life in the cosmos, is shown compared to a modified version that allows researchers to estimate the odds that Earth is unique in the universe. As it turns out, the odds are unimaginably low. University of Rochester Click on the illustration above to expand. But with data from the Kepler space telescope, Frank and Woodruff decided to come at the Drake equation from a different angle. "All the terms in the Drake equation that have to do with astronomy are now nailed, whereas when I started (out in astronomy 25 years ago) the two (terms) about planets were completely unknown," Frank said in an interview. "So we took that and we changed the question. Instead of asking how many civilizations exist right now for us to communicate with, we asked how many have ever existed?" By asking that question, "we could use this new data (from Kepler) to set a firm limit ... on whether or not we're the only civilization. We can give you the probability, what the probability would have to be per habitable planet, in order for us to be the only time in the universe that a civilization arose." First, they eliminated the time element in the original Drake equation, allowing their analysis to cover the entire history of the cosmos from the Big Bang forward. Then, they combined the three astronomy terms into one known factor and the three biology terms into a single unknown. The revised equation then reads: A = Nf where A is the number of intelligent, technological civilizations, N is the now known astronomical data and f represents the unknown biological elements. By setting A equal to 1 -- humans on Earth -- and plugging in the known values for N, Frank and Sullivan simply solved for the unknown, f. "We took all the probabilities that have to do with life ... we combined them into one term, which we called the biotechnical probability," Frank said. "We have no idea what those values are. Instead of trying to guess them, we solved for them. We took what we knew and solved for the value, how low would it have to be in order for us to be the only time it ever happened?" As it turns out, very, very low. "If I have a bag of planets, and these are planets in the right place to form life, how many of those do I have to sort through before I get to one that has a civilization like ours on it?" Frank asked. "In order for us to be the only time that this has ever happened in the entire history of the universe, we'd have to go through 10 billion trillion before we'd get one like us." A paper explaining the calculations and results, titled "A New Empirical Constraint on the Prevalence of Technological Species in the Universe," is available in the journal Astrobiology .   © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

For other uses, see Drake equation (disambiguation) .     Dr. Frank Drake    The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way  galaxy . [1] [2] The number of such civilizations N , is assumed to be equal to the mathematical product of    R ∗ , the average rate of star formations, in our galaxy,  f p , the fraction of formed stars that have planets,  n e for stars that have planets, the average number of planets that can potentially support life,  f l , the fraction of those planets that actually develop life,  f i , the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, has developed,  f c , the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and  L , the length of time over which such civilizations release detectable signals,    for a combined expression of:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     The equation was written in 1961 by Frank Drake , not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). [3] [4] The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. [3] It is more properly thought of as a Fermi problem rather than as a serious attempt to nail down a precise number.  Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

[5] [6] Cocconi and Morrison argued that radio telescopes had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a wavelength of 21 cm (1,420.4 MHz ). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral hydrogen , the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the radio spectrum .  Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor Harlow Shapley speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution." [7]  Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. Using the 25 m dish of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia , Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti . In this project, which he called Project Ozma , he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21 cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960. [6] The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It was also unsuccessful.  Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a " search for extraterrestrial intelligence " meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting. [8]   As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms. —Frank Drake.   The ten attendees were conference organizer J. Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, Philip Morrison , businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist Melvin Calvin , astronomer Su-Shu Huang , neuroscientist John C. Lilly , inventor Barney Oliver , astronomer Carl Sagan and radio-astronomer Otto Struve . [9] These participants dubbed themselves " The Order of the Dolphin " (because of Lilly's work on dolphin communication ), and commemorated their first meeting with a plaque at the observatory hall. [10] [11]  Equation [ edit ]  The Drake equation is:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     where:   N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone );   and   R ∗ = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy  f p = the fraction of those stars that have planets  n e = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets  f l = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point  f i = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)  f c = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space  L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space [12] [13]   Usefulness [ edit ]     The Allen Telescope Array for SETI    The Drake equation amounts to a summary of the factors affecting the likelihood that we might detect radio-communication from intelligent extraterrestrial life. [1] [12] [14] The last four parameters, f l , f i , f c , and L , are not known and are very difficult to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see criticism ). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation of all the various concepts which scientists must incorporate when considering the question of life elsewhere, [1] [3] and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for scientific analysis . The Drake equation is a statement that stimulates intellectual curiosity about the universe around us, for helping us to understand that life as we know it is the end product of a natural, cosmic evolution, and for helping us realize how much we are a part of that universe. [13] What the equation and the search for life has done is focus science on some of the other questions about life in the universe, specifically abiogenesis , the development of multi-cellular life and the development of intelligence itself. [15]  Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question. [1] It also formed the backbone of astrobiology as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories . Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21 cm hydrogen frequency . No one could say this in 1961. [16]  Modifications [ edit ]  As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters, [17] and many changes and modifications to the equation have been proposed. One line of modification, for example, attempts to account for the uncertainty inherent in many of the terms. [18]  Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations. For example, David Brin states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society". [19] Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.   Colonization  It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other star systems . Each original site expands with an expansion velocity v , and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime L . The result is a more complex set of 3 equations. [19]    Reappearance factor  The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by how many times an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next civilization to evolve . Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if n r is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be 1 + n r , which is the actual reappearance factor added to the equation.    The factor depends on what generally is the cause of civilization extinction . If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a nuclear winter , then n r may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as stellar evolution , then n r may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for f l , that is, how many times life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.    METI factor  Alexander Zaitsev said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation. [20] He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.    The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.    Biogenic gases  Astronomer Sara Seager proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. [21] These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes. [22]    The Seager equation looks like this: [22] [a]       N  =   N   ∗    ⋅   F    Q     ⋅   F    H  Z     ⋅   F    O     ⋅   F    L     ⋅   F    S       {\displaystyle N=N_{*}\cdot F_{\mathrm {Q} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {HZ} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {O} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {L} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {S} }}      where:      N = the number of planets with detectable signs of life  N ∗ = the number of stars observed  F Q = the fraction of stars that are quiet  F HZ = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone  F O = the fraction of those planets that can be observed  F L = the fraction that have life  F S = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas     Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?” [23]  Estimates [ edit ]  Original estimates [ edit ]  There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were: [24] [25]   R ∗ = 1 yr −1 (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)  f p = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)  n e = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)  f l = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)  f i = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)  f c = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)  L = 1000 to 100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)   Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: Range of results ). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that N ≈ L , and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  Current estimates [ edit ]  This section discusses and attempts to list the best current estimates for the parameters of the Drake equation.  Rate of star creation in our galaxy, R ∗ [ edit ]  Latest calculations from NASA and the European Space Agency indicate that the current rate of star formation in our galaxy is about 0.68–1.45 M ☉ of material per year. [26] [27] To get the number of stars per year, this must account for the initial mass function (IMF) for stars, where the average new star mass is about 0.5 M ☉ . [28] This gives a star formation rate of about 1.5–3 stars per year.   Fraction of those stars that have planets, f p [ edit ]  Recent analysis of microlensing surveys has found that f p may approach 1—that is, stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception; and that there are one or more bound planets per Milky Way star. [29] [30]  Average number of planets per star having planets that might support life, n e [ edit ]  In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized  planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy . [31] [32] 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars. [33] Since there are about 100 billion stars in the galaxy, this implies f p · n e is roughly 0.4. The nearest planet in the habitable zone may be as close as 12 light-years away, according to the scientists. [31] [32]  The consensus at the Green Bank meeting was that n e had a minimum value between 3 and 5. Dutch astronomer Govert Schilling has opined that this is optimistic. [34] Even if planets are in the habitable zone , the number of planets with the right proportion of elements is difficult to estimate. [35] Brad Gibson, Yeshe Fenner, and Charley Lineweaver determined that about 10% of star systems in the Milky Way galaxy are hospitable to life, by having heavy elements, being far from supernovae and being stable for a sufficient time. [36]  The discovery of numerous gas giants in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called hot Jupiters may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.  On the other hand, the variety of star systems that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to red dwarf stars might have habitable zones , [37] although the flaring behavior of these stars might argue against this. [38] The possibility of life on moons of gas giants (such as Jupiter 's moon Europa , or Saturn 's moon Titan ) adds further uncertainty to this figure. [39]  The authors of the rare Earth hypothesis propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a hot Jupiter ; and a planet with plate tectonics , a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate axial tilt to generate seasonal variation. [40]  Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, f l [ edit ]  Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that f l may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that abiogenesis may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains anthropic bias , as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical hypothesis testing standpoint, there are zero degrees of freedom , permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on Mars that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for f l close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.  Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for bacteria that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet. [41] It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways. Biochemists Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms." [42] As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of directed panspermia , which states that Earth life began with "microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship".  Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, f i [ edit ]  This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist Ernst Mayr , point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for f i . [43] Likewise, the Rare Earth hypothesis, notwithstanding their low value for n e above, also think a low value for f i dominates the analysis. [44] Those who favor higher values note the generally increasing complexity of life over time, concluding that the appearance of intelligence is almost inevitable, [45] [46] implying an f i approaching 1. Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable. (See Criticism ).  In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the Cambrian explosion , in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the snowball Earth or research into the extinction events have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past life on Mars is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f l but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.  Estimates of f i have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from novae ). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation .  Fraction of the above revealing their existence via signal release into space, f c [ edit ]  For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are some efforts covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for our presence. (See Arecibo message , for example). There is considerable speculation why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than our own. [47] By this standard, the Earth is a communicating civilization.  Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a light year away. [48]  Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, L [ edit ]  Michael Shermer estimated L as 420 years, based on the duration of sixty historical Earthly civilizations. [49] Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including reappearance number , this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the reappearance number rather than increase in L , stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.  David Grinspoon has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for L potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed. [50] He proposes that the last factor L be replaced with f IC · T , where f IC is the fraction of communicating civilizations become "immortal" (in the sense that they simply do not die out), and T representing the length of time during which this process has been going on. This has the advantage that T would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.  It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other. [51]  The astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear warfare .  Range of results [ edit ]  As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions, [52] and the values used in portions of the Drake equation are not well-established. [34] [53] [54] [55] In particular, the result can be N ≪ 1 , meaning we are likely alone in the galaxy, or N ≫ 1 , implying there are many civilizations we might contact. One of the few points of wide agreement is that the presence of humanity implies a probability of intelligence arising of greater than zero. [56]  As an example of a low estimate, combining NASA's star formation rates, the rare Earth hypothesis value of f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [57] Mayr's view on intelligence arising, Drake's view of communication, and Shermer's estimate of lifetime:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [40]  f i = 10 −9 , [43]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 304 years [49]   gives:   N = 1.5 × 10 −5 × 10 −9 × 0.2 × 304 = 9.1 × 10 −11   i.e., suggesting that we are probably alone in this galaxy, and possibly in the observable universe.  On the other hand, with larger values for each of the parameters above, values of N can be derived that are greater than 1. The following higher values that have been proposed for each of the parameters:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p = 1 , [29]  n e = 0.2 , [58] [59]  f l = 0.13 , [60]  f i = 1 , [45]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 10 9 years [50]   Use of these parameters gives:   N = 3 × 1 × 0.2 × 0.13 × 1 × 0.2 × 10 9 = 15,600,000   Monte Carlo simulations of estimates of the Drake equation factors based on a stellar and planetary model of the Milky Way have resulted in the number of civilizations varying by a factor of 100. [61]  Has intelligent life ever existed? [ edit ]  The Drake equation can be modified to determine just how unlikely intelligent life must be, to give the result that Earth has the only intelligent life that has ever arisen, either in our galaxy or the universe as a whole. This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ever develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than 6976250000000000000♠ 2.5 × 10 −24 . Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than 6989170000000000000♠ 1.7 × 10 −11 (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66]  Criticism [ edit ]  Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture. Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics. No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known. The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful. [67]  One reply to such criticisms [68] is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference. [69]  Fermi paradox [ edit ]  Main article: Fermi paradox  The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact. [6] A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years might be able to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology . Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been recognized as such, either in our galaxy or in the observable universe of 2 trillion galaxies. [70] [71] According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?". [72] [73]  A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations. [74] In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:   Few intelligent civilizations ever arise. This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, R ∗ · f p · n e · f l · f i , has a low value. The most common suspect is f i , but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that n e is the small term.  Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning f c is small. Typical arguments include that civilizations are too far apart , it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy , civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time , it is dangerous to communicate , and many others.  The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of L is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself , it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others , they tend to experience a technological singularity , and others.   These lines of reasoning lead to the Great Filter hypothesis, [75] which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.  In fiction and popular culture [ edit ]  The equation was cited by Gene Roddenberry as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on Star Trek , the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal. [76] The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:         F   f   2    (  M  g  E  )  −   C   1    R   i   1    ⋅  M  =  L   /   S  o    {\displaystyle Ff^{2}(MgE)-C^{1}Ri^{1}\cdot M=L/So}       However, a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.

(Photo: NASA and European Space Agency)    Adam Frank. (University photo / Brandon Vick)  How can we calculate the likelihood of technological civilizations having existed on other planets? That’s a question Adam Frank, a professor of astronomy, considers in an essay, “Yes, There Have Been Aliens,” published in the New York Times . The author of three books and a national commentator on matters of astronomy and science, Frank outlines research that he and colleague Woodruff Sullivan published in the journal Astrobiology indicating that the overwhelming probability is that many other civilizations have existed during the 13-plus billion years of the universe’s existence.  Franks explains that scientists discuss the probability of life on other planets in term of the Drake equation, developed in the early 1960s by astronomer Frank Drake. The odds of extraterrestrial life, according to Drake, are based on several factors, including how many stars are born each year and how many of those stars have planets orbiting them.   Are we alone in the universe? Setting some limits to our uniqueness (April 26, 2016)   Frank thinks NASA’s Kepler mission has given scientists the confidence to address a key factor in Drake’s equation.  Last month astronomers from the Kepler spacecraft team announced the discovery of 1,284 new planets, all orbiting stars outside our solar system. The total number of such “exoplanets” confirmed via Kepler and other methods now stands at more than 3,000.  As Frank points out, Drake’s equation is not a case of universal law, but, instead, “a mechanism for fostering organized discussion.”  That’s why discussions of extraterrestrial civilizations, no matter how learned, have historically boiled down to mere expressions of hope or pessimism.  With the knowledge provided by Kepler, Frank argues that the odds are high that there have been technological civilizations in the universe before ours.  Specifically, unless the probability for evolving a civilization on a habitable-zone planet is less than one in 10 billion trillion , then we are not the first.  But Frank expects there to be a long wait before anyone can conclude whether any other civilizations currently exist.

Credit: Albert Ziganshin / Shutterstock.com     Many other planets throughout the universe probably hosted intelligent life long before Earth did, a new study suggests.  The probability of a civilization developing on a potentially habitable alien planet would have to be less than one in 10 billion trillion — or one part in 10 to the 22nd power — for humanity to be the first technologically advanced species the cosmos has ever known, according to the study.  "To me, this implies that other intelligent, technology-producing species very likely have evolved before us," said lead author Adam Frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York. [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Alien Life ]      Do you believe alien life exists elsewhere in the universe?       Yes - We may not have found them yet, but they're out there.         No - Aliens are just part of science fiction.         I'm not sure         Get Results  Share This    "Think of it this way: Before our result, you’d be considered a pessimist if you imagined the probability of evolving a civilization on a habitable planet was, say, one in a trillion," Frank said in a statement . "But even that guess — one chance in a trillion — implies that what has happened here on Earth with humanity has in fact happened about 10 billion other times over cosmic history."  In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake devised a formula to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that may exist today in the Milky Way.  Adam Frank and co-author Woodruff Sullivan of the University of Washington were interested in the odds that intelligent aliens have ever existed anywhere in the universe. So they tweaked the famous Drake equation , coming up with an "archaeological version" that doesn't take into account how long alien civilizations may last.  Frank and Sullivan also incorporated observations from NASA's Kepler space telescope and other instruments, which suggest that about 20 percent of all stars host planets in the life-friendly, "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.     The researchers then calculated the probability that Earth was the universe's first-ever abode for intelligent life, after taking into account the number of stars in the observable universe (about 20 billion trillion, according to a recent estimate).  "From a fundamental perspective, the question is, 'Has it ever happened anywhere before?'" Frank said. "Our result is the first time anyone has been able to set any empirical answer for that question, and it is astonishingly likely that we are not the only time and place that an advanced civilization has evolved."  But this doesn't mean that there are lots of intelligent aliens out there, just waiting to be contacted, the researchers stressed.  "The universe is more than 13 billion years old," Sullivan said in the same statement. "That means that even if there have been 1,000 civilizations in our own galaxy, if they live only as long as we have been around — roughly 10,000 years — then all of them are likely already extinct. And others won’t evolve until we are long gone. For us to have much chance of success in finding another 'contemporary' active technological civilization, on average they must last much longer than our present lifetime."  (The 10,000-year figure cited by Sullivan refers to humanity's development of agriculture and other "rudimentary" technologies; mankind has been capable of sending radio waves and other electromagnetic signals out into the cosmos for just a century or so.)

Planets Kepler-36b and Kepler-36c are depicted in this artist's illustration.  Credit: David Aguilar, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics     When life originates on a planet, whether Earth or a distant world, the newborn life-forms may have to overcome incredible odds to come into existence — and a new equation lays out exactly how overwhelming those odds may be.  The creators of the equation hope it can connect diverse areas of research that aim to answer long-standing questions about the origins of life, much like how the famous Drake equation pulled together research concerning communications from intelligent life.  "The idea of the equation, at some level, is to try to connect the unknown, presumably microscopic events that … give rise to the first thing that we would call a living system — to connect those microscopic components to the macroscopic fact of whether a planet has life starting on it," Caleb Scharf, an astrophysicist at Columbia University and lead author of the new work, told Space.com. [ 8 Newfound Alien Worlds Could Potentially Support Life ]  The Drake equation, originally penned by astronomer Frank Drake in the 1960s, laid out a series of terms estimating how many intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations likely exist in the Milky Way. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation in the galaxy, the fraction of planets where life emerges, and the fraction of that life that gains intelligence and the capability to broadcast its presence into space. Over the years, the equation has acted as a road map for researchers searching for communications signals created by intelligent civilizations beyond Earth. Scharf and his co-author Lee Cronin, a chemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, hope to provide a similar road map to researchers trying to work out how — and how often — life forms on a given planet.  "It came out of a moment in the field where we were trying to bring some cohesion to this study of origins of life," which is notorious for its disparate areas of focus, Scharf said. "To my mind, what this equation is trying to do, or at least trying to prompt people to think about, is how you make that connection — how do you go from some story about how life may have originated on Earth to a quantitative assessment of the probability that that happened, and what that means for life elsewhere in the universe," he said.  Series of steps  The new equation breaks down the process of abiogenesis — the formation of life from nonliving components — into a series of simpler factors. Those factors incorporate the planet's conditions, the ingredients needed to form life and the likelihood of those ingredients getting into the right configuration for life to emerge. As with the Drake equation, each of the terms is straightforward to describe, but each hides additional complexity and room for new research.  Here is the equation:       The average number of origin-of-life events for a given planet = (number of building blocks on planet) × 1/(average [mean] number of building blocks needed per "organism") × (availability of building blocks during time t) × (probability of assembly in a given time) × time.  Credit: Caleb Scharf and Lee Cronin    On the left, the equation considers the average (mean) expected number of origin-of-life events for a given planet. To get there, it takes into account the number of potential "building blocks" for life on the planet, the average number of building blocks needed to create a living system, the availability of those building blocks during a given time and the probability of that assembly happening during that time.  On Earth, building blocks for life take the form of amino acids, lipids and certain essential metals. Somewhere else, though, an entirely different set of ingredients could create enough complexity to form life — the equation doesn't assume any specific set is necessary.  "We're being kind of sneaky," Scharf said. "I think it's one of the beautiful things about it: If you write the equation this way, you don't necessarily have to worry about all the fine, fine details, but what you do do is, you start to break open the factors that you might be able to put some numbers to."  For instance, if you know the size of a planet and its composition, you can begin to estimate how many potential building blocks for life there are on the planet. To calculate whether those building blocks are actually available to form life, you'd have to know more about the conditions on the planet, such as its temperature, which could render some of the blocks unusable or inaccessible.  For example, these blocks could be unusable or inaccessible if they're always in gaseous form or if water is not readily available — although future research might show that life could emerge in more scenarios than scientists currently know about.  In that way, the equation "links where people in exoplanetary science may actually begin to get some data, on the size of planets, the composition, and so on, to the piece that we still don't really understand but we know must have some kind of probability of happening": how it is that life first begins, Scharf said.  A trillion test tubes  The value P a , which is the probability that life will assemble out of those particular building blocks over a given time, is murkier — and much more interesting. If the value of P a is very low, it's extremely unlikely that life will form even when the ingredients are there — potentially explaining why humans haven't yet happened to create life in the lab , even if scientists have used the right ingredients, Scharf said. But a planet-wide "lab" would increase the odds that life-creating events will occur.  "We might have to wait 100 million years for it to fall into place just in a test tube," Scharf said. "Whereas on a planet scale, you've got a trillion test tubes — probably even more than that. It's conceivable that, using this equation, playing these games, is hinting at a possible explanation for why we haven't seen life miraculously appearing in our laboratories, that … there's some subtle thing that has to happen that really doesn't happen often."  And if the scale is larger than planetary, Scharf said, that could further increase the likelihood of life forming. Early Earth and Mars, for example, were cultivating their own, separate chemistries, but the early solar system was chaotic ; impacts with other solar system bodies could have resulted in material exchanges between the two planets. That would have led to even more "test tubes" — the chemical mixing could have allowed even more interactions to occur, potentially hitting the right combination, Scharf said.  If multiple planets exchange materials, it could lead to a sort of "chemical amplification [that] could, in principle, be hugely important," he said. "It could be all the difference between getting life to occur or not, especially when we're dealing with such tiny, tiny probabilities on the microscopic scale of something going right," he added.  Factoring our ignorance  Scharf hopes that the new equation can bring together the different areas of research that relate to each of the equation's terms. For instance, the equation provides an opportunity to combine detailed examinations of far-off exoplanets, chemical research about how different molecules in different physical states can interact to generate complexity, and investigations of the smallest possible units that can exhibit living traits. Combining these areas of research, in turn, could help to link scientists' large-scale understanding of exoplanets to the microscopic chemical interactions, Scharf said.  "It's not an answer; it's a new tool for trying to think about the issues involved," Ed Turner, an astronomer at Princeton University, told Space.com. Turner was not involved in the work, but the paper's definition of the left-hand probability — the expected number of origin-of-life events — draws heavily from his work to allow for incorporating scientists' uncertainty about the origins of life based on observations of life on Earth (and how much weight to give those observations ).  "To really put numbers on those, to think very specifically about a lot of the factors in their equation, will require a lot more knowledge about exoplanets than we have now," Turner said. "We may be decades off from being able to talk about things like the total mass of building blocks on a planet's surface and things like that."  Turner pointed out that the same was true about the Drake equation: Scientists have been able to quantify only some of the terms recently, such as the number of potentially habitable planets. Therefore, the equation could become more useful as the science progresses, he said. In the meantime, it can act to "divide our ignorance into different factors" and focus research on those different components, Turner added. [ The Father of SETI: Q&A with Astronomer Frank Drake ]  But some of the factors — especially biological ones, such as the switch from nonliving to living organisms — may not be understood anytime soon, he said.  Paul Davies, an astrobiologist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study, also said that the term that incorporates the probability of nonlife becoming life will be among the hardest to define.  "We don't know the mechanism whereby nonlife turns into life, so we have no way of estimating the odds … It may be one in a trillion trillion (it's easy to imagine that), in which case, Earth life may be unique in the observable universe," Davies told Space.com in an email. "But P a may be quite large. We simply can't say."  "Setting that aside, I think the remaining terms are discussed in a very useful way as a conceptual framework for research," he added.  To get a grip on that probability, humanity would have to encounter another instance of life's emergence beyond our own for comparison. Future observatories that can see exoplanets in more detail, like the James Webb Space Telescope , may be able to detect signatures from life in earlier forms than Drake might have thought we'd spot — life on the microscopic scale rather than life actively communicating with humanity. That kind of data could help illustrate what other forms life can take.  The work also mentions the possibility of life arising multiple times using different building blocks — for instance, that some form of life that previously existed on Earth, or one that exists currently but is unknown to science, came into being separately from our brand of life with a totally different chemical vocabulary. Davies said that a good step toward narrowing down the likelihood would be to investigate Earth's own organisms for evidence of this possibility.  "We just need one other sample of life (second genesis) and the field is transformed, because we would know P a can't be exceedingly small," Davies said. "And that sample might be right here on Earth. Frankly, almost nobody has looked."  The new work was detailed July 4 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Where are they? (ESO/José Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org))    By Dirk Schulze-Makuch    airspacemag.com   May 3, 2016         For decades the famous Drake Equation has been used to estimate the number of technologically advanced species in the universe. Now Adam Frank from the University of Rochester and Woody Sullivan from the University of Washington take a slightly different approach to the problem and suggest a modification of the Drake Equation . Instead of estimating how many civilizations are out there to communicate with today, they estimate how many civilizations have been out there since the beginning of the Universe.     At first glance this seems to be only a slight semantic difference, but it is not. A big unknown in the original Drake Equation is the average lifetime of a civilization during which they might be available to communicate with us. This window might be very short, especially if technological species are typically replaced by machines . Or it could be very long.   Reframing the question makes longevity a moot point. Frank and Sullivan ask: What is the chance that we are the only technological species and always have been ? If we put the question this way, the Drake Equation boils down to A = N ast * f bt , where A is the number of technological species that have ever formed over the history of the observable universe, N ast are all the astronomical unknowns (which we now have a much better handle on than we did in 1961), and f bt are the biological unknowns, which are still many—including the fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears, the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life emerges, and the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.   Based on recent exoplanet discoveries , Frank and Sullivan assume that one-fifth of all stars have habitable planets in orbit around them. This leads them to conclude that there should be other advanced technological civilization out there, unless the chance for developing such a civilization on a habitable planet in the observable universe is less than 1 in 10 24 (a 1 with 24 zeros!). For our own Milky Way galaxy, the odds of being the only technologically advanced civilization are 1 in 60 billion. Thus, it’s very likely that other intelligent, technologically advanced species evolved before us. Even if only one in every million stars hosts a technologically advanced species today, that would still yield a total of about 300,000 such civilizations in the whole galaxy.   The Archilles’ heel of these statistical estimates is of course the biological uncertainties; Earth is still the only planet where we know life exists. The appearance of life may be extremely unlikely, and so might the evolution of technology. After all, there are many intelligent species on our planet, including dolphins, octopi, apes, parrots, and elephants, but only once in 4.6 billion years has a technologically advanced species evolved. And life cannot have appeared in the very early Universe until heavier elements produced by the explosions of many supernovas became abundant.   Still, Frank and Sullivan think their 1 in 10 24 estimate constitutes a “pessimism line”—a lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species has evolved over time. And that’s good news for SETI, even if it doesn’t help us know where to look.     Like this article?

It is just the right distance away from our Sun to allow just the right amount of air, water and heat to support life.    Earth is not the only planet known to have conditions favorable to life. Exoplanets , planets outside our Solar System, have been found in the Goldilocks Zones of other stars in our galaxy. A lot of research is under way to find other Earth-like planets so who knows? We might discover life on other planets within our lifetimes.

[1] [2] The number of such civilizations N , is assumed to be equal to the mathematical product of    R ∗ , the average rate of star formations, in our galaxy,  f p , the fraction of formed stars that have planets,  n e for stars that have planets, the average number of planets that can potentially support life,  f l , the fraction of those planets that actually develop life,  f i , the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, has developed,  f c , the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and  L , the length of time over which such civilizations release detectable signals,    for a combined expression of:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     The equation was written in 1961 by Frank Drake , not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). [3] [4] The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. [3] It is more properly thought of as a Fermi problem rather than as a serious attempt to nail down a precise number.  Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

[5] [6] Cocconi and Morrison argued that radio telescopes had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a wavelength of 21 cm (1,420.4 MHz ). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral hydrogen , the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the radio spectrum .  Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor Harlow Shapley speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution." [7]  Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. Using the 25 m dish of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia , Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti . In this project, which he called Project Ozma , he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21 cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960. [6] The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It was also unsuccessful.  Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a " search for extraterrestrial intelligence " meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting. [8]   As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms. —Frank Drake.   The ten attendees were conference organizer J. Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, Philip Morrison , businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist Melvin Calvin , astronomer Su-Shu Huang , neuroscientist John C. Lilly , inventor Barney Oliver , astronomer Carl Sagan and radio-astronomer Otto Struve . [9] These participants dubbed themselves " The Order of the Dolphin " (because of Lilly's work on dolphin communication ), and commemorated their first meeting with a plaque at the observatory hall. [10] [11]  Equation [ edit ]  The Drake equation is:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     where:   N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone );   and   R ∗ = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy  f p = the fraction of those stars that have planets  n e = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets  f l = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point  f i = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)  f c = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space  L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space [12] [13]   Usefulness [ edit ]     The Allen Telescope Array for SETI    The Drake equation amounts to a summary of the factors affecting the likelihood that we might detect radio-communication from intelligent extraterrestrial life. [1] [12] [14] The last four parameters, f l , f i , f c , and L , are not known and are very difficult to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see criticism ). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation of all the various concepts which scientists must incorporate when considering the question of life elsewhere, [1] [3] and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for scientific analysis . The Drake equation is a statement that stimulates intellectual curiosity about the universe around us, for helping us to understand that life as we know it is the end product of a natural, cosmic evolution, and for helping us realize how much we are a part of that universe. [13] What the equation and the search for life has done is focus science on some of the other questions about life in the universe, specifically abiogenesis , the development of multi-cellular life and the development of intelligence itself. [15]  Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question. [1] It also formed the backbone of astrobiology as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories . Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21 cm hydrogen frequency . No one could say this in 1961. [16]  Modifications [ edit ]  As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters, [17] and many changes and modifications to the equation have been proposed. One line of modification, for example, attempts to account for the uncertainty inherent in many of the terms. [18]  Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations. For example, David Brin states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society". [19] Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.   Colonization  It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other star systems . Each original site expands with an expansion velocity v , and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime L . The result is a more complex set of 3 equations. [19]    Reappearance factor  The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by how many times an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next civilization to evolve . Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if n r is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be 1 + n r , which is the actual reappearance factor added to the equation.    The factor depends on what generally is the cause of civilization extinction . If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a nuclear winter , then n r may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as stellar evolution , then n r may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for f l , that is, how many times life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.    METI factor  Alexander Zaitsev said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation. [20] He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.    The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.    Biogenic gases  Astronomer Sara Seager proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. [21] These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes. [22]    The Seager equation looks like this: [22] [a]       N  =   N   ∗    ⋅   F    Q     ⋅   F    H  Z     ⋅   F    O     ⋅   F    L     ⋅   F    S       {\displaystyle N=N_{*}\cdot F_{\mathrm {Q} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {HZ} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {O} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {L} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {S} }}      where:      N = the number of planets with detectable signs of life  N ∗ = the number of stars observed  F Q = the fraction of stars that are quiet  F HZ = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone  F O = the fraction of those planets that can be observed  F L = the fraction that have life  F S = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas     Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?” [23]  Estimates [ edit ]  Original estimates [ edit ]  There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were: [24] [25]   R ∗ = 1 yr −1 (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)  f p = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)  n e = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)  f l = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)  f i = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)  f c = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)  L = 1000 to 100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)   Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: Range of results ). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that N ≈ L , and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  Current estimates [ edit ]  This section discusses and attempts to list the best current estimates for the parameters of the Drake equation.  Rate of star creation in our galaxy, R ∗ [ edit ]  Latest calculations from NASA and the European Space Agency indicate that the current rate of star formation in our galaxy is about 0.68–1.45 M ☉ of material per year. [26] [27] To get the number of stars per year, this must account for the initial mass function (IMF) for stars, where the average new star mass is about 0.5 M ☉ . [28] This gives a star formation rate of about 1.5–3 stars per year.   Fraction of those stars that have planets, f p [ edit ]  Recent analysis of microlensing surveys has found that f p may approach 1—that is, stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception; and that there are one or more bound planets per Milky Way star. [29] [30]  Average number of planets per star having planets that might support life, n e [ edit ]  In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized  planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy . [31] [32] 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars. [33] Since there are about 100 billion stars in the galaxy, this implies f p · n e is roughly 0.4. The nearest planet in the habitable zone may be as close as 12 light-years away, according to the scientists. [31] [32]  The consensus at the Green Bank meeting was that n e had a minimum value between 3 and 5. Dutch astronomer Govert Schilling has opined that this is optimistic. [34] Even if planets are in the habitable zone , the number of planets with the right proportion of elements is difficult to estimate. [35] Brad Gibson, Yeshe Fenner, and Charley Lineweaver determined that about 10% of star systems in the Milky Way galaxy are hospitable to life, by having heavy elements, being far from supernovae and being stable for a sufficient time. [36]  The discovery of numerous gas giants in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called hot Jupiters may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.  On the other hand, the variety of star systems that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to red dwarf stars might have habitable zones , [37] although the flaring behavior of these stars might argue against this. [38] The possibility of life on moons of gas giants (such as Jupiter 's moon Europa , or Saturn 's moon Titan ) adds further uncertainty to this figure. [39]  The authors of the rare Earth hypothesis propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a hot Jupiter ; and a planet with plate tectonics , a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate axial tilt to generate seasonal variation. [40]  Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, f l [ edit ]  Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that f l may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that abiogenesis may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains anthropic bias , as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical hypothesis testing standpoint, there are zero degrees of freedom , permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on Mars that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for f l close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.  Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for bacteria that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet. [41] It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways. Biochemists Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms." [42] As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of directed panspermia , which states that Earth life began with "microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship".  Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, f i [ edit ]  This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist Ernst Mayr , point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for f i . [43] Likewise, the Rare Earth hypothesis, notwithstanding their low value for n e above, also think a low value for f i dominates the analysis. [44] Those who favor higher values note the generally increasing complexity of life over time, concluding that the appearance of intelligence is almost inevitable, [45] [46] implying an f i approaching 1. Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable. (See Criticism ).  In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the Cambrian explosion , in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the snowball Earth or research into the extinction events have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past life on Mars is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f l but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.  Estimates of f i have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from novae ). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation .  Fraction of the above revealing their existence via signal release into space, f c [ edit ]  For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are some efforts covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for our presence. (See Arecibo message , for example). There is considerable speculation why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than our own. [47] By this standard, the Earth is a communicating civilization.  Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a light year away. [48]  Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, L [ edit ]  Michael Shermer estimated L as 420 years, based on the duration of sixty historical Earthly civilizations. [49] Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including reappearance number , this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the reappearance number rather than increase in L , stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.  David Grinspoon has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for L potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed. [50] He proposes that the last factor L be replaced with f IC · T , where f IC is the fraction of communicating civilizations become "immortal" (in the sense that they simply do not die out), and T representing the length of time during which this process has been going on. This has the advantage that T would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.  It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other. [51]  The astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear warfare .  Range of results [ edit ]  As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions, [52] and the values used in portions of the Drake equation are not well-established. [34] [53] [54] [55] In particular, the result can be N ≪ 1 , meaning we are likely alone in the galaxy, or N ≫ 1 , implying there are many civilizations we might contact. One of the few points of wide agreement is that the presence of humanity implies a probability of intelligence arising of greater than zero. [56]  As an example of a low estimate, combining NASA's star formation rates, the rare Earth hypothesis value of f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [57] Mayr's view on intelligence arising, Drake's view of communication, and Shermer's estimate of lifetime:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [40]  f i = 10 −9 , [43]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 304 years [49]   gives:   N = 1.5 × 10 −5 × 10 −9 × 0.2 × 304 = 9.1 × 10 −11   i.e., suggesting that we are probably alone in this galaxy, and possibly in the observable universe.  On the other hand, with larger values for each of the parameters above, values of N can be derived that are greater than 1. The following higher values that have been proposed for each of the parameters:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p = 1 , [29]  n e = 0.2 , [58] [59]  f l = 0.13 , [60]  f i = 1 , [45]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 10 9 years [50]   Use of these parameters gives:   N = 3 × 1 × 0.2 × 0.13 × 1 × 0.2 × 10 9 = 15,600,000   Monte Carlo simulations of estimates of the Drake equation factors based on a stellar and planetary model of the Milky Way have resulted in the number of civilizations varying by a factor of 100. [61]  Has intelligent life ever existed? [ edit ]  The Drake equation can be modified to determine just how unlikely intelligent life must be, to give the result that Earth has the only intelligent life that has ever arisen, either in our galaxy or the universe as a whole. This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ever develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than 6976250000000000000♠ 2.5 × 10 −24 . Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than 6989170000000000000♠ 1.7 × 10 −11 (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66]  Criticism [ edit ]  Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture. Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics. No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known. The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful. [67]  One reply to such criticisms [68] is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference. [69]  Fermi paradox [ edit ]  Main article: Fermi paradox  The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact. [6] A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years might be able to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology . Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been recognized as such, either in our galaxy or in the observable universe of 2 trillion galaxies. [70] [71] According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?". [72] [73]  A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations. [74] In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:   Few intelligent civilizations ever arise. This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, R ∗ · f p · n e · f l · f i , has a low value. The most common suspect is f i , but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that n e is the small term.  Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning f c is small. Typical arguments include that civilizations are too far apart , it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy , civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time , it is dangerous to communicate , and many others.  The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of L is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself , it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others , they tend to experience a technological singularity , and others.   These lines of reasoning lead to the Great Filter hypothesis, [75] which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.  In fiction and popular culture [ edit ]  The equation was cited by Gene Roddenberry as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on Star Trek , the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal. [76] The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:         F   f   2    (  M  g  E  )  −   C   1    R   i   1    ⋅  M  =  L   /   S  o    {\displaystyle Ff^{2}(MgE)-C^{1}Ri^{1}\cdot M=L/So}       However, a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.

(Intermediate)     (Intermediate)      I was just curious....do the gas giant planets (Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn) have at least a thin band of oxygen in the atmosphere which would make it possible to live in the sky???? (floating cities)  There is only one planet where gaseous oxygen is found: Earth! And the only reason that Earth has oxygen is because Earth has plants that do photosynthesis. There is no other natural process that we know of that will put significant amounts of oxygen into a planet's atmosphere.  So that is bad news if you'd like to live on another planet in our Solar System. However, it does mean that if we ever find a planet around another star that has oxygen in its atmosphere, we can be fairly confident that there is life of some kind on that planet.

By Brian Koberlein in Science Wire | Space  |  February 3, 2016     The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and prompting speculation – and these musings – about advanced aliens.       Our sun is located about two-thirds of the way out from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There are 100 billion suns in our Milky Way. Illustration via Caltech.  Recently the star KIC 8462852 (aka Tabby’s Star) has made news again because of its strange behavior. Possible explanations for its varying brightness (such as comets) don’t seem to fit the observational data, which has some speculating that the star’s behavior could be explained by the presence of an alien civilization. While many astronomers admit that is a possibility, they don’t think aliens are the likely cause. For one, mysterious behavior is not enough to conclude the cause is aliens . For another, the likelihood that an alien civilization actually exists is still a matter of some debate.  The odds of an alien civilization coexisting with humans is often calculated by the Drake equation . It was first proposed by Frank Drake in 1961. Simply take the rate at which stars form in our galaxy and multiply it by the fraction of stars with planets, the average number of planets per star that could support life, the fraction of those that actually develop life, the fraction of life bearing planets that develop civilization, the fraction of civilizations that have detectible signals, and finally the length of time a civilization might last. Crunch the numbers and you have the number of civilizations in our galaxy capable of communicating with us.  When Drake first proposed the equation, the values for each term were largely unknown, but we now have good estimates for many of them. We know that most stars have planets, and the odds of a potentially habitable planet is actually quite high, possibly as high as 100 billion in our galaxy alone.  Unfortunately the really important factors of the Drake equation are still completely unknown. On how many potentially habitable planets does life actually arise? How many of those give rise to civilizations? How long does a typical civilization last? No idea. Depending on the answer to those questions the number of civilizations in our galaxy could range from hundreds of thousands to only one.  The equation was never intended to give an absolute number, though it is often used that way. There are also alternatives such as the Sara Seager’s equation , which focuses on our ability to detect civilizations indirectly rather than requiring active communication. Just because an alien civilization is quiet, that doesn’t mean we can’t see evidence for them. Seager’s approach is to focus on stable red dwarf stars with known potentially habitable worlds. Since red dwarf stars are by far the most common, the odds that we’d find alien life near such a star is higher. She then focuses on planets that transit their home star from our vantage point and are near enough that we have a chance of observing the effects of the planet’s atmosphere on the star’s light. She estimates that there might be two inhabited worlds might be detectable in the next ten years.  Of course this presumes that life forms readily on a habitable planet and survives billions of years, which might not be the case .  The famous Drake equation, formulated by Frank Drake in the 1960s. It brings together key factors to consider when estimating the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy.  What make’s Tabby’s Star particularly interesting is that it hints at being evidence of an artificial structure the size of a solar system, such as a Dyson sphere, which is something only highly advanced civilizations could create. Of course the big underlying assumption here is that the more advanced a civilization is, the more likely it will build such a structure. The idea was first presented by Nikolai Kardashev in 1964 , who proposed a classification of civilizations based upon their energy use. Type I civilizations harness the resources of their home planet, such as humans today. Type II harness almost the full energy of their home star, possibly through technology such as Dyson spheres. Species within the Star Trek universe would typically be Type II. Type III are civilizations that can harness the energy of an entire galaxy, such as the Asgard of the Stargate universe.  Carl Sagan later generalized the Kardashev scale to a logarithmic function of energy use, and estimated that we were at about 0.7.  The Kardashev scale presumes that more advanced civilizations will necessarily demand more energy. Humans have so far lent credence to this idea, since our modern global civilization consumes much more energy than earlier agrarian civilizations. If our human population and demands for technological convenience grows, we will likely expand out into the solar system with a continued rise in energy consumption.  But such a future is not guaranteed. It’s also possible that we will instead reach a stable and sustainable population level, and combined with increasing energy efficiency our energy consumption may flatten. Technological civilizations may stabilize at type I rather than continuing up the scale.  That’s the real challenge with calculating the odds.  Everything we’ve pinned down so far point to a good chance that life forms on planets across the universe … but there’s still too many unknowns.  Even NASA has toyed with the idea of large space habitats. This is a painting of what one might look like on the inside, by space artist Don Davis.  Bottom line: The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and causing speculation about advanced aliens. However, now – as in 1961, when Frank Drake formulated his famous Drake equation – the fact is that there are many unknowns, and we don’t know if our galaxy has numerous advanced civilizations … or one.

Home     Astronomy & Space      Astronomy     May 9, 2016     What are the chances of life on another planet?  May 9, 2016, Tufts University                 In an infinite universe, most scientists agree, the odds of life existing on a planet besides Earth are pretty high. It is unlikely, however, that familiar life forms will be found on any planet within our solar system. Life as we know it—everything from single-celled organisms to human beings—consists largely of liquid water. So a planet that harbors life can't be too cold or water will freeze, nor can it be too hot or all the water will evaporate. Planets closer to the sun than Earth are too hot, and those farther away are too cold. The surface of Venus, for example, is hot enough to melt lead, and would vaporize any living thing, while the surface of Mars is frozen solid.        Life as we know it here on Earth also requires a magnetic field and an atmosphere, both of which protect it from the lethal radiation our parent star, the sun, emits. Earth's magnetic field—generated by its rotating iron core—deflects the solar wind, a continuous stream of high-speed, high-energy particles coming out of the sun. (As those particles careen by the edges of Earth's atmosphere, they sometime create the phenomenon we call the Northern Lights.) Without the magnetic field there, the solar wind might destroy all life on Earth.  As for Earth's atmosphere, it protects life because the water, carbon dioxide and other gases in it absorb solar radiation in its harmful ultraviolet-light form. The parent stars of other solar systems would emit radiation as well, and the planets orbiting them would need the same kind of protection.  Of course, life on Earth also alters the chemical composition of the atmosphere—Earth's atmosphere lacked gaseous oxygen until plants started growing here some million years ago. So molecules like oxygen in the atmosphere of another planet would be one indication—not proof—that there are living things there.  Scientists have been studying the planets of our own solar system for more than 50 years, looking for evidence of past or present life, among other things. Launched in 1967, the Soviet Union's Venera 4 was the first probe known to land on and send back data from another planet. The mission revealed that Venus' famously soupy atmosphere is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide with a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, making it a very unlikely place to harbor life.  Today, NASA's Mars rover, Opportunity, has been sending back reams of data about the red planet since it landed there 12 years ago. Living well past all expectations, Opportunity not only transmits landscape photos and the occasional tweet, but also collects and analyzes soil and atmosphere samples. It's been an invaluable research tool, but has found no direct evidence that life ever existed on Mars, and has revealed that the planet's atmosphere is too thin to protect it from the sun's radiation.  The discovery of thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars has nevertheless greatly increased speculation that there may be some kind of life on a planet outside our solar system. In the past 20 years, we have confirmed the discovery of almost 2,000 planets, called exoplanets, beyond our solar system. Four thousand other exoplanet candidates await confirmation.  The ones most likely to harbor life would be smallish, rocky planets like Earth. Larger planets tend to be composed of hydrogen gas, the most abundant element in the universe, and to not have a solid surface. Good candidates for life would also occupy what scientists call the habitable zone—the zone in which a planet's distance from the parent star makes liquid water possible. The Kepler mission —a space observatory launched by NASA in 1997 to search our galaxy for just these kinds of Earth-like planets—has found one candidate that meets both requirements, Kepler-452b. So the chances of life on another planet are high. However, we have no direct evidence yet of life anywhere other than Earth.  The real question is, will we ever find the planet we're looking for, given that we'll have to survey the planetary systems of the universe's estimated 1 billion trillion stars? And if we do find that planet, will we even recognize the life it harbors? There's no real reason why we should expect to discover life as we know it orbiting a star many light years away from our home solar system . There's so much we don't know that we are severely limited in our ability to even think about the question.

I guess with dark mater and dark energy out of the picture, it leaves us with 4% of the universe. And what percent of that 4% do we know for sure and really understand? Just a totally wild guess here .5% So what does that leave us? 99.5% we don't know yet? It's funny how many intelligent people can deduce from that .5% things like --- There is no other intelligent beings out there. (Should be qualified with "I don't think") There is no God. (You would think if they were really intelligent based on that .5% they would be agnostic.) The list goes on and on with our arrogant beliefs, based on .5%. I am not sure how much more percentage wise we know than a ant. :-)       ogg_ogg     2.3 / 5 (3)  May 09, 2016    Unless life exists within a couple thousand light-years of us, we'll (probably) never know. So, the actual number of potential planets is NOT "billions" or even millions. A "frequency based" probability measure shouldn't be used with only one data point (life here). Bayesian estimates require knowledge we. do. not. have. (yet). It is just speculation that a planet without a magnetic field can't support life. The "life-as-we-know-it" qualification is appropriate, but the assumption that life requires hospitable SURFACE conditions is NOT.  This article is pseudo-scientific rubbish. Other errors I'll mention (it is full of them) is that the Earth's early atmosphere did not "lack" oxygen, but it is believed that there was little present (as O2). We've evidence that life existed 3.6 bya, but it is an assumption that it has existed ever since then, that it only arose here once. Maybe, maybe not. Finally, it is nonsense to discuss an "infinite" Universe. see Boltzmann Brain.       ogg_ogg     1 / 5 (2)  May 09, 2016    since Bayesian probability calculations allow any a priori Probability to be used, I should have written something like "credibly reliable Bayesian estimates require knowledge we. do. not. have.

We have every reason to suspect we can observe life as we know it (say, an oxygenated atmosphere) soon. @rderkis; The beauty of the standard cosmology is that it let us know 100 % of the universe content. More importantly here is that we do know the laws underlying everyday life. There is a brand new paper that shows that we should expect other intelligences out there, because it becomes so unlikely not to have more. (Too many planets.) Also, we do know at least 10 similar planets will happen, because the current number of planets is ~ 7 %  of the total number there will eventually be,        Please sign in to add a comment.

Kenneth R. Lang, a professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, explains The discovery of thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars has greatly increased speculation that there may be some kind of life on a planet outside our solar system. Photo: Ingimage May 6, 2016 Share     Print Email In an infinite universe, most scientists agree, the odds of life existing on a planet besides Earth are pretty high. It is unlikely, however, that familiar life forms will be found on any planet within our solar system. Life as we know it—everything from single-celled organisms to human beings—consists largely of liquid water. So a planet that harbors life can’t be too cold or water will freeze, nor can it be too hot or all the water will evaporate. Planets closer to the sun than Earth are too hot, and those farther away are too cold. The surface of Venus, for example, is hot enough to melt lead, and would vaporize any living thing, while the surface of Mars is frozen solid.  Life as we know it here on Earth also requires a magnetic field and an atmosphere, both of which protect it from the lethal radiation our parent star, the sun, emits. Earth’s magnetic field—generated by its rotating iron core—deflects the solar wind, a continuous stream of high-speed, high-energy particles coming out of the sun. (As those particles careen by the edges of Earth’s atmosphere, they sometime create the phenomenon we call the Northern Lights.) Without the magnetic field there, the solar wind might destroy all life on Earth.  As for Earth’s atmosphere, it protects life because the water, carbon dioxide and other gases in it absorb solar radiation in its harmful ultraviolet-light form. The parent stars of other solar systems would emit radiation as well, and the planets orbiting them would need the same kind of protection.  Of course, life on Earth also alters the chemical composition of the atmosphere—Earth’s atmosphere lacked gaseous oxygen until about a billion years ago, when first algae and then plants began growing here and producing it. So molecules like oxygen in the atmosphere of another planet would be one indication—not proof—that there are living things there.  Scientists have been studying the planets of our own solar system for more than 50 years, looking for evidence of past or present life, among other things. Launched in 1967, the Soviet Union’s Venera 4 was the first probe known to land on and send back data from another planet. The mission revealed that Venus’ famously soupy atmosphere is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide with a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, making it a very unlikely place to harbor life.  Today, NASA’s Mars rover, Opportunity , has been sending back reams of data about the red planet since it landed there 12 years ago. Living well past all expectations, Opportunity not only transmits landscape photos and the occasional tweet , but also collects and analyzes soil and atmosphere samples. It’s been an invaluable research tool, but has found no direct evidence that life ever existed on Mars, and has revealed that the planet’s atmosphere is too thin to protect it from the sun’s radiation.  The discovery of thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars has nevertheless greatly increased speculation that there may be some kind of life on a planet outside our solar system. In the past 20 years, we have confirmed the discovery of almost 2,000 planets, called exoplanets, beyond our solar system. Four thousand other exoplanet candidates await confirmation.  The ones most likely to harbor life would be smallish, rocky planets like Earth. Larger planets tend to be composed of hydrogen gas, the most abundant element in the universe, and to not have a solid surface. Good candidates for life would also occupy what scientists call the habitable zone—the zone in which a planet’s distance from the parent star makes liquid water possible. The Kepler mission —a space observatory launched by NASA in 1997 to search our galaxy for just these kinds of Earth-like planets—has found one candidate that meets both requirements, Kepler-452b. So the chances of life on another planet are high. However, we have no direct evidence yet of life anywhere other than Earth.  The real question is, will we ever find the planet we’re looking for, given that we’ll have to survey the planetary systems of the universe’s estimated 100 octillion (a 1 with 29 zeros after it) stars? And if we do find that planet, will we even recognize the life it harbors? There’s no real reason why we should expect to discover life as we know it orbiting a star many light years away from our home solar system. There’s so much we don’t know that we are severely limited in our ability to even think about the question.

The spiral galaxy NGC 4845, located over 65 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo (The Virgin) is shown in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image released on January 8, 2016.   REUTERS/NASA        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     What are the odds that intelligent life evolved on Earth and nowhere else among the 20 billion trillion stars in the observable universe across 13.8 billion years of cosmic history? About one in 10 billion trillion, according to researchers writing in the journal Astrobiology -- meaning it's very, very unlikely humanity is unique across the sweep of cosmic space and time. Put another way, even if life evolves on only one planet in a billion orbiting in the habitable zone of its star -- the region where water can exist as a liquid and life as it's known on Earth could, in theory, evolve -- "that still means it's happened on the order of 10 trillion times," said Adam Frank, an astronomer at the University of Rochester. Armed with data from NASA's Kepler space telescope showing planets are commonplace, Frank and Woodruff Sullivan, an astronomer at the University of Washington, decided to take a fresh look at the Drake equation , developed in 1961 by astrophysicist Frank Drake as a way of making a rough estimate of how common technological civilizations might be across the Milky Way galaxy. The Drake equation combines three terms from astronomy -- the frequency of star formation, the fraction of those stars that host planets, and the number of planets with environments suitable for life -- with three "biological" terms -- the fraction of such planets with life of any sort, the fraction that might have developed intelligent life, and the number of civilizations capable of making their presence known across interstellar distances. A seventh term indicates how long civilizations might maintain the technology needed to make their presence known. Because the three biological terms are simply unknowns, one can plug in whatever values one wishes depending on whether one is an optimist who believes life is common across the universe or one is more pessimistic. In any case, because the reality of extra-solar planets was not known when the Drake equation was first constructed, not to mention habitable-zone planets, it offered little in the way of concrete answers. The elements of the original Drake equation, constructed in 1961 to serve as a starting point for discussions about the likelihood of intelligent life in the cosmos, is shown compared to a modified version that allows researchers to estimate the odds that Earth is unique in the universe. As it turns out, the odds are unimaginably low. University of Rochester Click on the illustration above to expand. But with data from the Kepler space telescope, Frank and Woodruff decided to come at the Drake equation from a different angle. "All the terms in the Drake equation that have to do with astronomy are now nailed, whereas when I started (out in astronomy 25 years ago) the two (terms) about planets were completely unknown," Frank said in an interview. "So we took that and we changed the question. Instead of asking how many civilizations exist right now for us to communicate with, we asked how many have ever existed?" By asking that question, "we could use this new data (from Kepler) to set a firm limit ... on whether or not we're the only civilization. We can give you the probability, what the probability would have to be per habitable planet, in order for us to be the only time in the universe that a civilization arose." First, they eliminated the time element in the original Drake equation, allowing their analysis to cover the entire history of the cosmos from the Big Bang forward. Then, they combined the three astronomy terms into one known factor and the three biology terms into a single unknown. The revised equation then reads: A = Nf where A is the number of intelligent, technological civilizations, N is the now known astronomical data and f represents the unknown biological elements. By setting A equal to 1 -- humans on Earth -- and plugging in the known values for N, Frank and Sullivan simply solved for the unknown, f. "We took all the probabilities that have to do with life ... we combined them into one term, which we called the biotechnical probability," Frank said. "We have no idea what those values are. Instead of trying to guess them, we solved for them. We took what we knew and solved for the value, how low would it have to be in order for us to be the only time it ever happened?" As it turns out, very, very low. "If I have a bag of planets, and these are planets in the right place to form life, how many of those do I have to sort through before I get to one that has a civilization like ours on it?" Frank asked. "In order for us to be the only time that this has ever happened in the entire history of the universe, we'd have to go through 10 billion trillion before we'd get one like us." A paper explaining the calculations and results, titled "A New Empirical Constraint on the Prevalence of Technological Species in the Universe," is available in the journal Astrobiology .   © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

For other uses, see Drake equation (disambiguation) .     Dr. Frank Drake    The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way  galaxy . [1] [2] The number of such civilizations N , is assumed to be equal to the mathematical product of    R ∗ , the average rate of star formations, in our galaxy,  f p , the fraction of formed stars that have planets,  n e for stars that have planets, the average number of planets that can potentially support life,  f l , the fraction of those planets that actually develop life,  f i , the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, has developed,  f c , the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and  L , the length of time over which such civilizations release detectable signals,    for a combined expression of:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     The equation was written in 1961 by Frank Drake , not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). [3] [4] The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. [3] It is more properly thought of as a Fermi problem rather than as a serious attempt to nail down a precise number.  Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

[5] [6] Cocconi and Morrison argued that radio telescopes had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a wavelength of 21 cm (1,420.4 MHz ). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral hydrogen , the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the radio spectrum .  Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor Harlow Shapley speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution." [7]  Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. Using the 25 m dish of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia , Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti . In this project, which he called Project Ozma , he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21 cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960. [6] The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It was also unsuccessful.  Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a " search for extraterrestrial intelligence " meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting. [8]   As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms. —Frank Drake.   The ten attendees were conference organizer J. Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, Philip Morrison , businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist Melvin Calvin , astronomer Su-Shu Huang , neuroscientist John C. Lilly , inventor Barney Oliver , astronomer Carl Sagan and radio-astronomer Otto Struve . [9] These participants dubbed themselves " The Order of the Dolphin " (because of Lilly's work on dolphin communication ), and commemorated their first meeting with a plaque at the observatory hall. [10] [11]  Equation [ edit ]  The Drake equation is:       N  =   R   ∗    ⋅   f    p     ⋅   n    e     ⋅   f    l     ⋅   f    i     ⋅   f    c     ⋅  L    {\displaystyle N=R_{*}\cdot f_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L}     where:   N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone );   and   R ∗ = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy  f p = the fraction of those stars that have planets  n e = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets  f l = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point  f i = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)  f c = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space  L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space [12] [13]   Usefulness [ edit ]     The Allen Telescope Array for SETI    The Drake equation amounts to a summary of the factors affecting the likelihood that we might detect radio-communication from intelligent extraterrestrial life. [1] [12] [14] The last four parameters, f l , f i , f c , and L , are not known and are very difficult to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see criticism ). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation of all the various concepts which scientists must incorporate when considering the question of life elsewhere, [1] [3] and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for scientific analysis . The Drake equation is a statement that stimulates intellectual curiosity about the universe around us, for helping us to understand that life as we know it is the end product of a natural, cosmic evolution, and for helping us realize how much we are a part of that universe. [13] What the equation and the search for life has done is focus science on some of the other questions about life in the universe, specifically abiogenesis , the development of multi-cellular life and the development of intelligence itself. [15]  Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question. [1] It also formed the backbone of astrobiology as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories . Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21 cm hydrogen frequency . No one could say this in 1961. [16]  Modifications [ edit ]  As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters, [17] and many changes and modifications to the equation have been proposed. One line of modification, for example, attempts to account for the uncertainty inherent in many of the terms. [18]  Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations. For example, David Brin states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society". [19] Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.   Colonization  It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other star systems . Each original site expands with an expansion velocity v , and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime L . The result is a more complex set of 3 equations. [19]    Reappearance factor  The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by how many times an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next civilization to evolve . Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if n r is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be 1 + n r , which is the actual reappearance factor added to the equation.    The factor depends on what generally is the cause of civilization extinction . If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a nuclear winter , then n r may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as stellar evolution , then n r may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for f l , that is, how many times life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.    METI factor  Alexander Zaitsev said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation. [20] He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.    The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.    Biogenic gases  Astronomer Sara Seager proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. [21] These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes. [22]    The Seager equation looks like this: [22] [a]       N  =   N   ∗    ⋅   F    Q     ⋅   F    H  Z     ⋅   F    O     ⋅   F    L     ⋅   F    S       {\displaystyle N=N_{*}\cdot F_{\mathrm {Q} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {HZ} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {O} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {L} }\cdot F_{\mathrm {S} }}      where:      N = the number of planets with detectable signs of life  N ∗ = the number of stars observed  F Q = the fraction of stars that are quiet  F HZ = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone  F O = the fraction of those planets that can be observed  F L = the fraction that have life  F S = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas     Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?” [23]  Estimates [ edit ]  Original estimates [ edit ]  There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were: [24] [25]   R ∗ = 1 yr −1 (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)  f p = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)  n e = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)  f l = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)  f i = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)  f c = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)  L = 1000 to 100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)   Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: Range of results ). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that N ≈ L , and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  Current estimates [ edit ]  This section discusses and attempts to list the best current estimates for the parameters of the Drake equation.  Rate of star creation in our galaxy, R ∗ [ edit ]  Latest calculations from NASA and the European Space Agency indicate that the current rate of star formation in our galaxy is about 0.68–1.45 M ☉ of material per year. [26] [27] To get the number of stars per year, this must account for the initial mass function (IMF) for stars, where the average new star mass is about 0.5 M ☉ . [28] This gives a star formation rate of about 1.5–3 stars per year.   Fraction of those stars that have planets, f p [ edit ]  Recent analysis of microlensing surveys has found that f p may approach 1—that is, stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception; and that there are one or more bound planets per Milky Way star. [29] [30]  Average number of planets per star having planets that might support life, n e [ edit ]  In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized  planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy . [31] [32] 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars. [33] Since there are about 100 billion stars in the galaxy, this implies f p · n e is roughly 0.4. The nearest planet in the habitable zone may be as close as 12 light-years away, according to the scientists. [31] [32]  The consensus at the Green Bank meeting was that n e had a minimum value between 3 and 5. Dutch astronomer Govert Schilling has opined that this is optimistic. [34] Even if planets are in the habitable zone , the number of planets with the right proportion of elements is difficult to estimate. [35] Brad Gibson, Yeshe Fenner, and Charley Lineweaver determined that about 10% of star systems in the Milky Way galaxy are hospitable to life, by having heavy elements, being far from supernovae and being stable for a sufficient time. [36]  The discovery of numerous gas giants in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called hot Jupiters may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.  On the other hand, the variety of star systems that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to red dwarf stars might have habitable zones , [37] although the flaring behavior of these stars might argue against this. [38] The possibility of life on moons of gas giants (such as Jupiter 's moon Europa , or Saturn 's moon Titan ) adds further uncertainty to this figure. [39]  The authors of the rare Earth hypothesis propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a hot Jupiter ; and a planet with plate tectonics , a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate axial tilt to generate seasonal variation. [40]  Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, f l [ edit ]  Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that f l may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that abiogenesis may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains anthropic bias , as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical hypothesis testing standpoint, there are zero degrees of freedom , permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on Mars that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for f l close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.  Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for bacteria that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet. [41] It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways. Biochemists Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms." [42] As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of directed panspermia , which states that Earth life began with "microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship".  Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, f i [ edit ]  This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist Ernst Mayr , point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for f i . [43] Likewise, the Rare Earth hypothesis, notwithstanding their low value for n e above, also think a low value for f i dominates the analysis. [44] Those who favor higher values note the generally increasing complexity of life over time, concluding that the appearance of intelligence is almost inevitable, [45] [46] implying an f i approaching 1. Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable. (See Criticism ).  In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the Cambrian explosion , in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the snowball Earth or research into the extinction events have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past life on Mars is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f l but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.  Estimates of f i have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from novae ). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation .  Fraction of the above revealing their existence via signal release into space, f c [ edit ]  For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are some efforts covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for our presence. (See Arecibo message , for example). There is considerable speculation why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than our own. [47] By this standard, the Earth is a communicating civilization.  Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a light year away. [48]  Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, L [ edit ]  Michael Shermer estimated L as 420 years, based on the duration of sixty historical Earthly civilizations. [49] Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including reappearance number , this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the reappearance number rather than increase in L , stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.  David Grinspoon has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for L potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed. [50] He proposes that the last factor L be replaced with f IC · T , where f IC is the fraction of communicating civilizations become "immortal" (in the sense that they simply do not die out), and T representing the length of time during which this process has been going on. This has the advantage that T would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.  It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other. [51]  The astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear warfare .  Range of results [ edit ]  As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions, [52] and the values used in portions of the Drake equation are not well-established. [34] [53] [54] [55] In particular, the result can be N ≪ 1 , meaning we are likely alone in the galaxy, or N ≫ 1 , implying there are many civilizations we might contact. One of the few points of wide agreement is that the presence of humanity implies a probability of intelligence arising of greater than zero. [56]  As an example of a low estimate, combining NASA's star formation rates, the rare Earth hypothesis value of f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [57] Mayr's view on intelligence arising, Drake's view of communication, and Shermer's estimate of lifetime:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p · n e · f l = 10 −5 , [40]  f i = 10 −9 , [43]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 304 years [49]   gives:   N = 1.5 × 10 −5 × 10 −9 × 0.2 × 304 = 9.1 × 10 −11   i.e., suggesting that we are probably alone in this galaxy, and possibly in the observable universe.  On the other hand, with larger values for each of the parameters above, values of N can be derived that are greater than 1. The following higher values that have been proposed for each of the parameters:   R ∗ = 1.5–3 yr −1 , [26]  f p = 1 , [29]  n e = 0.2 , [58] [59]  f l = 0.13 , [60]  f i = 1 , [45]  f c = 0.2 [Drake, above] , and L = 10 9 years [50]   Use of these parameters gives:   N = 3 × 1 × 0.2 × 0.13 × 1 × 0.2 × 10 9 = 15,600,000   Monte Carlo simulations of estimates of the Drake equation factors based on a stellar and planetary model of the Milky Way have resulted in the number of civilizations varying by a factor of 100. [61]  Has intelligent life ever existed? [ edit ]  The Drake equation can be modified to determine just how unlikely intelligent life must be, to give the result that Earth has the only intelligent life that has ever arisen, either in our galaxy or the universe as a whole. This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ever develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than 6976250000000000000♠ 2.5 × 10 −24 . Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than 6989170000000000000♠ 1.7 × 10 −11 (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66]  Criticism [ edit ]  Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture. Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics. No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known. The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful. [67]  One reply to such criticisms [68] is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference. [69]  Fermi paradox [ edit ]  Main article: Fermi paradox  The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact. [6] A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years might be able to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology . Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been recognized as such, either in our galaxy or in the observable universe of 2 trillion galaxies. [70] [71] According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?". [72] [73]  A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations. [74] In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:   Few intelligent civilizations ever arise. This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, R ∗ · f p · n e · f l · f i , has a low value. The most common suspect is f i , but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that n e is the small term.  Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning f c is small. Typical arguments include that civilizations are too far apart , it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy , civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time , it is dangerous to communicate , and many others.  The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of L is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself , it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others , they tend to experience a technological singularity , and others.   These lines of reasoning lead to the Great Filter hypothesis, [75] which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.  In fiction and popular culture [ edit ]  The equation was cited by Gene Roddenberry as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on Star Trek , the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal. [76] The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:         F   f   2    (  M  g  E  )  −   C   1    R   i   1    ⋅  M  =  L   /   S  o    {\displaystyle Ff^{2}(MgE)-C^{1}Ri^{1}\cdot M=L/So}       However, a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.

That’s a question Adam Frank, a professor of astronomy, considers in an essay, “Yes, There Have Been Aliens,” published in the New York Times . The author of three books and a national commentator on matters of astronomy and science, Frank outlines research that he and colleague Woodruff Sullivan published in the journal Astrobiology indicating that the overwhelming probability is that many other civilizations have existed during the 13-plus billion years of the universe’s existence.  Franks explains that scientists discuss the probability of life on other planets in term of the Drake equation, developed in the early 1960s by astronomer Frank Drake. The odds of extraterrestrial life, according to Drake, are based on several factors, including how many stars are born each year and how many of those stars have planets orbiting them.   Are we alone in the universe? Setting some limits to our uniqueness (April 26, 2016)   Frank thinks NASA’s Kepler mission has given scientists the confidence to address a key factor in Drake’s equation.  Last month astronomers from the Kepler spacecraft team announced the discovery of 1,284 new planets, all orbiting stars outside our solar system. The total number of such “exoplanets” confirmed via Kepler and other methods now stands at more than 3,000.  As Frank points out, Drake’s equation is not a case of universal law, but, instead, “a mechanism for fostering organized discussion.”  That’s why discussions of extraterrestrial civilizations, no matter how learned, have historically boiled down to mere expressions of hope or pessimism.  With the knowledge provided by Kepler, Frank argues that the odds are high that there have been technological civilizations in the universe before ours.  Specifically, unless the probability for evolving a civilization on a habitable-zone planet is less than one in 10 billion trillion , then we are not the first.  But Frank expects there to be a long wait before anyone can conclude whether any other civilizations currently exist.
