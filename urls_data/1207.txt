The culprit, shown, was a nymph that wasn’t carrying disease-causing bacteria and had only a bit of blood in its belly, according to the lab that tested it.      Courtesy of Meghan Rosen      I thought it was just a scab. The brown speck clinging to my baby’s cheek had been there for a day or so, resting on a reddish patch of skin. He must have scratched himself, I thought, as I picked lightly at the mark. My husband was the first to figure out the truth. That little round speck wasn’t a scab at all — it was a tick. I had recently read a scary article about ticks (complete with scary title: “ Be Very Afraid of Ticks ”), and I was terrified. We plucked the bug off the baby, stored it in a plastic baggie and popped it into the freezer. But what next? Head to the ER? Get a blood test for Lyme disease? Start him on antibiotics in case he was infected? None of the above, says pediatric infectious disease specialist Sunil Sood, of Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in Hempstead, N.Y. “It’s all overkill,” he says. A lot of parents panic when they spot a tick on their child because they think first of Lyme disease , a bacterial illness that can hit people with headaches, fevers, arthritis and even paralysis of the face. After hearing Sood talk about ticks on The Diane Rehm Show , I talked with him and with infectious disease physician Paul Mead about what parents need to know. 1. Not all ticks carry Lyme disease. A nasty little spiral-shaped bacteria called Borrelia  burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. It hitches a ride in the guts of some, but not all, tick species. After an infected tick sinks its mouth parts into a person’s skin and begins to feed, the bacteria mosey up from the gut to the tick’s salivary glands and into the person.   But a tick has to be attached for a long time before the bacteria make their way into the body — somewhere in the window of 36 to 48 hours . So if you find a tick crawling on your kid, you’re probably fine: There’s a good chance it hasn’t yet latched on and delivered the bacteria. Blacklegged ticks, or deer ticks, are the main carriers of Borrelia bacteria. So if your child has a brown dog tick, a Rocky Mountain wood tick, or a lone star tick (Baby S’s buddy), you don’t have to worry about Lyme disease. But these other types of ticks can carry different kinds of disease-causing bacteria, so it’s good to know which tick you’re dealing with, Sood says. “Parents should always remember to save the tick,” he says. “That’s the most important thing.” To figure out which kind of tick bit you or your loved one, you can look at pictures on the CDC’s website , or send the tick to an insect identification lab. (We snapped an iPhone pic of Baby S’s tick and e-mailed it to the USDA , which identifies ticks for free.) 2. There’s no need to get the tick tested for diseases. Several labs offer tick-testing services. These facilities will grind the tick up and look for DNA from Borrelia or other disease-causing bacteria. Testing sounded logical to me, so I shelled out 50 bucks to a zoology lab * in Massachusetts and sent off Baby S’s tick. I was hugely relieved when the test results came back negative. That meant Baby S was safe, right? Not necessarily . “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money,” Sood says. Blood in the tick’s belly can interfere with the test results, so the tick could test negative even if it’s carrying harmful bacteria. A positive test isn’t all that telling either. A tick that’s positive for Borrelia hasn’t necessarily passed the bacteria on to the bitten child. What’s more, if the lab destroys the tick without identifying it first, doctors won’t know which disease symptoms to look for, Sood says.  “I don’t want to be looking for Lyme disease when it was a lone star tick,” he says. (* See note below for an update on this point.) 3. Lyme disease doesn’t always cause the hallmark bull’s-eye rash. But nearly 90 percent of kids with Lyme disease do develop a rash at the bite site. The rash is a roughly circular red splotch that gradually grows bigger over time. In some kids, more than one splotch shows up. It can take a month to appear, so parents should stay watchful. For kids who don’t get a rash, look for fever and other flulike symptoms in the warm months, from April to November, Sood says. Since we knew that a lone star tick bit Baby S, we watched for symptoms of ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , both potentially fatal diseases. (They can be hard to spot in infants, so if he had become feverish, knowing the type of tick that bit him would have been helpful information for his pediatrician.) 4. Lyme disease is generally easy to treat. The odds of getting Lyme disease from an individual deer tick bite are pretty low: Even in tick-ridden areas, less than 5 percent of bites result in an infection. But those that do are easy to deal with, Sood says. “Lyme disease is completely treatable. All the symptoms literally melt away with antibiotics.” “I’m actually more worried about mosquito bites than tick bites,” he says. Catching the problem early can make treatment easier, says Paul Mead, an infectious disease physician at the Centers for Disease Control in Fort Collins, Colo. But, he says, “the vast majority of patients who have Lyme disease will recover and do just fine.” Still, about 4 to 5 percent of people who get treated have symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle aches and trouble sleeping, that linger for more than six months. The condition, named post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome , or PTLDS, is commonly known as “chronic Lyme disease,” and on the Internet, it’s a notoriously thorny subject. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there,” Mead says. No one really knows what causes the symptoms. People could be having a delayed immune response, or they may have an undiagnosed illness that’s to blame. But scientists do know that lengthy courses of antibiotics don’t seem to help. “People should be skeptical if providers are telling them that they need to be on months and years of antibiotics,” Mead says. Very few ­— if any — people actually die from Lyme disease. One 2012 study found that from 1999 to 2003, only 23 death certificates listed Lyme disease as the underlying cause (and perhaps only one of those people actually had the disease). During the same time period, the CDC recorded more than 96,000 cases of the disease. But not every case gets reported, Mead says. The CDC estimates that the number of Americans diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is actually around 300,000 . 5. There are a few good ways to prevent tick bites. First, if kids play outside, check them daily for ticks, making sure to inspect easy-to-miss nooks and crannies like the armpits, groin and scalp. Bathing with a washcloth is a simple and effective way to sweep ticks from the skin before they’ve latched on. Bug repellents like DEET and permethrin can help keep ticks away. For kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends formulations with 10 to 30 percent DEET (although Canada’s public health department thinks kids should stick to formulations with 10 percent DEET or less). If you do find a tick that’s attached, remove it right away. A pair of thin-tipped tweezers and an empty container will do the trick, Sood says. “It’s nothing fancy,” he says. Grasp the tick at the mouth end, and pull straight up. “Gentle, steady pressure, and it will generally pop right out,” Sood says. I’m much less panicked about ticks now than I was when one was hanging off Baby S’s face. But I do worry that I might not notice one hiding out in some cozy crevice of his skin. And the problem isn’t likely to go away: The number of Lyme cases might go up as the climate changes and ticks have more warm, woodsy places to live. I know our family needs to be especially vigilant: We live in an area that keeps erupting with new cases. Montgomery County, Maryland, ranked 27th out of more than 3,000 U.S. counties in the number of Lyme disease cases tallied up from 2007 to 2011. It’s number one in Maryland. (You can check out the map in this paper to see if you live in a high-risk area, look at this CDC Excel spreadsheet to see how your county fares, or read more about the CDC’s maps here .) Still, I’m trying to ratchet down my fear level from super-freak-out-panic to something in the neighborhood of responsibly concerned. “I don’t think being alarmed is helpful,” Mead says. “People should be aware of the problem, and know what to do protect themselves.” I’m not ready to douse my family’s clothing in bug repellent just yet, but I have vowed to do daily tick checks and wash well after playing outdoors. And next time, if I see a funny-looking scab on my kids’ skin, I’m checking to see if it has legs. *Update, 4 p.m., August 21, 2015: Microbiologist Stephen Rich of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology (the lab that tested Baby S’s tick) at the University of Massachusetts took issue with Sunil Sood’s statement that “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money.” Rich explained that the lab tests are not intended to diagnose human disease.  Instead, he notes, one of the big benefits is disease surveillance.  In addition to identifying deer ticks, dog ticks, lone star ticks and the diseases they may carry, TickReport makes data available to the public. He makes a good point.  Baby S’s tick was one of 272 ticks the lab has tested from Maryland — five of which came from my zip code alone (none of the five tested positive for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease). So people can use the data to glean info about potential risk in their area. Sood’s point was that testing a tick for bacteria is not a good way to find out if a bitten child was infected. But I agree that there’s certainly value to the information collected from testing ticks and tracking tick bites.      View the discussion thread.

KidsHealth / For Parents / How Do I Watch for Lyme Disease After Removing a Tick?     Print I found a tick on my daughter's arm last night. I pulled it off, but I have no idea how long it had been there, as she plays outside every day. What should I do? How do I tell if the tick gave her Lyme disease? – Mara  Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted primarily by deer ticks. In the United States, Lyme disease is most common in the Northeast, Northwest, and parts of the upper Midwest. So where you live (or travel) and what type of tick you find will help determine if your child is at risk of developing Lyme disease.  Not all deer ticks are infected with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. And a tick that is infected has to be attached to a person's skin for at least 24-48 hours before it can transmit that bacteria. Since you don't know how long the tick was attached, watch for signs that your daughter might be developing the illness.  Many kids who have Lyme disease develop a red rash at the site of the tick bite, which sometimes has a characteristic "bull's-eye" appearance. In the week or two after the tick bite, look for an expanding ring of solid redness or a red bump surrounded by clear skin that is ringed by an expanding red rash. The rash may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle and joint aches.  If she has a bull's-eye rash or other symptoms that can happen in Lyme disease, call your doctor right away. Early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease can prevent serious illness and long-term complications. When diagnosed quickly and given a course of antibiotics, kids with Lyme disease almost always have a good outcome.  Parents can help prevent kids from being exposed to ticks by making sure they wear protective clothing and apply insect repellant containing DEET, especially when playing in grassy or wooded areas where ticks live. Check kids for ticks every day.

Transmission             Recommend on Facebook   Tweet   Share Compartir               The Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi , is spread through the bite of infected ticks. The blacklegged tick (or deer tick, Ixodes scapularis ) spreads the disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States. The western blacklegged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ) spreads the disease on the Pacific Coast. Ticks can attach to any part of the human body but are often found in hard-to-see areas such as the groin, armpits, and scalp. In most cases, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. Most humans are infected through the bites of immature ticks called nymphs. Nymphs are tiny (less than 2 mm) and difficult to see; they feed during the spring and summer months. Adult ticks can also transmit Lyme disease bacteria, but they are much larger and are more likely to be discovered and removed before they have had time to transmit the bacteria. Adult Ixodes ticks are most active during the cooler months of the year.   Relative sizes of blacklegged ticks at different life stages       In general, adult ticks are approximately the size of a sesame seed and nymphal ticks are approximately the size of a poppy seed.              Are there other ways to get Lyme disease?      There is no evidence that Lyme disease is transmitted from person-to-person. For example, a person cannot get infected from touching, kissing, or having sex with a person who has Lyme disease. Lyme disease acquired during pregnancy may lead to infection of the placenta and possible stillbirth; however, no negative effects on the fetus have been found when the mother receives appropriate antibiotic treatment. There are no reports of Lyme disease transmission from breast milk. Although no cases of Lyme disease have been linked to blood transfusion, scientists have found that the Lyme disease bacteria can live in blood that is stored for donation. Individuals being treated for Lyme disease with an antibiotic should not donate blood. Individuals who have completed antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease may be considered as potential blood donors. Information on the current criteria for blood donation is available on the Red Cross website . Although dogs and cats can get Lyme disease, there is no evidence that they spread the disease directly to their owners. However, pets can bring infected ticks into your home or yard. Consider protecting your pet, and possibly yourself, through the use of tick control products for animals. You will not get Lyme disease from eating venison or squirrel meat, but in keeping with general food safety principles, always cook meat thoroughly. Note that hunting and dressing deer or squirrels may bring you into close contact with infected ticks. There is no credible evidence that Lyme disease can be transmitted through air, food, water, or from the bites of mosquitoes, flies, fleas, or lice. Ticks not known to transmit Lyme disease include Lone star ticks ( Amblyomma americanum ), the American dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ), the Rocky Mountain wood tick ( Dermacentor andersoni ), and the brown dog tick ( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ).      How ticks find their hosts      Ticks can't fly or jump. Instead, they wait for a host, resting on the tips of grasses and shrubs in a position known as "questing". While questing, ticks hold onto leaves and grass by their lower legs. They hold their upper pair of legs outstretched, waiting to climb onto a passing host. When a host brushes the spot where a tick is waiting, it quickly climbs aboard. It then finds a suitable place to bite its host.      How ticks attach to their hosts      The tick feeding process makes ticks very good at transmitting infection: Depending on the tick species and its stage of life, preparing to feed can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours. When the tick finds a feeding spot, it grasps the skin and cuts into the surface. The tick then inserts its feeding tube. Many species also secrete a cement-like substance that keeps them firmly attached during the meal. The feeding tube can have barbs, which help keep the tick in place. Ticks also can secrete small amounts of saliva with anesthetic properties so that the animal or person can't feel that the tick has attached itself. If the tick is in a sheltered spot, it can go unnoticed. A blacklegged tick will attach to its host and suck the blood slowly for several days. If the host animal has certain bloodborne infections, such as the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, the tick may ingest the pathogen and become infected. If the tick later feeds on a human, that human can become infected. After feeding, the blacklegged tick drops off and prepares for the next life stage. At its next feeding, it can then transmit the infection to the new host. Once infected, a tick can transmit infection throughout its life. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease. It takes some time for the Lyme disease-causing bacteria to move from the tick to the host. The longer the tick is attached, the greater the risk of acquiring disease from it.      Lifecycle of blacklegged ticks      The lifecycle of blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus ) generally lasts two years. During this time, they go through four life stages: egg, six-legged larva, eight-legged nymph, and adult. After the eggs hatch, the ticks must have a blood meal at every stage to survive. Blacklegged ticks can feed from mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The ticks need to have a new host at each stage of their life, as shown below:      This diagram shows the lifecycle of blacklegged ticks that can transmit Lyme disease.

Skerrett Former Executive Editor, Harvard Health        The 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year are just the tip of the iceberg. According to a new CDC estimate , more than 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with the tick-borne disease each year. The new number was presented at the 2013 International Conference on Lyme Borreliosis and Other Tick-Borne Diseases , being held in Boston.  Although the new numbers may be an overestimate, they still provide a clearer picture of the impact of Lyme disease in the United States, says Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, a rheumatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Instead of relying mainly on cases reported by doctors, a standard public health approach, CDC researchers are trying to get a more complete picture of Lyme infections by sifting through health insurance claims, analyzing data from clinical laboratories (which do the tests necessary to diagnose Lyme disease), and surveying the public for self-reported Lyme disease.  “We know that routine surveillance only gives us part of the picture, and that the true number of illnesses is much greater,” said Paul Mead, M.D., chief of epidemiology and surveillance for CDC’s Lyme disease program, in a statement. “This new preliminary estimate confirms that Lyme disease is a tremendous public health problem in the United States, and clearly highlights the urgent need for prevention.”  Although Lyme disease has been diagnosed in almost every state , most cases reported to the CDC are in the Northeast and upper Midwest—96% of cases come from 13 states.  The aftermath of a tick bite  Lyme disease is a zoonotic disease , meaning a disease spread between animals and humans. It is caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which lives in mice and deer. These corkscrew-shaped bacteria, called spirochetes, get into black-legged ticks when they feed on an infected animal. They migrate to the tick’s salivary glands, and, if the tick bites a person, are injected into the bloodstream. An excellent illustration by The Boston Globe depicts this life cycle.  In some people, the immune system destroys the bacteria before they can do any damage. In others, they grow and multiply, causing an infection. Symptoms include a bull’s-eye-shaped rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. Treatment with antibiotics can usually prevent any short- or long-term repercussions, says Dr. Shmerling.  If the infection isn’t treated, problems can develop in other parts of the body, including the joints, heart, and nerves. It can also cause arthritis that persists months or years after the tick bite.  Some people with Lyme disease and some doctors have argued that Borrelia burgdorferi can somehow evade courses of antibiotics and become a chronic infection that needs long-term antibiotic treatment—even though conventional antibody tests are negative. Chronic Lyme disease has been blamed for causing pain, fatigue, muscle aches, loss of memory and thinking skills, and a host of other problems.  A Boston Globe series, “Bitten By Uncertainty,” has been exploring this controversial side of Lyme disease.  Prevention is key  Like most communicable diseases, Lyme disease is largely preventable, says Dr. Shmerling. Avoid being bitten by a blacklegged tick (also known as a deer tick) and you won’t get Lyme disease. There are two main ways to do that—stay out of brush and high grass in and around wooded areas, or get out in nature and protect yourself. Here are six tips for protecting yourself from ticks, adapted from the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station’s comprehensive handbook about tick management .  1. Wear light-colored clothing. Light colors make ticks easier to spot, especially tiny deer tick nymphs.  2. Tuck your pants inside your socks. It may not be a flattering look, but it creates a physical barrier against ticks.  3. Use insect repellent. Most of the chemicals that repel mosquitoes are somewhat effective against ticks, although it may take a heavier concentration of DEET—between 30% and 40%—to really keep them away. Permethrin is a stronger chemical that kills ticks as well as repels them. Products containing permethrin should be sprayed on clothes , not on the skin. Picaridin repels mosquitoes and other insects but not ticks.  4. Stay in the middle of the path (or fairway). Ticks can’t fly or jump, so they can only get on you if you come into contact with the kind of environment they live in: moist, often shady, wooded areas, with leaves, low-lying plants, and shrubs.  5. Think sunny. Ticks don’t do well in dry, open areas. Lawn furniture and playground equipment should be set back from the edge of wooded, shady areas. If you’re picnicking, pick a patch of well-tended lawn or some open ground.  6. Inspect yourself and your children (and your pets), especially the legs and groin. Ticks usually get picked up on the lower legs and then climb upward in search of a meal. The odds of contracting Lyme or other tick-borne disease are minimized if a tick is removed soon after it’s attached, and there’s no risk if it’s still crawling around. The shower is a good place to conduct a tick check. Feel for any new bumps on soaped-up skin.  And if you do get bitten by a tick, remove it using the method recommended by the CDC : Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. Then pull it out with a steady motion. Once the tick has been removed, clean the skin with soap and water. Dispose of the tick, which is probably still alive, by placing it in alcohol or flushing it down the toilet. Don’t fall for “home remedies” like covering the tick with Vaseline or touching it with a just-blown-out match.

Posted September 16th, 2013 at 9:33 am  Michelle    I will never forget when I was a kid, my Dad pulled a tick from the base of my neck, and then set fire to it. It scorched a place of my Mom’s hard wood floor. She never did find out where it came from.  I got the tick from fishing with my Dad on the previous day, so I was ordered to silence. The tick was engorged and I had no idea it was there.         Posted September 4th, 2013 at 10:09 pm  Janet Barry    While my daughter’s father-in-law is being treated for Lyme disease in CT, one of my dogs has been exposed to Lyme disease in Poway (San Diego County) this summer. I have never heard of it here in our area, but apparently it is here to stay. This occurred in my own backyard. A routine test for heartworm from my vet showed this exposure. People on the west coast think they and their animals are immune, but that is not the case. Get tested, and have your animals tested if you find ticks or the “red ring” on your body. I hear it is extremely painful.         Posted August 22nd, 2013 at 10:59 am  Prabodhan    Which insect repellent, will you advise.         Posted August 20th, 2013 at 6:14 pm  Science    It’s sad to see such bad maths. The CDC writes that 300 000 is “10 times higher than” 30 000. But the expression means 11 times. CDC being rather an important body should know better but while it may be excusable for them, I really expect more from a world reknowned institution like Harvard. “Lyme disease 10 times more common than thought” should be “Lyme disease 10 times as common as thought”. I would also add the word “previously” before “thought”.         Posted August 23rd, 2013 at 6:10 pm  Joe    Seriously? Isn’t life too short for this kind of stuff?

Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.  You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying the disease thrive. It's important to take common-sense precautions in areas where ticks are prevalent.      Symptoms    Lyme disease rash Lyme disease rash People with Lyme disease may experience a characteristic bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and may eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across.      The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary and usually appear in stages.  Early signs and symptoms  A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease.  However, these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected:    Rash. From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull’s-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It is typically not itchy or painful.  Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.   Flu-like symptoms. Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches and a headache may accompany the rash.   Later signs and symptoms  If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include:   Erythema migrans appearing in other areas of your body.  Joint pain. Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another.  Neurological problems. Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement.   Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium Borrelia mayonii may also include:   Nausea and vomiting  Diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease)   Less common signs and symptoms  Several weeks after infection, some people develop:   Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat. Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks.  Eye inflammation.  Liver inflammation (hepatitis).  Severe fatigue.   When to see a doctor  If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms  Only a minority of blacklegged tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.  If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease — particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent — contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.  See your doctor even if symptoms disappear  It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear — the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems. Ticks also can transmit other illnesses, such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Deer tick Deer tick The deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) goes through three life stages. Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.      In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii bacteria, carried primarily by blacklegged or deer ticks. The ticks are brown and, when young, often no bigger than a poppy seed, which can make them nearly impossible to spot.  To contract Lyme disease, an infected deer tick must bite you. The bacteria enter your skin through the bite and eventually make their way into your bloodstream. In most cases, to transmit Lyme disease, a deer tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours. If you find an attached tick looks swollen, it may have fed long enough to transmit bacteria. Removing the tick as soon as possible may prevent infection.  Risk factors Where you live or vacation can affect your chances of getting Lyme disease. So can your profession and the outdoor activities you enjoy. The most common risk factors for Lyme disease include:    Spending time in wooded or grassy areas. In the United States, deer ticks are most prevalent in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which have heavily wooded areas where deer ticks thrive. Children who spend a lot of time outdoors in these regions are especially at risk. Adults with outdoor occupations also are at increased risk.  In the first two stages of life, deer ticks in the United States feed on mice and other rodents, which are a prime reservoir for Lyme disease bacteria. Adult deer ticks feed primarily on white-tailed deer.   Having exposed skin. Ticks attach easily to bare flesh. If you're in an area where ticks are common, protect yourself and your children by wearing long sleeves and long pants. Don't allow your pets to wander in tall weeds and grasses.  Not removing ticks promptly or properly. Bacteria from a tick bite can enter your bloodstream if the tick stays attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours or longer. If you remove a tick within two days, your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low.   Complications Left untreated, Lyme disease can cause:   Chronic joint inflammation (Lyme arthritis), particularly of the knee  Neurological symptoms, such as facial palsy and neuropathy  Cognitive defects, such as impaired memory  Heart rhythm irregularities   Prevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:   Cover up. When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.  Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouth. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.  Do your best to tick-proof your yard. Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Keep woodpiles in sunny areas.   Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin, so you may not discover them unless you search carefully.  It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.   Don't assume you're immune. You can get Lyme disease more than once.  Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick, but pull carefully and steadily. Once you've removed the entire tick, dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.

Lyme disease is spread by the bite of an infected tick. In the United States, an estimated 300,000 infections occur each year. If you camp, hike, work, or play in wooded or grassy places, you could be bitten by an infected tick.  People living in or visiting New England, the mid-Atlantic states, and the upper Midwest are at greatest risk. But you and your family can prevent tick bites and reduce your risk of Lyme disease.  Protect Yourself from Tick Bites  Know where to expect ticks. Blacklegged ticks (the ticks that cause Lyme disease) live in moist and humid environments, particularly in and near wooded or grassy areas. You may get a tick on you during outdoor activities around your home or when walking through leaves and bushes. To avoid ticks, walk in the center of trails and avoid walking through tall bushes or other vegetation.     Though Lyme disease cases have been reported in nearly every state, cases are reported from the infected person’s county of residence, not the place where they were infected. More Lyme disease data >    Repel ticks on skin and clothing. Use repellent that contains 20 percent or more DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 on exposed skin for protection that lasts several hours. Always follow product instructions. Parents should apply this product to their children, avoiding hands, eyes, and mouth. Use products that contain permethrin on clothing. Treat clothing and gear, such as boots, pants, socks and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin. It remains protective through several washings. Pre-treated clothing is available and may be protective longer.   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has an online tool to help you select the repellent that is best for you and your family.  For detailed information about preventing ticks on pets and in your yard, see Lyme Disease Prevention and Control .  For detailed information for outdoor workers, see NIOSH Safety and Health Topic: Tick-borne Diseases .   Perform Daily Tick Checks  Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, even in your own yard. Search your entire body for ticks when you return from an area that may have ticks. Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body and remove any tick you find . Take special care to check these parts of your body and your child’s body for ticks:       Under the arms  In and around the ears  Inside the belly button  Back of the knees  In and around all head and body hair  Between the legs  Around the waist    Check your clothing and pets for ticks because they may carry ticks into the house. Check clothes and pets carefully and remove any ticks that are found. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat to kill ticks.  Remove Attached Ticks Quickly and Correctly   Remove an attached tick with fine-tipped tweezers as soon as you notice it. If a tick is attached to your skin for less than 24 hours, your chance of getting Lyme disease is extremely small; however, other diseases may be transmitted more quickly.  Over the next few weeks, watch for signs or symptoms of Lyme disease such as rash or fever. See a healthcare provider if you have signs or symptoms. For more information, see tick removal .  Be Alert for Fever or Rash  Even if you don’t remember being bitten by a tick, an unexpected summer fever or odd rash may be the first signs of Lyme disease, particularly if you’ve been in tick habitat. See your healthcare provider if you have symptoms.  Prevent Ticks on Animals  Prevent family pets from bringing ticks into the home by limiting their access to tick-infested areas and by using veterinarian-prescribed tick collars or spot-on treatment.  Create Tick-safe Zones in Your Yard  Modify your landscaping to create “Tick-Safe Zones.” It’s pretty simple. Keep patios, play areas, and playground equipment away from shrubs, bushes, and other vegetation. Regularly remove leaves, clear tall grasses and brush around your home, and place wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas to keep ticks away from recreational areas (and away from you).   Use a chemical control agent. Effective tick control chemicals are available for homeowners to use, or a professional pest control expert can apply them.  Discourage deer. Deer are the main food source of adult ticks. Keep deer away from your home by removing plants that attract deer and by constructing barriers (like a fence) to discourage deer from entering your yard and bringing ticks with them. ​    More Information  Disease of the Week – Lyme Disease         Features Media   Sign up for Features     Get Email Updates  To receive email updates about this page, enter your email address:    Enter Email Address   Enter Email Address  What's this?

The culprit, shown, was a nymph that wasn’t carrying disease-causing bacteria and had only a bit of blood in its belly, according to the lab that tested it.      Courtesy of Meghan Rosen      I thought it was just a scab. The brown speck clinging to my baby’s cheek had been there for a day or so, resting on a reddish patch of skin. He must have scratched himself, I thought, as I picked lightly at the mark. My husband was the first to figure out the truth. That little round speck wasn’t a scab at all — it was a tick. I had recently read a scary article about ticks (complete with scary title: “ Be Very Afraid of Ticks ”), and I was terrified. We plucked the bug off the baby, stored it in a plastic baggie and popped it into the freezer. But what next? Head to the ER? Get a blood test for Lyme disease? Start him on antibiotics in case he was infected? None of the above, says pediatric infectious disease specialist Sunil Sood, of Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in Hempstead, N.Y. “It’s all overkill,” he says. A lot of parents panic when they spot a tick on their child because they think first of Lyme disease , a bacterial illness that can hit people with headaches, fevers, arthritis and even paralysis of the face. After hearing Sood talk about ticks on The Diane Rehm Show , I talked with him and with infectious disease physician Paul Mead about what parents need to know. 1. Not all ticks carry Lyme disease. A nasty little spiral-shaped bacteria called Borrelia  burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. It hitches a ride in the guts of some, but not all, tick species. After an infected tick sinks its mouth parts into a person’s skin and begins to feed, the bacteria mosey up from the gut to the tick’s salivary glands and into the person.   But a tick has to be attached for a long time before the bacteria make their way into the body — somewhere in the window of 36 to 48 hours . So if you find a tick crawling on your kid, you’re probably fine: There’s a good chance it hasn’t yet latched on and delivered the bacteria. Blacklegged ticks, or deer ticks, are the main carriers of Borrelia bacteria. So if your child has a brown dog tick, a Rocky Mountain wood tick, or a lone star tick (Baby S’s buddy), you don’t have to worry about Lyme disease. But these other types of ticks can carry different kinds of disease-causing bacteria, so it’s good to know which tick you’re dealing with, Sood says. “Parents should always remember to save the tick,” he says. “That’s the most important thing.” To figure out which kind of tick bit you or your loved one, you can look at pictures on the CDC’s website , or send the tick to an insect identification lab. (We snapped an iPhone pic of Baby S’s tick and e-mailed it to the USDA , which identifies ticks for free.) 2. There’s no need to get the tick tested for diseases. Several labs offer tick-testing services. These facilities will grind the tick up and look for DNA from Borrelia or other disease-causing bacteria. Testing sounded logical to me, so I shelled out 50 bucks to a zoology lab * in Massachusetts and sent off Baby S’s tick. I was hugely relieved when the test results came back negative. That meant Baby S was safe, right? Not necessarily . “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money,” Sood says. Blood in the tick’s belly can interfere with the test results, so the tick could test negative even if it’s carrying harmful bacteria. A positive test isn’t all that telling either. A tick that’s positive for Borrelia hasn’t necessarily passed the bacteria on to the bitten child. What’s more, if the lab destroys the tick without identifying it first, doctors won’t know which disease symptoms to look for, Sood says.  “I don’t want to be looking for Lyme disease when it was a lone star tick,” he says. (* See note below for an update on this point.) 3. Lyme disease doesn’t always cause the hallmark bull’s-eye rash. But nearly 90 percent of kids with Lyme disease do develop a rash at the bite site. The rash is a roughly circular red splotch that gradually grows bigger over time. In some kids, more than one splotch shows up. It can take a month to appear, so parents should stay watchful. For kids who don’t get a rash, look for fever and other flulike symptoms in the warm months, from April to November, Sood says. Since we knew that a lone star tick bit Baby S, we watched for symptoms of ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , both potentially fatal diseases. (They can be hard to spot in infants, so if he had become feverish, knowing the type of tick that bit him would have been helpful information for his pediatrician.) 4. Lyme disease is generally easy to treat. The odds of getting Lyme disease from an individual deer tick bite are pretty low: Even in tick-ridden areas, less than 5 percent of bites result in an infection. But those that do are easy to deal with, Sood says. “Lyme disease is completely treatable. All the symptoms literally melt away with antibiotics.” “I’m actually more worried about mosquito bites than tick bites,” he says. Catching the problem early can make treatment easier, says Paul Mead, an infectious disease physician at the Centers for Disease Control in Fort Collins, Colo. But, he says, “the vast majority of patients who have Lyme disease will recover and do just fine.” Still, about 4 to 5 percent of people who get treated have symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle aches and trouble sleeping, that linger for more than six months. The condition, named post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome , or PTLDS, is commonly known as “chronic Lyme disease,” and on the Internet, it’s a notoriously thorny subject. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there,” Mead says. No one really knows what causes the symptoms. People could be having a delayed immune response, or they may have an undiagnosed illness that’s to blame. But scientists do know that lengthy courses of antibiotics don’t seem to help. “People should be skeptical if providers are telling them that they need to be on months and years of antibiotics,” Mead says. Very few ­— if any — people actually die from Lyme disease. One 2012 study found that from 1999 to 2003, only 23 death certificates listed Lyme disease as the underlying cause (and perhaps only one of those people actually had the disease). During the same time period, the CDC recorded more than 96,000 cases of the disease. But not every case gets reported, Mead says. The CDC estimates that the number of Americans diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is actually around 300,000 . 5. There are a few good ways to prevent tick bites. First, if kids play outside, check them daily for ticks, making sure to inspect easy-to-miss nooks and crannies like the armpits, groin and scalp. Bathing with a washcloth is a simple and effective way to sweep ticks from the skin before they’ve latched on. Bug repellents like DEET and permethrin can help keep ticks away. For kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends formulations with 10 to 30 percent DEET (although Canada’s public health department thinks kids should stick to formulations with 10 percent DEET or less). If you do find a tick that’s attached, remove it right away. A pair of thin-tipped tweezers and an empty container will do the trick, Sood says. “It’s nothing fancy,” he says. Grasp the tick at the mouth end, and pull straight up. “Gentle, steady pressure, and it will generally pop right out,” Sood says. I’m much less panicked about ticks now than I was when one was hanging off Baby S’s face. But I do worry that I might not notice one hiding out in some cozy crevice of his skin. And the problem isn’t likely to go away: The number of Lyme cases might go up as the climate changes and ticks have more warm, woodsy places to live. I know our family needs to be especially vigilant: We live in an area that keeps erupting with new cases. Montgomery County, Maryland, ranked 27th out of more than 3,000 U.S. counties in the number of Lyme disease cases tallied up from 2007 to 2011. It’s number one in Maryland. (You can check out the map in this paper to see if you live in a high-risk area, look at this CDC Excel spreadsheet to see how your county fares, or read more about the CDC’s maps here .) Still, I’m trying to ratchet down my fear level from super-freak-out-panic to something in the neighborhood of responsibly concerned. “I don’t think being alarmed is helpful,” Mead says. “People should be aware of the problem, and know what to do protect themselves.” I’m not ready to douse my family’s clothing in bug repellent just yet, but I have vowed to do daily tick checks and wash well after playing outdoors. And next time, if I see a funny-looking scab on my kids’ skin, I’m checking to see if it has legs. *Update, 4 p.m., August 21, 2015: Microbiologist Stephen Rich of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology (the lab that tested Baby S’s tick) at the University of Massachusetts took issue with Sunil Sood’s statement that “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money.” Rich explained that the lab tests are not intended to diagnose human disease.  Instead, he notes, one of the big benefits is disease surveillance.  In addition to identifying deer ticks, dog ticks, lone star ticks and the diseases they may carry, TickReport makes data available to the public. He makes a good point.  Baby S’s tick was one of 272 ticks the lab has tested from Maryland — five of which came from my zip code alone (none of the five tested positive for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease). So people can use the data to glean info about potential risk in their area. Sood’s point was that testing a tick for bacteria is not a good way to find out if a bitten child was infected. But I agree that there’s certainly value to the information collected from testing ticks and tracking tick bites.      View the discussion thread.

KidsHealth / For Teens / What's My Lyme Disease Risk? What's in this article? What Areas Are Most Affected? Outdoor Activities and Pets Can Lyme Disease Be Prevented? How Do I Remove a Tick?     Print en español ¿Cuál es mi riesgo de contraer la enfermedad de Lyme? Is the thought of Lyme disease making you feel you'd be safer in the comfort of your room rather than the great outdoors? Before you download a summer-long supply of games and apps, here's some information to help you know if you're at risk for Lyme disease.  What Areas Are Most Affected?  Lyme disease is the leading tick-borne (carried by ticks) disease in the United States. Experts think that some cases of Lyme disease aren't found because some people don't know that they have it.  Nearly all cases of Lyme disease in the United States happen in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal states. Lyme disease has been reported in other states (and even in Asia, Europe, and Canada), but those hardest hit are:   Connecticut  Delaware  Maine  Massachusetts  Maryland  Minnesota  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island  Wisconsin  Vermont  Virginia   Outdoor Activities and Pets  Besides living in one of these areas, other things that might increase your risk include:   spending a lot of time outdoors in tall grass, brush, shrubs, or wooded areas  having pets that may carry ticks indoors  activities such as yardwork, hiking, camping, fishing, or hunting in tick-infested areas       Can Lyme Disease Be Prevented?  So you got a job as a landscaper this summer and you're planning a big camping trip. Take these precautions to protect yourself:   Wear closed shoes or boots, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants.  Tuck your pants into shoes or boots to prevent ticks from crawling up your legs.  Wear light-colored clothing to help you see ticks easily.  Keep long hair pulled back or wear a hat for added protection.  When outside, don't sit on the ground.  Use an insect repellent containing 10% to 30% DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide).  While outdoors, check yourself for ticks often. Check again after you go back inside (don't forget to check pets too).  Wash all clothes after leaving tick-infested areas, and thoroughly shampoo your hair to eliminate any unseen ticks.   If you use insect repellents containing DEET, follow the instructions on the product's label. Don't put on too much. Using more product than you need won't increase your protection.  Place DEET on shirt collars and sleeves and pants cuffs, and only use it directly on exposed areas of skin. Be sure to wash it off when you go back indoors. Don't spray aerosol or pump products containing DEET directly onto your face; instead, spray it on your hands and rub it into your face. How Do I Remove a Tick?  You should know how to remove a tick just in case one lands on you or a friend.  First, don't panic. Your risk of developing Lyme disease after being bitten by a tick is low. And it takes at least 24–48 hours for the tick to transmit the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. To be safe, remove the tick as soon as possible.  If you find a tick:   Call your doctor, who may want you to save the tick after removal so that the tick can later be identified as the type that may carry Lyme disease. You can put the tick in a sealed container to preserve it.  Use tweezers to grasp the tick firmly at its head or mouth, next to your skin.  Pull firmly and steadily on the tick until it lets go of the skin. If part of the tick stays in your skin, don't worry. It will eventually come out — although you should call your doctor if you notice any irritation in the area or symptoms of Lyme disease.  Swab the bite site with alcohol.   Note: Don't use petroleum jelly or a lit match to kill a tick. They won't get the tick off your skin quickly enough, and may just cause it to burrow deeper into your skin.

Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.  You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying the disease thrive. It's important to take common-sense precautions in areas where ticks are prevalent.      Symptoms    Lyme disease rash Lyme disease rash People with Lyme disease may experience a characteristic bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and may eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across.      The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary and usually appear in stages.  Early signs and symptoms  A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease.  However, these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected:    Rash. From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull’s-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It is typically not itchy or painful.  Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.   Flu-like symptoms. Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches and a headache may accompany the rash.   Later signs and symptoms  If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include:   Erythema migrans appearing in other areas of your body.  Joint pain. Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another.  Neurological problems. Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement.   Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium Borrelia mayonii may also include:   Nausea and vomiting  Diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease)   Less common signs and symptoms  Several weeks after infection, some people develop:   Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat. Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks.  Eye inflammation.  Liver inflammation (hepatitis).  Severe fatigue.   When to see a doctor  If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms  Only a minority of blacklegged tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.  If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease — particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent — contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.  See your doctor even if symptoms disappear  It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear — the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems. Ticks also can transmit other illnesses, such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.      In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii bacteria, carried primarily by blacklegged or deer ticks. The ticks are brown and, when young, often no bigger than a poppy seed, which can make them nearly impossible to spot.  To contract Lyme disease, an infected deer tick must bite you. The bacteria enter your skin through the bite and eventually make their way into your bloodstream. In most cases, to transmit Lyme disease, a deer tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours. If you find an attached tick looks swollen, it may have fed long enough to transmit bacteria. Removing the tick as soon as possible may prevent infection.  Risk factors Where you live or vacation can affect your chances of getting Lyme disease. So can your profession and the outdoor activities you enjoy. The most common risk factors for Lyme disease include:    Spending time in wooded or grassy areas. In the United States, deer ticks are most prevalent in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which have heavily wooded areas where deer ticks thrive. Children who spend a lot of time outdoors in these regions are especially at risk. Adults with outdoor occupations also are at increased risk.  In the first two stages of life, deer ticks in the United States feed on mice and other rodents, which are a prime reservoir for Lyme disease bacteria. Adult deer ticks feed primarily on white-tailed deer.   Having exposed skin. Ticks attach easily to bare flesh. If you're in an area where ticks are common, protect yourself and your children by wearing long sleeves and long pants. Don't allow your pets to wander in tall weeds and grasses.  Not removing ticks promptly or properly. Bacteria from a tick bite can enter your bloodstream if the tick stays attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours or longer. If you remove a tick within two days, your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low.   Complications Left untreated, Lyme disease can cause:   Chronic joint inflammation (Lyme arthritis), particularly of the knee  Neurological symptoms, such as facial palsy and neuropathy  Cognitive defects, such as impaired memory  Heart rhythm irregularities   Prevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:   Cover up. When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.  Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouth. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.  Do your best to tick-proof your yard. Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Keep woodpiles in sunny areas.   Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin, so you may not discover them unless you search carefully.  It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.   Don't assume you're immune. You can get Lyme disease more than once.  Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick, but pull carefully and steadily. Once you've removed the entire tick, dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.

In addition,  821 probable cases (physician-diagnosed cases that did not meet clinical  evidence criteria for a confirmed case but that had laboratory evidence of  infection) were reported. Despite some yearly fluctuations, the number of  reported cases of Lyme disease has been increasing, as evidenced by the median  number of cases from 2006 through 2016 (median, 1,176; range, 896 to 1,431)  compared to the median from 1996 to 2005 (median, 464; range, 252 to 1,023).  Eight hundred one (62%) confirmed  cases in 2016 were male. The median age of cases was 49 years (range, 1 to 100  years). Physician-diagnosed erythema migrans (EM) was present in 973 (75%) cases.  Four hundred one (31%) cases had one or more late manifestations of Lyme  disease (including 262 with a history of objective joint swelling, 115 with  cranial neuritis including Bell’s Palsy, 21 with acute onset of 2nd or 3rd  degree atrioventricular conduction defects, 9 with lymphocytic meningitis, and  4 with radiculoneuropathy) and confirmation by Western immunoblot (positive IgM  ≤30 days post-onset or positive IgG). Of the 1,200 cases with known onset  dates, onset of symptoms peaked from June through August, with 61% of EM cases  experiencing symptom onset in June or July. This timing corresponds with peak  activity of nymphal I. scapularis ticks in mid- May through mid-July.  The majority of cases either resided in or traveled to endemic counties in north-central,  east-central, or southeast Minnesota, or Wisconsin.

The culprit, shown, was a nymph that wasn’t carrying disease-causing bacteria and had only a bit of blood in its belly, according to the lab that tested it.      Courtesy of Meghan Rosen      I thought it was just a scab. The brown speck clinging to my baby’s cheek had been there for a day or so, resting on a reddish patch of skin. He must have scratched himself, I thought, as I picked lightly at the mark. My husband was the first to figure out the truth. That little round speck wasn’t a scab at all — it was a tick. I had recently read a scary article about ticks (complete with scary title: “ Be Very Afraid of Ticks ”), and I was terrified. We plucked the bug off the baby, stored it in a plastic baggie and popped it into the freezer. But what next? Head to the ER? Get a blood test for Lyme disease? Start him on antibiotics in case he was infected? None of the above, says pediatric infectious disease specialist Sunil Sood, of Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in Hempstead, N.Y. “It’s all overkill,” he says. A lot of parents panic when they spot a tick on their child because they think first of Lyme disease , a bacterial illness that can hit people with headaches, fevers, arthritis and even paralysis of the face. After hearing Sood talk about ticks on The Diane Rehm Show , I talked with him and with infectious disease physician Paul Mead about what parents need to know. 1. Not all ticks carry Lyme disease. A nasty little spiral-shaped bacteria called Borrelia  burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. It hitches a ride in the guts of some, but not all, tick species. After an infected tick sinks its mouth parts into a person’s skin and begins to feed, the bacteria mosey up from the gut to the tick’s salivary glands and into the person.   But a tick has to be attached for a long time before the bacteria make their way into the body — somewhere in the window of 36 to 48 hours . So if you find a tick crawling on your kid, you’re probably fine: There’s a good chance it hasn’t yet latched on and delivered the bacteria. Blacklegged ticks, or deer ticks, are the main carriers of Borrelia bacteria. So if your child has a brown dog tick, a Rocky Mountain wood tick, or a lone star tick (Baby S’s buddy), you don’t have to worry about Lyme disease. But these other types of ticks can carry different kinds of disease-causing bacteria, so it’s good to know which tick you’re dealing with, Sood says. “Parents should always remember to save the tick,” he says. “That’s the most important thing.” To figure out which kind of tick bit you or your loved one, you can look at pictures on the CDC’s website , or send the tick to an insect identification lab. (We snapped an iPhone pic of Baby S’s tick and e-mailed it to the USDA , which identifies ticks for free.) 2. There’s no need to get the tick tested for diseases. Several labs offer tick-testing services. These facilities will grind the tick up and look for DNA from Borrelia or other disease-causing bacteria. Testing sounded logical to me, so I shelled out 50 bucks to a zoology lab * in Massachusetts and sent off Baby S’s tick. I was hugely relieved when the test results came back negative. That meant Baby S was safe, right? Not necessarily . “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money,” Sood says. Blood in the tick’s belly can interfere with the test results, so the tick could test negative even if it’s carrying harmful bacteria. A positive test isn’t all that telling either. A tick that’s positive for Borrelia hasn’t necessarily passed the bacteria on to the bitten child. What’s more, if the lab destroys the tick without identifying it first, doctors won’t know which disease symptoms to look for, Sood says.  “I don’t want to be looking for Lyme disease when it was a lone star tick,” he says. (* See note below for an update on this point.) 3. Lyme disease doesn’t always cause the hallmark bull’s-eye rash. But nearly 90 percent of kids with Lyme disease do develop a rash at the bite site. The rash is a roughly circular red splotch that gradually grows bigger over time. In some kids, more than one splotch shows up. It can take a month to appear, so parents should stay watchful. For kids who don’t get a rash, look for fever and other flulike symptoms in the warm months, from April to November, Sood says. Since we knew that a lone star tick bit Baby S, we watched for symptoms of ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , both potentially fatal diseases. (They can be hard to spot in infants, so if he had become feverish, knowing the type of tick that bit him would have been helpful information for his pediatrician.) 4. Lyme disease is generally easy to treat. The odds of getting Lyme disease from an individual deer tick bite are pretty low: Even in tick-ridden areas, less than 5 percent of bites result in an infection. But those that do are easy to deal with, Sood says. “Lyme disease is completely treatable. All the symptoms literally melt away with antibiotics.” “I’m actually more worried about mosquito bites than tick bites,” he says. Catching the problem early can make treatment easier, says Paul Mead, an infectious disease physician at the Centers for Disease Control in Fort Collins, Colo. But, he says, “the vast majority of patients who have Lyme disease will recover and do just fine.” Still, about 4 to 5 percent of people who get treated have symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle aches and trouble sleeping, that linger for more than six months. The condition, named post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome , or PTLDS, is commonly known as “chronic Lyme disease,” and on the Internet, it’s a notoriously thorny subject. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there,” Mead says. No one really knows what causes the symptoms. People could be having a delayed immune response, or they may have an undiagnosed illness that’s to blame. But scientists do know that lengthy courses of antibiotics don’t seem to help. “People should be skeptical if providers are telling them that they need to be on months and years of antibiotics,” Mead says. Very few ­— if any — people actually die from Lyme disease. One 2012 study found that from 1999 to 2003, only 23 death certificates listed Lyme disease as the underlying cause (and perhaps only one of those people actually had the disease). During the same time period, the CDC recorded more than 96,000 cases of the disease. But not every case gets reported, Mead says. The CDC estimates that the number of Americans diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is actually around 300,000 . 5. There are a few good ways to prevent tick bites. First, if kids play outside, check them daily for ticks, making sure to inspect easy-to-miss nooks and crannies like the armpits, groin and scalp. Bathing with a washcloth is a simple and effective way to sweep ticks from the skin before they’ve latched on. Bug repellents like DEET and permethrin can help keep ticks away. For kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends formulations with 10 to 30 percent DEET (although Canada’s public health department thinks kids should stick to formulations with 10 percent DEET or less). If you do find a tick that’s attached, remove it right away. A pair of thin-tipped tweezers and an empty container will do the trick, Sood says. “It’s nothing fancy,” he says. Grasp the tick at the mouth end, and pull straight up. “Gentle, steady pressure, and it will generally pop right out,” Sood says. I’m much less panicked about ticks now than I was when one was hanging off Baby S’s face. But I do worry that I might not notice one hiding out in some cozy crevice of his skin. And the problem isn’t likely to go away: The number of Lyme cases might go up as the climate changes and ticks have more warm, woodsy places to live. I know our family needs to be especially vigilant: We live in an area that keeps erupting with new cases. Montgomery County, Maryland, ranked 27th out of more than 3,000 U.S. counties in the number of Lyme disease cases tallied up from 2007 to 2011. It’s number one in Maryland. (You can check out the map in this paper to see if you live in a high-risk area, look at this CDC Excel spreadsheet to see how your county fares, or read more about the CDC’s maps here .) Still, I’m trying to ratchet down my fear level from super-freak-out-panic to something in the neighborhood of responsibly concerned. “I don’t think being alarmed is helpful,” Mead says. “People should be aware of the problem, and know what to do protect themselves.” I’m not ready to douse my family’s clothing in bug repellent just yet, but I have vowed to do daily tick checks and wash well after playing outdoors. And next time, if I see a funny-looking scab on my kids’ skin, I’m checking to see if it has legs. *Update, 4 p.m., August 21, 2015: Microbiologist Stephen Rich of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology (the lab that tested Baby S’s tick) at the University of Massachusetts took issue with Sunil Sood’s statement that “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money.” Rich explained that the lab tests are not intended to diagnose human disease.  Instead, he notes, one of the big benefits is disease surveillance.  In addition to identifying deer ticks, dog ticks, lone star ticks and the diseases they may carry, TickReport makes data available to the public. He makes a good point.  Baby S’s tick was one of 272 ticks the lab has tested from Maryland — five of which came from my zip code alone (none of the five tested positive for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease). So people can use the data to glean info about potential risk in their area. Sood’s point was that testing a tick for bacteria is not a good way to find out if a bitten child was infected. But I agree that there’s certainly value to the information collected from testing ticks and tracking tick bites.      View the discussion thread.

KidsHealth / For Parents / How Do I Watch for Lyme Disease After Removing a Tick?     Print I found a tick on my daughter's arm last night. I pulled it off, but I have no idea how long it had been there, as she plays outside every day. What should I do? How do I tell if the tick gave her Lyme disease? – Mara  Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted primarily by deer ticks. In the United States, Lyme disease is most common in the Northeast, Northwest, and parts of the upper Midwest. So where you live (or travel) and what type of tick you find will help determine if your child is at risk of developing Lyme disease.  Not all deer ticks are infected with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. And a tick that is infected has to be attached to a person's skin for at least 24-48 hours before it can transmit that bacteria. Since you don't know how long the tick was attached, watch for signs that your daughter might be developing the illness.  Many kids who have Lyme disease develop a red rash at the site of the tick bite, which sometimes has a characteristic "bull's-eye" appearance. In the week or two after the tick bite, look for an expanding ring of solid redness or a red bump surrounded by clear skin that is ringed by an expanding red rash. The rash may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle and joint aches.  If she has a bull's-eye rash or other symptoms that can happen in Lyme disease, call your doctor right away. Early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease can prevent serious illness and long-term complications. When diagnosed quickly and given a course of antibiotics, kids with Lyme disease almost always have a good outcome.  Parents can help prevent kids from being exposed to ticks by making sure they wear protective clothing and apply insect repellant containing DEET, especially when playing in grassy or wooded areas where ticks live. Check kids for ticks every day.

Transmission             Recommend on Facebook   Tweet   Share Compartir               The Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi , is spread through the bite of infected ticks. The blacklegged tick (or deer tick, Ixodes scapularis ) spreads the disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States. The western blacklegged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ) spreads the disease on the Pacific Coast. Ticks can attach to any part of the human body but are often found in hard-to-see areas such as the groin, armpits, and scalp. In most cases, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. Most humans are infected through the bites of immature ticks called nymphs. Nymphs are tiny (less than 2 mm) and difficult to see; they feed during the spring and summer months. Adult ticks can also transmit Lyme disease bacteria, but they are much larger and are more likely to be discovered and removed before they have had time to transmit the bacteria. Adult Ixodes ticks are most active during the cooler months of the year.   Relative sizes of blacklegged ticks at different life stages       In general, adult ticks are approximately the size of a sesame seed and nymphal ticks are approximately the size of a poppy seed.              Are there other ways to get Lyme disease?      There is no evidence that Lyme disease is transmitted from person-to-person. For example, a person cannot get infected from touching, kissing, or having sex with a person who has Lyme disease. Lyme disease acquired during pregnancy may lead to infection of the placenta and possible stillbirth; however, no negative effects on the fetus have been found when the mother receives appropriate antibiotic treatment. There are no reports of Lyme disease transmission from breast milk. Although no cases of Lyme disease have been linked to blood transfusion, scientists have found that the Lyme disease bacteria can live in blood that is stored for donation. Individuals being treated for Lyme disease with an antibiotic should not donate blood. Individuals who have completed antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease may be considered as potential blood donors. Information on the current criteria for blood donation is available on the Red Cross website . Although dogs and cats can get Lyme disease, there is no evidence that they spread the disease directly to their owners. However, pets can bring infected ticks into your home or yard. Consider protecting your pet, and possibly yourself, through the use of tick control products for animals. You will not get Lyme disease from eating venison or squirrel meat, but in keeping with general food safety principles, always cook meat thoroughly. Note that hunting and dressing deer or squirrels may bring you into close contact with infected ticks. There is no credible evidence that Lyme disease can be transmitted through air, food, water, or from the bites of mosquitoes, flies, fleas, or lice. Ticks not known to transmit Lyme disease include Lone star ticks ( Amblyomma americanum ), the American dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ), the Rocky Mountain wood tick ( Dermacentor andersoni ), and the brown dog tick ( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ).      How ticks find their hosts      Ticks can't fly or jump. Instead, they wait for a host, resting on the tips of grasses and shrubs in a position known as "questing". While questing, ticks hold onto leaves and grass by their lower legs. They hold their upper pair of legs outstretched, waiting to climb onto a passing host. When a host brushes the spot where a tick is waiting, it quickly climbs aboard. It then finds a suitable place to bite its host.      How ticks attach to their hosts      The tick feeding process makes ticks very good at transmitting infection: Depending on the tick species and its stage of life, preparing to feed can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours. When the tick finds a feeding spot, it grasps the skin and cuts into the surface. The tick then inserts its feeding tube. Many species also secrete a cement-like substance that keeps them firmly attached during the meal. The feeding tube can have barbs, which help keep the tick in place. Ticks also can secrete small amounts of saliva with anesthetic properties so that the animal or person can't feel that the tick has attached itself. If the tick is in a sheltered spot, it can go unnoticed. A blacklegged tick will attach to its host and suck the blood slowly for several days. If the host animal has certain bloodborne infections, such as the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, the tick may ingest the pathogen and become infected. If the tick later feeds on a human, that human can become infected. After feeding, the blacklegged tick drops off and prepares for the next life stage. At its next feeding, it can then transmit the infection to the new host. Once infected, a tick can transmit infection throughout its life. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease. It takes some time for the Lyme disease-causing bacteria to move from the tick to the host. The longer the tick is attached, the greater the risk of acquiring disease from it.      Lifecycle of blacklegged ticks      The lifecycle of blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus ) generally lasts two years. During this time, they go through four life stages: egg, six-legged larva, eight-legged nymph, and adult. After the eggs hatch, the ticks must have a blood meal at every stage to survive. Blacklegged ticks can feed from mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The ticks need to have a new host at each stage of their life, as shown below:      This diagram shows the lifecycle of blacklegged ticks that can transmit Lyme disease.

Home » Harvard Health Blog » Lyme disease 10 times more common than thought - Harvard Health Blog   Lyme disease 10 times more common than thought  Posted August 20, 2013, 1:36 pm   Patrick J. Skerrett Former Executive Editor, Harvard Health        The 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year are just the tip of the iceberg. According to a new CDC estimate , more than 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with the tick-borne disease each year. The new number was presented at the 2013 International Conference on Lyme Borreliosis and Other Tick-Borne Diseases , being held in Boston.  Although the new numbers may be an overestimate, they still provide a clearer picture of the impact of Lyme disease in the United States, says Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, a rheumatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Instead of relying mainly on cases reported by doctors, a standard public health approach, CDC researchers are trying to get a more complete picture of Lyme infections by sifting through health insurance claims, analyzing data from clinical laboratories (which do the tests necessary to diagnose Lyme disease), and surveying the public for self-reported Lyme disease.  “We know that routine surveillance only gives us part of the picture, and that the true number of illnesses is much greater,” said Paul Mead, M.D., chief of epidemiology and surveillance for CDC’s Lyme disease program, in a statement. “This new preliminary estimate confirms that Lyme disease is a tremendous public health problem in the United States, and clearly highlights the urgent need for prevention.”  Although Lyme disease has been diagnosed in almost every state , most cases reported to the CDC are in the Northeast and upper Midwest—96% of cases come from 13 states.  The aftermath of a tick bite  Lyme disease is a zoonotic disease , meaning a disease spread between animals and humans. It is caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which lives in mice and deer. These corkscrew-shaped bacteria, called spirochetes, get into black-legged ticks when they feed on an infected animal. They migrate to the tick’s salivary glands, and, if the tick bites a person, are injected into the bloodstream. An excellent illustration by The Boston Globe depicts this life cycle.  In some people, the immune system destroys the bacteria before they can do any damage. In others, they grow and multiply, causing an infection. Symptoms include a bull’s-eye-shaped rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. Treatment with antibiotics can usually prevent any short- or long-term repercussions, says Dr. Shmerling.  If the infection isn’t treated, problems can develop in other parts of the body, including the joints, heart, and nerves. It can also cause arthritis that persists months or years after the tick bite.  Some people with Lyme disease and some doctors have argued that Borrelia burgdorferi can somehow evade courses of antibiotics and become a chronic infection that needs long-term antibiotic treatment—even though conventional antibody tests are negative. Chronic Lyme disease has been blamed for causing pain, fatigue, muscle aches, loss of memory and thinking skills, and a host of other problems.  A Boston Globe series, “Bitten By Uncertainty,” has been exploring this controversial side of Lyme disease.  Prevention is key  Like most communicable diseases, Lyme disease is largely preventable, says Dr. Shmerling. Avoid being bitten by a blacklegged tick (also known as a deer tick) and you won’t get Lyme disease. There are two main ways to do that—stay out of brush and high grass in and around wooded areas, or get out in nature and protect yourself. Here are six tips for protecting yourself from ticks, adapted from the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station’s comprehensive handbook about tick management .  1. Wear light-colored clothing. Light colors make ticks easier to spot, especially tiny deer tick nymphs.  2. Tuck your pants inside your socks. It may not be a flattering look, but it creates a physical barrier against ticks.  3. Use insect repellent. Most of the chemicals that repel mosquitoes are somewhat effective against ticks, although it may take a heavier concentration of DEET—between 30% and 40%—to really keep them away. Permethrin is a stronger chemical that kills ticks as well as repels them. Products containing permethrin should be sprayed on clothes , not on the skin. Picaridin repels mosquitoes and other insects but not ticks.  4. Stay in the middle of the path (or fairway). Ticks can’t fly or jump, so they can only get on you if you come into contact with the kind of environment they live in: moist, often shady, wooded areas, with leaves, low-lying plants, and shrubs.  5. Think sunny. Ticks don’t do well in dry, open areas. Lawn furniture and playground equipment should be set back from the edge of wooded, shady areas. If you’re picnicking, pick a patch of well-tended lawn or some open ground.  6. Inspect yourself and your children (and your pets), especially the legs and groin. Ticks usually get picked up on the lower legs and then climb upward in search of a meal. The odds of contracting Lyme or other tick-borne disease are minimized if a tick is removed soon after it’s attached, and there’s no risk if it’s still crawling around. The shower is a good place to conduct a tick check. Feel for any new bumps on soaped-up skin.  And if you do get bitten by a tick, remove it using the method recommended by the CDC : Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. Then pull it out with a steady motion. Once the tick has been removed, clean the skin with soap and water. Dispose of the tick, which is probably still alive, by placing it in alcohol or flushing it down the toilet.

Your article has truly peaked my interest. I will take a note of your website and keep checking for new details about once a week. I opted in for your Feed as well.         Posted September 16th, 2013 at 9:33 am  Michelle    I will never forget when I was a kid, my Dad pulled a tick from the base of my neck, and then set fire to it. It scorched a place of my Mom’s hard wood floor. She never did find out where it came from.  I got the tick from fishing with my Dad on the previous day, so I was ordered to silence. The tick was engorged and I had no idea it was there.         Posted September 4th, 2013 at 10:09 pm  Janet Barry    While my daughter’s father-in-law is being treated for Lyme disease in CT, one of my dogs has been exposed to Lyme disease in Poway (San Diego County) this summer. I have never heard of it here in our area, but apparently it is here to stay. This occurred in my own backyard. A routine test for heartworm from my vet showed this exposure. People on the west coast think they and their animals are immune, but that is not the case. Get tested, and have your animals tested if you find ticks or the “red ring” on your body. I hear it is extremely painful.         Posted August 22nd, 2013 at 10:59 am  Prabodhan    Which insect repellent, will you advise.         Posted August 20th, 2013 at 6:14 pm  Science    It’s sad to see such bad maths. The CDC writes that 300 000 is “10 times higher than” 30 000. But the expression means 11 times. CDC being rather an important body should know better but while it may be excusable for them, I really expect more from a world reknowned institution like Harvard. “Lyme disease 10 times more common than thought” should be “Lyme disease 10 times as common as thought”. I would also add the word “previously” before “thought”.         Posted August 23rd, 2013 at 6:10 pm  Joe    Seriously? Isn’t life too short for this kind of stuff?

Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.  You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying the disease thrive. It's important to take common-sense precautions in areas where ticks are prevalent.      Symptoms    Lyme disease rash Lyme disease rash People with Lyme disease may experience a characteristic bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and may eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across.      The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary and usually appear in stages.  Early signs and symptoms  A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease.  However, these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected:    Rash. From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull’s-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It is typically not itchy or painful.  Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.   Flu-like symptoms. Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches and a headache may accompany the rash.   Later signs and symptoms  If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include:   Erythema migrans appearing in other areas of your body.  Joint pain. Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another.  Neurological problems. Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement.   Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium Borrelia mayonii may also include:   Nausea and vomiting  Diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease)   Less common signs and symptoms  Several weeks after infection, some people develop:   Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat. Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks.  Eye inflammation.  Liver inflammation (hepatitis).  Severe fatigue.   When to see a doctor  If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms  Only a minority of blacklegged tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.  If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease — particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent — contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.  See your doctor even if symptoms disappear  It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear — the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems. Ticks also can transmit other illnesses, such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Deer tick Deer tick The deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) goes through three life stages. Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.      In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii bacteria, carried primarily by blacklegged or deer ticks. The ticks are brown and, when young, often no bigger than a poppy seed, which can make them nearly impossible to spot.  To contract Lyme disease, an infected deer tick must bite you. The bacteria enter your skin through the bite and eventually make their way into your bloodstream. In most cases, to transmit Lyme disease, a deer tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours. If you find an attached tick looks swollen, it may have fed long enough to transmit bacteria. Removing the tick as soon as possible may prevent infection.  Risk factors Where you live or vacation can affect your chances of getting Lyme disease. So can your profession and the outdoor activities you enjoy. The most common risk factors for Lyme disease include:    Spending time in wooded or grassy areas. In the United States, deer ticks are most prevalent in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which have heavily wooded areas where deer ticks thrive. Children who spend a lot of time outdoors in these regions are especially at risk. Adults with outdoor occupations also are at increased risk.  In the first two stages of life, deer ticks in the United States feed on mice and other rodents, which are a prime reservoir for Lyme disease bacteria. Adult deer ticks feed primarily on white-tailed deer.   Having exposed skin. Ticks attach easily to bare flesh. If you're in an area where ticks are common, protect yourself and your children by wearing long sleeves and long pants. Don't allow your pets to wander in tall weeds and grasses.  Not removing ticks promptly or properly. Bacteria from a tick bite can enter your bloodstream if the tick stays attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours or longer. If you remove a tick within two days, your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low.   Complications Left untreated, Lyme disease can cause:   Chronic joint inflammation (Lyme arthritis), particularly of the knee  Neurological symptoms, such as facial palsy and neuropathy  Cognitive defects, such as impaired memory  Heart rhythm irregularities   Prevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:   Cover up. When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.  Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouth. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.  Do your best to tick-proof your yard. Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Keep woodpiles in sunny areas.   Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin, so you may not discover them unless you search carefully.  It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.   Don't assume you're immune. You can get Lyme disease more than once.  Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick, but pull carefully and steadily. Once you've removed the entire tick, dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.

Lyme disease is spread by the bite of an infected tick. In the United States, an estimated 300,000 infections occur each year. If you camp, hike, work, or play in wooded or grassy places, you could be bitten by an infected tick.  People living in or visiting New England, the mid-Atlantic states, and the upper Midwest are at greatest risk. But you and your family can prevent tick bites and reduce your risk of Lyme disease.  Protect Yourself from Tick Bites  Know where to expect ticks. Blacklegged ticks (the ticks that cause Lyme disease) live in moist and humid environments, particularly in and near wooded or grassy areas. You may get a tick on you during outdoor activities around your home or when walking through leaves and bushes. To avoid ticks, walk in the center of trails and avoid walking through tall bushes or other vegetation.     Though Lyme disease cases have been reported in nearly every state, cases are reported from the infected person’s county of residence, not the place where they were infected. More Lyme disease data >    Repel ticks on skin and clothing. Use repellent that contains 20 percent or more DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 on exposed skin for protection that lasts several hours. Always follow product instructions. Parents should apply this product to their children, avoiding hands, eyes, and mouth. Use products that contain permethrin on clothing. Treat clothing and gear, such as boots, pants, socks and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin. It remains protective through several washings. Pre-treated clothing is available and may be protective longer.   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has an online tool to help you select the repellent that is best for you and your family.  For detailed information about preventing ticks on pets and in your yard, see Lyme Disease Prevention and Control .  For detailed information for outdoor workers, see NIOSH Safety and Health Topic: Tick-borne Diseases .   Perform Daily Tick Checks  Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, even in your own yard. Search your entire body for ticks when you return from an area that may have ticks. Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body and remove any tick you find . Take special care to check these parts of your body and your child’s body for ticks:       Under the arms  In and around the ears  Inside the belly button  Back of the knees  In and around all head and body hair  Between the legs  Around the waist    Check your clothing and pets for ticks because they may carry ticks into the house. Check clothes and pets carefully and remove any ticks that are found. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat to kill ticks.  Remove Attached Ticks Quickly and Correctly   Remove an attached tick with fine-tipped tweezers as soon as you notice it. If a tick is attached to your skin for less than 24 hours, your chance of getting Lyme disease is extremely small; however, other diseases may be transmitted more quickly.  Over the next few weeks, watch for signs or symptoms of Lyme disease such as rash or fever. See a healthcare provider if you have signs or symptoms. For more information, see tick removal .  Be Alert for Fever or Rash  Even if you don’t remember being bitten by a tick, an unexpected summer fever or odd rash may be the first signs of Lyme disease, particularly if you’ve been in tick habitat. See your healthcare provider if you have symptoms.  Prevent Ticks on Animals  Prevent family pets from bringing ticks into the home by limiting their access to tick-infested areas and by using veterinarian-prescribed tick collars or spot-on treatment.  Create Tick-safe Zones in Your Yard  Modify your landscaping to create “Tick-Safe Zones.” It’s pretty simple. Keep patios, play areas, and playground equipment away from shrubs, bushes, and other vegetation. Regularly remove leaves, clear tall grasses and brush around your home, and place wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas to keep ticks away from recreational areas (and away from you).   Use a chemical control agent. Effective tick control chemicals are available for homeowners to use, or a professional pest control expert can apply them.  Discourage deer. Deer are the main food source of adult ticks. Keep deer away from your home by removing plants that attract deer and by constructing barriers (like a fence) to discourage deer from entering your yard and bringing ticks with them. ​    More Information  Disease of the Week – Lyme Disease         Features Media   Sign up for Features     Get Email Updates  To receive email updates about this page, enter your email address:    Enter Email Address   Enter Email Address  What's this?

Courtesy of Meghan Rosen      I thought it was just a scab. The brown speck clinging to my baby’s cheek had been there for a day or so, resting on a reddish patch of skin. He must have scratched himself, I thought, as I picked lightly at the mark. My husband was the first to figure out the truth. That little round speck wasn’t a scab at all — it was a tick. I had recently read a scary article about ticks (complete with scary title: “ Be Very Afraid of Ticks ”), and I was terrified. We plucked the bug off the baby, stored it in a plastic baggie and popped it into the freezer. But what next? Head to the ER? Get a blood test for Lyme disease? Start him on antibiotics in case he was infected? None of the above, says pediatric infectious disease specialist Sunil Sood, of Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in Hempstead, N.Y. “It’s all overkill,” he says. A lot of parents panic when they spot a tick on their child because they think first of Lyme disease , a bacterial illness that can hit people with headaches, fevers, arthritis and even paralysis of the face. After hearing Sood talk about ticks on The Diane Rehm Show , I talked with him and with infectious disease physician Paul Mead about what parents need to know. 1. Not all ticks carry Lyme disease. A nasty little spiral-shaped bacteria called Borrelia  burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. It hitches a ride in the guts of some, but not all, tick species. After an infected tick sinks its mouth parts into a person’s skin and begins to feed, the bacteria mosey up from the gut to the tick’s salivary glands and into the person.   But a tick has to be attached for a long time before the bacteria make their way into the body — somewhere in the window of 36 to 48 hours . So if you find a tick crawling on your kid, you’re probably fine: There’s a good chance it hasn’t yet latched on and delivered the bacteria. Blacklegged ticks, or deer ticks, are the main carriers of Borrelia bacteria. So if your child has a brown dog tick, a Rocky Mountain wood tick, or a lone star tick (Baby S’s buddy), you don’t have to worry about Lyme disease. But these other types of ticks can carry different kinds of disease-causing bacteria, so it’s good to know which tick you’re dealing with, Sood says. “Parents should always remember to save the tick,” he says. “That’s the most important thing.” To figure out which kind of tick bit you or your loved one, you can look at pictures on the CDC’s website , or send the tick to an insect identification lab. (We snapped an iPhone pic of Baby S’s tick and e-mailed it to the USDA , which identifies ticks for free.) 2. There’s no need to get the tick tested for diseases. Several labs offer tick-testing services. These facilities will grind the tick up and look for DNA from Borrelia or other disease-causing bacteria. Testing sounded logical to me, so I shelled out 50 bucks to a zoology lab * in Massachusetts and sent off Baby S’s tick. I was hugely relieved when the test results came back negative. That meant Baby S was safe, right? Not necessarily . “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money,” Sood says. Blood in the tick’s belly can interfere with the test results, so the tick could test negative even if it’s carrying harmful bacteria. A positive test isn’t all that telling either. A tick that’s positive for Borrelia hasn’t necessarily passed the bacteria on to the bitten child. What’s more, if the lab destroys the tick without identifying it first, doctors won’t know which disease symptoms to look for, Sood says.  “I don’t want to be looking for Lyme disease when it was a lone star tick,” he says. (* See note below for an update on this point.) 3. Lyme disease doesn’t always cause the hallmark bull’s-eye rash. But nearly 90 percent of kids with Lyme disease do develop a rash at the bite site. The rash is a roughly circular red splotch that gradually grows bigger over time. In some kids, more than one splotch shows up. It can take a month to appear, so parents should stay watchful. For kids who don’t get a rash, look for fever and other flulike symptoms in the warm months, from April to November, Sood says. Since we knew that a lone star tick bit Baby S, we watched for symptoms of ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , both potentially fatal diseases. (They can be hard to spot in infants, so if he had become feverish, knowing the type of tick that bit him would have been helpful information for his pediatrician.) 4. Lyme disease is generally easy to treat. The odds of getting Lyme disease from an individual deer tick bite are pretty low: Even in tick-ridden areas, less than 5 percent of bites result in an infection. But those that do are easy to deal with, Sood says. “Lyme disease is completely treatable. All the symptoms literally melt away with antibiotics.” “I’m actually more worried about mosquito bites than tick bites,” he says. Catching the problem early can make treatment easier, says Paul Mead, an infectious disease physician at the Centers for Disease Control in Fort Collins, Colo. But, he says, “the vast majority of patients who have Lyme disease will recover and do just fine.” Still, about 4 to 5 percent of people who get treated have symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle aches and trouble sleeping, that linger for more than six months. The condition, named post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome , or PTLDS, is commonly known as “chronic Lyme disease,” and on the Internet, it’s a notoriously thorny subject. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there,” Mead says. No one really knows what causes the symptoms. People could be having a delayed immune response, or they may have an undiagnosed illness that’s to blame. But scientists do know that lengthy courses of antibiotics don’t seem to help. “People should be skeptical if providers are telling them that they need to be on months and years of antibiotics,” Mead says. Very few ­— if any — people actually die from Lyme disease. One 2012 study found that from 1999 to 2003, only 23 death certificates listed Lyme disease as the underlying cause (and perhaps only one of those people actually had the disease). During the same time period, the CDC recorded more than 96,000 cases of the disease. But not every case gets reported, Mead says. The CDC estimates that the number of Americans diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is actually around 300,000 . 5. There are a few good ways to prevent tick bites. First, if kids play outside, check them daily for ticks, making sure to inspect easy-to-miss nooks and crannies like the armpits, groin and scalp. Bathing with a washcloth is a simple and effective way to sweep ticks from the skin before they’ve latched on. Bug repellents like DEET and permethrin can help keep ticks away. For kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends formulations with 10 to 30 percent DEET (although Canada’s public health department thinks kids should stick to formulations with 10 percent DEET or less). If you do find a tick that’s attached, remove it right away. A pair of thin-tipped tweezers and an empty container will do the trick, Sood says. “It’s nothing fancy,” he says. Grasp the tick at the mouth end, and pull straight up. “Gentle, steady pressure, and it will generally pop right out,” Sood says. I’m much less panicked about ticks now than I was when one was hanging off Baby S’s face. But I do worry that I might not notice one hiding out in some cozy crevice of his skin. And the problem isn’t likely to go away: The number of Lyme cases might go up as the climate changes and ticks have more warm, woodsy places to live. I know our family needs to be especially vigilant: We live in an area that keeps erupting with new cases. Montgomery County, Maryland, ranked 27th out of more than 3,000 U.S. counties in the number of Lyme disease cases tallied up from 2007 to 2011. It’s number one in Maryland. (You can check out the map in this paper to see if you live in a high-risk area, look at this CDC Excel spreadsheet to see how your county fares, or read more about the CDC’s maps here .) Still, I’m trying to ratchet down my fear level from super-freak-out-panic to something in the neighborhood of responsibly concerned. “I don’t think being alarmed is helpful,” Mead says. “People should be aware of the problem, and know what to do protect themselves.” I’m not ready to douse my family’s clothing in bug repellent just yet, but I have vowed to do daily tick checks and wash well after playing outdoors. And next time, if I see a funny-looking scab on my kids’ skin, I’m checking to see if it has legs. *Update, 4 p.m., August 21, 2015: Microbiologist Stephen Rich of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology (the lab that tested Baby S’s tick) at the University of Massachusetts took issue with Sunil Sood’s statement that “Testing for bacteria is a waste of time and money.” Rich explained that the lab tests are not intended to diagnose human disease.  Instead, he notes, one of the big benefits is disease surveillance.  In addition to identifying deer ticks, dog ticks, lone star ticks and the diseases they may carry, TickReport makes data available to the public. He makes a good point.  Baby S’s tick was one of 272 ticks the lab has tested from Maryland — five of which came from my zip code alone (none of the five tested positive for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease). So people can use the data to glean info about potential risk in their area. Sood’s point was that testing a tick for bacteria is not a good way to find out if a bitten child was infected. But I agree that there’s certainly value to the information collected from testing ticks and tracking tick bites.      View the discussion thread.

KidsHealth / For Teens / What's My Lyme Disease Risk? What's in this article? What Areas Are Most Affected? Outdoor Activities and Pets Can Lyme Disease Be Prevented? How Do I Remove a Tick?     Print en español ¿Cuál es mi riesgo de contraer la enfermedad de Lyme? Is the thought of Lyme disease making you feel you'd be safer in the comfort of your room rather than the great outdoors? Before you download a summer-long supply of games and apps, here's some information to help you know if you're at risk for Lyme disease.  What Areas Are Most Affected?  Lyme disease is the leading tick-borne (carried by ticks) disease in the United States. Experts think that some cases of Lyme disease aren't found because some people don't know that they have it.  Nearly all cases of Lyme disease in the United States happen in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal states. Lyme disease has been reported in other states (and even in Asia, Europe, and Canada), but those hardest hit are:   Connecticut  Delaware  Maine  Massachusetts  Maryland  Minnesota  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island  Wisconsin  Vermont  Virginia   Outdoor Activities and Pets  Besides living in one of these areas, other things that might increase your risk include:   spending a lot of time outdoors in tall grass, brush, shrubs, or wooded areas  having pets that may carry ticks indoors  activities such as yardwork, hiking, camping, fishing, or hunting in tick-infested areas       Can Lyme Disease Be Prevented?  So you got a job as a landscaper this summer and you're planning a big camping trip. Take these precautions to protect yourself:   Wear closed shoes or boots, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants.  Tuck your pants into shoes or boots to prevent ticks from crawling up your legs.  Wear light-colored clothing to help you see ticks easily.  Keep long hair pulled back or wear a hat for added protection.  When outside, don't sit on the ground.  Use an insect repellent containing 10% to 30% DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide).  While outdoors, check yourself for ticks often. Check again after you go back inside (don't forget to check pets too).  Wash all clothes after leaving tick-infested areas, and thoroughly shampoo your hair to eliminate any unseen ticks.   If you use insect repellents containing DEET, follow the instructions on the product's label. Don't put on too much. Using more product than you need won't increase your protection.  Place DEET on shirt collars and sleeves and pants cuffs, and only use it directly on exposed areas of skin. Be sure to wash it off when you go back indoors. Don't spray aerosol or pump products containing DEET directly onto your face; instead, spray it on your hands and rub it into your face. How Do I Remove a Tick?  You should know how to remove a tick just in case one lands on you or a friend.  First, don't panic. Your risk of developing Lyme disease after being bitten by a tick is low. And it takes at least 24–48 hours for the tick to transmit the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. To be safe, remove the tick as soon as possible.  If you find a tick:   Call your doctor, who may want you to save the tick after removal so that the tick can later be identified as the type that may carry Lyme disease. You can put the tick in a sealed container to preserve it.  Use tweezers to grasp the tick firmly at its head or mouth, next to your skin.  Pull firmly and steadily on the tick until it lets go of the skin. If part of the tick stays in your skin, don't worry. It will eventually come out — although you should call your doctor if you notice any irritation in the area or symptoms of Lyme disease.  Swab the bite site with alcohol.   Note: Don't use petroleum jelly or a lit match to kill a tick. They won't get the tick off your skin quickly enough, and may just cause it to burrow deeper into your skin.

Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.  You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying the disease thrive. It's important to take common-sense precautions in areas where ticks are prevalent.      Symptoms    Lyme disease rash Lyme disease rash People with Lyme disease may experience a characteristic bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and may eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across.      The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary and usually appear in stages.  Early signs and symptoms  A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease.  However, these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected:    Rash. From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull’s-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It is typically not itchy or painful.  Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.   Flu-like symptoms. Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches and a headache may accompany the rash.   Later signs and symptoms  If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include:   Erythema migrans appearing in other areas of your body.  Joint pain. Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another.  Neurological problems. Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement.   Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium Borrelia mayonii may also include:   Nausea and vomiting  Diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease)   Less common signs and symptoms  Several weeks after infection, some people develop:   Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat. Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks.  Eye inflammation.  Liver inflammation (hepatitis).  Severe fatigue.   When to see a doctor  If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms  Only a minority of blacklegged tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.  If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease — particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent — contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.  See your doctor even if symptoms disappear  It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear — the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems. Ticks also can transmit other illnesses, such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes    Deer tick Deer tick The deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) goes through three life stages. Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.      In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii bacteria, carried primarily by blacklegged or deer ticks. The ticks are brown and, when young, often no bigger than a poppy seed, which can make them nearly impossible to spot.  To contract Lyme disease, an infected deer tick must bite you. The bacteria enter your skin through the bite and eventually make their way into your bloodstream. In most cases, to transmit Lyme disease, a deer tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours. If you find an attached tick looks swollen, it may have fed long enough to transmit bacteria. Removing the tick as soon as possible may prevent infection.  Risk factors Where you live or vacation can affect your chances of getting Lyme disease. So can your profession and the outdoor activities you enjoy. The most common risk factors for Lyme disease include:    Spending time in wooded or grassy areas. In the United States, deer ticks are most prevalent in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which have heavily wooded areas where deer ticks thrive. Children who spend a lot of time outdoors in these regions are especially at risk. Adults with outdoor occupations also are at increased risk.  In the first two stages of life, deer ticks in the United States feed on mice and other rodents, which are a prime reservoir for Lyme disease bacteria. Adult deer ticks feed primarily on white-tailed deer.   Having exposed skin. Ticks attach easily to bare flesh. If you're in an area where ticks are common, protect yourself and your children by wearing long sleeves and long pants. Don't allow your pets to wander in tall weeds and grasses.  Not removing ticks promptly or properly. Bacteria from a tick bite can enter your bloodstream if the tick stays attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours or longer. If you remove a tick within two days, your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low.   Complications Left untreated, Lyme disease can cause:   Chronic joint inflammation (Lyme arthritis), particularly of the knee  Neurological symptoms, such as facial palsy and neuropathy  Cognitive defects, such as impaired memory  Heart rhythm irregularities   Prevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:   Cover up. When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.  Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouth. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.  Do your best to tick-proof your yard. Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Keep woodpiles in sunny areas.   Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin, so you may not discover them unless you search carefully.  It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.   Don't assume you're immune. You can get Lyme disease more than once.  Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick, but pull carefully and steadily. Once you've removed the entire tick, dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.

In addition,  821 probable cases (physician-diagnosed cases that did not meet clinical  evidence criteria for a confirmed case but that had laboratory evidence of  infection) were reported. Despite some yearly fluctuations, the number of  reported cases of Lyme disease has been increasing, as evidenced by the median  number of cases from 2006 through 2016 (median, 1,176; range, 896 to 1,431)  compared to the median from 1996 to 2005 (median, 464; range, 252 to 1,023).  Eight hundred one (62%) confirmed  cases in 2016 were male. The median age of cases was 49 years (range, 1 to 100  years). Physician-diagnosed erythema migrans (EM) was present in 973 (75%) cases.  Four hundred one (31%) cases had one or more late manifestations of Lyme  disease (including 262 with a history of objective joint swelling, 115 with  cranial neuritis including Bell’s Palsy, 21 with acute onset of 2nd or 3rd  degree atrioventricular conduction defects, 9 with lymphocytic meningitis, and  4 with radiculoneuropathy) and confirmation by Western immunoblot (positive IgM  ≤30 days post-onset or positive IgG). Of the 1,200 cases with known onset  dates, onset of symptoms peaked from June through August, with 61% of EM cases  experiencing symptom onset in June or July. This timing corresponds with peak  activity of nymphal I. scapularis ticks in mid- May through mid-July.  The majority of cases either resided in or traveled to endemic counties in north-central,  east-central, or southeast Minnesota, or Wisconsin.
