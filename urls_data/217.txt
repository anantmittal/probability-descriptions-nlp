Reddit figured it out.       As the title says I've found an exploit and would prefer to speak with GGG's staff privately rather than file a public report.  Edit: Cat's out of the bag, reddit figured it out.  Uber Hillock spawns independent of the state of the zone, e.g. you don't need to reset the zone.  If you clear the zone to normal Hillock and kill him and type /remaining to check how many enemies are present you have a guidepost.  Logging and typing /remaining will spoil if Uber Hillock has spawned.  This is repeatable on one character and Uber Hillock can keep spawning.  It shortens the farm from 30-40 seconds with a 90 second cooldown to 2 seconds each time if you're slow.  This would certainly seem to be an exploit.  Edit2: I realized too late I shouldn't sell the two Onis I got this way and sold them for 50c and 1ex (with 30c change) in ASC.  This currency will remain untouched if GGG wants to destroy it.

It also depends on how they feel about it being exploited, they might be OK for you to get one as you still need to do the levelling to even get the spawn to happen, but people that are spamming it and getting multiple oni's are digging their own grave.

Because in this particular NEW & SPECIFIC case (spawn event) - we can't be sure that it's an exploit.  Why? Thanks to GGG's love of information being obscured as much as possible. -_- This backfires at them AGAIN. "Figure out how to farm Oni-Goroshi by yourself, guys. If you'd be grave wrong - we'll ban you" How about no?  GGG might have missed some stuff in their coding for Uber Hillock event - but that doesn't give them rights to insta-ban people who found it and (even) reported.  USUALLY, company should fix this "exploit" and apologize for the inconvenience. Or AT LEAST post PSA.  Remember, suffering is convenient. That is why many people prefer it.

Uhh might be the wrong thread but  Is Oni Goroshi even real ?  Suspicious because the name of the base is Charan's sword  Its drops from "Uber Hilock" - This has got to be a Joke , I meant right?? IS this like a early April's fool leak ?  I am almost level 8 and haven't seen uber hillock spawn, got 4 uniques in the mean time farming strand.. From the videos and reddit post I was under the impression that Uber hillock spawns right after you hit level 7 , may be my interpretation was incorrect.  I was under the impression that this would be an eazy leveling sword to get , so I abandoned levilign my lv 20 marauder so I cound get this sword and use it. But it seems like Charan's Uniques always have a string or a catch attached to the item, Like The goddess unleashed. You had to do so much stuff to get a pretty useless sword ( a part from good 3d art)  Now this new sword has the same art!! So its even more suspicious.  Is Charan just some rich guy trying to troll all the poe players ?  Must be rich to spend so much money just to troll players, I don't understand how GGG can allow this.  Thanks for supporting the game but I wonder how much of it is legitimately to support GGG and how much of it is to grief and troll people..

Definitely not a troll or april fools joke.    It's pretty far from useless too.  It has the same art as The Goddess Unleashed because it's a direct replacement. Unleashed had dialog only for 4 acts, when GGG added 6 more acts Charan had the sword redone. Unleashed can no longer be crafted.  Pretty damn fun to level with too. :)  Just keep grinding for it, you'll eventually get it.  "May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house."  On hiatus for the next 3 months or so.

Ialso didn't know the goddess unleashed is unobtainable now. interesting.  but I want to make it clear to everyone trying to get it that it not worth farming.  Probably more easier to hit high levels and just buy it for currency from botters  but then whats the point because this sword  looks like a league starter item..so much controversy .

( self.pathofexile ) submitted 3 months ago by maratxtv Kaom Well yesterday I got my goroshi shortly after hitting 7. Today I made two new characters for fun, got them to 7, and no uber hillock after hours.  I have a strict timer, and swap on reset. Not much time wasted.  Is there a lower chance to get a goroshi on your second char? Am I just hitting a streak of bad luck, as most people I know that got multiples consider the drop itself common; the longest part (I agree) is 6-7.  Any thoughts? thanks!   16 comments share save hide report all 16 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment!

After you can get the notable that comes after, and then the projectile damage node. Really all that matters is the MS.  Do not wear any body armor or a shield, they slow you down. Boots, Gloves, and Hats are OK.  Duel wield fast weapons, as you kill everything in one hit.  Most important item will be movespeed boots. ID all boots, use all your alchs and augs a swell.  You will also want a rustic sash + iron rings. Even white ones are good enough.  With this setup you'll be killing everything ezpz.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] DU66IE  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 months ago  (4 children) Thank you very much   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] maratxtv Kaom [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 months ago  (3 children) Anytime.

Today 2, both are at level 7 ~35%   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Xasrai witch  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago  (0 children) 3 is enough. By my calculations, after three runs are over, you only have 10-15 seconds of waiting until the first is refreshed again.  If levelling an additional character takes 2 hours, you can use 480 15-second waiting periods (almost 1500 total runs) before you actually lose out on time compared to levelling that 4th character.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Thelgow  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 months ago  (2 children) RNG is RNG. I had 3 characters at 7 get to around 30-40% before I found the 20% movespeed wanderlust boots. that threw off my timing so I made a 4 character. I got first drop around 50% on char#2. then char #4 around 30%, but they were newer. Then around 60% char#1 got it. Char #3 still hasnt.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] maratxtv Kaom [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago  (1 child) Jeez don't make me get started on MS boots.

I was alternating between two characters, a Scion and a Shadow. Both were level 7 60% and the whole process took 6h 42m (/played time). Got two Lifesprigs, a Goldrim and 4 other useless(ish) uniques.

Or can you only fight him once ever without making an alt account or something?  I know he only spawns under certain circumstances, but I've noticed that having other characters fulfill those conditions doesn't seem to cause him to spawn.  Is there an RNG factor or is it just that you only get one shot?        <    >   Showing 1 - 15 of 17 comments               Rikkore    View Profile  View Posts     Dec 21, 2017 @ 9:36pm   what?    #1             The_Driver    View Profile  View Posts     Dec 21, 2017 @ 9:43pm    Originally posted by Rikkore : what?

More interesting to manage?  Also it level scales which makes it nice to run the game with...  And since you can't make the 3rd form of the Goddess anymore since that recipe was disabled.    #7             Zuu Wee Mama    View Profile  View Posts     Dec 22, 2017 @ 3:45am   You can't craft the Goddes Unleash anymore, it is Legacy, which means it is not aviable anymore.

You don't have to do that, although it's probably recommended to do that if you want to get the sword faster. But you can do it with one character only as well, you just have to go to character screen and wait one minute for the instance to reset(it doesn't take 8 to 15 minutes to reset like other instances).    #13             Nuloh    View Profile  View Posts     Mar 4 @ 4:36am   is there a catch to uber hillock im missing killed him 50 times at level 7 he hasnt appeared    #14             URALLPHAGS    View Profile  View Posts     Mar 4 @ 4:47am    Originally posted by Ganiel : Originally posted by niksunorz : Make at least 4 characters and switch to them in order every time you've killed Hillock.

Contents   1  Lore  2  Strategy  3  Uber Hillock  4  Map variants  5  Version History  6  Gallery    Lore    They called him "Hillock". He was born huge: so large that he nearly split his mother in two. Growing up, he was kept from other children, for worries that his freakish size would lead to injury whenever play turned rough. As he grew into a man, his growth continued unabated, and people came from far away to behold him. Fittingly, Hillock found work as a Blacksmith, his massive arms capable of swinging a hammer faster and harder than three men. Hillock was a man of tremendous appetites, the greatest of which was drink. After a day of work, he could often be found surrounded by stacks of mugs, building a stupor to match his strength. He was giant, but mostly harmless, and things might have stayed that way if only that drifter had kept his mouth shut.  It was probably an innocent comment, perhaps made in jest. Whatever the case, Hillock was deep in his cups, and the drifter's words sent the giant man into a drunken rage. His first blow killed the offender, nearly tearing his head from his shoulders, and when his friends rushed to help, they were met with snarling fury. By the end of the melee, the ground was drenched in blood, the floor strewn with mangled, trampled bodies. Hillock staggered back to the smithy to nurse his wounds. No one dared enter to make him answer for his crime, and in the days that followed, people were made uneasy by a ceaseless clanging and scraping that drifted out of the building.  When Hillock finally emerged, he was a changed man. He was silent and humorless, and now he carried with him a gigantic blade, fashioned from his long, frenzied labors in the aftermath of the slaughter. Having tasted murder, Hillock had an appetite for that as well, and he would hack off a man's limbs or head at the slightest ill glance or provocation. Finally, a group of his victims gathered their courage, and in the dead of night, they crept into the smithy, where four of the strongest among them plunged the great sword into Hillock's chest while he slept. Then they carried him far away, and hurled his body down the cliffs into the ocean.  That should have been the end of him, but it wasn't. Some months later, a breathless fisherman returned from seas off the coast of nearby Wraeclast, and reported that he'd seen a hulking, staggering apparition in the surf. Following that sighting, the bodies began to pile up, butchered like cattle, hacked to bloody pieces. In death, Hillock is a far greater terror than he ever was in life. He walks the shores of Wraeclast now, his animated corpse still pierced by the great sword that slew him. He does not feel the icy ocean spray, nor the numerous arrows that now riddle his body. His cold heart is filled with a terrible malice. Any brave enough to put him down for good would surely be met with great reward.   Strategy  Defeating Hillock is easy. Attacking him repeatedly will do, while occasionally drinking a life flask (buttons 1 and 2) to restore health. At around 50% of his life Hillock pulls the sword out of his chest, which will increase his attack speed while also restoring a portion of his life.  Uber Hillock  If the player character is at least level 7, there is a chance for a rare version of Hillock to spawn. The sword on his chest is replaced with an Oni-Goroshi Oni-Goroshi Charan's Sword One Hand Swords Quality: +20% Physical Damage: 6 – 13.2 Critical Strike Chance: (8.50% to 9.50%) Attacks per Second: 1.45 Weapon Range: 9 Requires Level 2 , 9 Str, 9 Dex 40% increased Accuracy Rating Uses both hand slots (70-90)% increased Critical Strike Chance Adds 2 to 3 Physical Damage to Attacks per Level Gain Her Embrace for 3 seconds when you Ignite an Enemy While in Her Embrace, take 0.5% of your total Maximum Life and Energy Shield as Fire Damage per second per Level Item has 6 Sockets and is fully linked (Hidden) "Your name is Demon Slayer?

She said: Every single time, Charan. And still...you'll bathe me, and you'll drink my love. Until you can't. , which drops on death. He has more life and damage and can do a Leap Slam that summons zombies, like his map boss counterparts. Because the Twilight Strand becomes inaccessible when the character enters Lioneye's Watch after killing Hillock, obtaining Oni-Goroshi from Hillock requires the following, somewhat "grindy" procedure:  With a new character, kill Hillock and optionally every other monster in the Twilight Strand.  Do not enter Lioneye's Watch but log out to the character selection screen, wait about 1 minute 30 seconds for the instance to reset (the Twilight Strand has a shorter reset period than other zones), and reenter the game with the same character. This puts the character back at the beginning of the Twilight Strand.  Continue killing Hillock and then log out until reaching level 7, at which point Oni-Goroshi may drop from Hillock.  To speed up this procedure, a batch of three or four new characters can be used in serial to farm Hillock in this manner (each Hillock kill takes about 30 seconds with +10% movement speed boots). Considering that reaching level 7 requires 19 324 experience points, and that experience gains from the level 1 monsters diminish with rising character level, this requires around 2 hours of playtime per character to reach level 7 if most monsters are killed each Twilight Strand run. Furthermore, using Scion will allow you to take movement speed nodes on the bottom right of the tree, hence allowing you to gain experience at a faster rate.

Contents   1  Lore  2  Strategy  3  Uber Hillock  4  Map variants  5  Version History  6  Gallery    Lore    They called him "Hillock". He was born huge: so large that he nearly split his mother in two. Growing up, he was kept from other children, for worries that his freakish size would lead to injury whenever play turned rough. As he grew into a man, his growth continued unabated, and people came from far away to behold him. Fittingly, Hillock found work as a Blacksmith, his massive arms capable of swinging a hammer faster and harder than three men. Hillock was a man of tremendous appetites, the greatest of which was drink. After a day of work, he could often be found surrounded by stacks of mugs, building a stupor to match his strength. He was giant, but mostly harmless, and things might have stayed that way if only that drifter had kept his mouth shut.  It was probably an innocent comment, perhaps made in jest. Whatever the case, Hillock was deep in his cups, and the drifter's words sent the giant man into a drunken rage. His first blow killed the offender, nearly tearing his head from his shoulders, and when his friends rushed to help, they were met with snarling fury. By the end of the melee, the ground was drenched in blood, the floor strewn with mangled, trampled bodies. Hillock staggered back to the smithy to nurse his wounds. No one dared enter to make him answer for his crime, and in the days that followed, people were made uneasy by a ceaseless clanging and scraping that drifted out of the building.  When Hillock finally emerged, he was a changed man. He was silent and humorless, and now he carried with him a gigantic blade, fashioned from his long, frenzied labors in the aftermath of the slaughter. Having tasted murder, Hillock had an appetite for that as well, and he would hack off a man's limbs or head at the slightest ill glance or provocation. Finally, a group of his victims gathered their courage, and in the dead of night, they crept into the smithy, where four of the strongest among them plunged the great sword into Hillock's chest while he slept. Then they carried him far away, and hurled his body down the cliffs into the ocean.  That should have been the end of him, but it wasn't. Some months later, a breathless fisherman returned from seas off the coast of nearby Wraeclast, and reported that he'd seen a hulking, staggering apparition in the surf. Following that sighting, the bodies began to pile up, butchered like cattle, hacked to bloody pieces. In death, Hillock is a far greater terror than he ever was in life. He walks the shores of Wraeclast now, his animated corpse still pierced by the great sword that slew him. He does not feel the icy ocean spray, nor the numerous arrows that now riddle his body. His cold heart is filled with a terrible malice. Any brave enough to put him down for good would surely be met with great reward.   Strategy  Defeating Hillock is easy. Attacking him repeatedly will do, while occasionally drinking a life flask (buttons 1 and 2) to restore health. At around 50% of his life Hillock pulls the sword out of his chest, which will increase his attack speed while also restoring a portion of his life.  Uber Hillock  If the player character is at least level 7, there is a chance for a rare version of Hillock to spawn. The sword on his chest is replaced with an Oni-Goroshi Oni-Goroshi Charan's Sword One Hand Swords Quality: +20% Physical Damage: 6 – 13.2 Critical Strike Chance: (8.50% to 9.50%) Attacks per Second: 1.45 Weapon Range: 9 Requires Level 2 , 9 Str, 9 Dex 40% increased Accuracy Rating Uses both hand slots (70-90)% increased Critical Strike Chance Adds 2 to 3 Physical Damage to Attacks per Level Gain Her Embrace for 3 seconds when you Ignite an Enemy While in Her Embrace, take 0.5% of your total Maximum Life and Energy Shield as Fire Damage per second per Level Item has 6 Sockets and is fully linked (Hidden) "Your name is Demon Slayer? Really? Good name for rotgut, that." She said: I prefer "The Goddess Of Swords". Much more dignified. And accurate. "Demon Slayer The Cheap And Nasty it is then. Burns going down, burns coming up?" She said: Every single time, Charan. And still...you'll bathe me, and you'll drink my love. Until you can't. , which drops on death. He has more life and damage and can do a Leap Slam that summons zombies, like his map boss counterparts. Because the Twilight Strand becomes inaccessible when the character enters Lioneye's Watch after killing Hillock, obtaining Oni-Goroshi from Hillock requires the following, somewhat "grindy" procedure:  With a new character, kill Hillock and optionally every other monster in the Twilight Strand.  Do not enter Lioneye's Watch but log out to the character selection screen, wait about 1 minute 30 seconds for the instance to reset (the Twilight Strand has a shorter reset period than other zones), and reenter the game with the same character. This puts the character back at the beginning of the Twilight Strand.  Continue killing Hillock and then log out until reaching level 7, at which point Oni-Goroshi may drop from Hillock.  To speed up this procedure, a batch of three or four new characters can be used in serial to farm Hillock in this manner (each Hillock kill takes about 30 seconds with +10% movement speed boots). Considering that reaching level 7 requires 19 324 experience points, and that experience gains from the level 1 monsters diminish with rising character level, this requires around 2 hours of playtime per character to reach level 7 if most monsters are killed each Twilight Strand run. Furthermore, using Scion will allow you to take movement speed nodes on the bottom right of the tree, hence allowing you to gain experience at a faster rate.  Map variants  Stronger versions of Hillock serve as map bosses:    Map  Level  Name  Notes    Dunes Map Dunes Map Map Level: 74 Map Tier: 7 Guild Character : A Travel to this Map by using it in the Templar Laboratory or a personal Map Device. Maps can only be used once.  74  The Blacksmith  Leap Slam Spawns Unstable Aberrations  Version History    Version  Changes    3.2.0    The Oni-Goroshi version of Hillock has more life, deals more damage, and has learned a new trick.     1.3.0c    Fixed a bug where there could be a short clientside freeze when Hillock was killed.     1.1.3    Removed the invulnerability period from Hillock when he is drawing his sword in all difficulties.     1.0.6    Hillock now uses the same triggered effect that the Blacksmith does, in Cruel and Merciless difficulties. The damage of the poison cloud produced by his zombies has been reduced in all instances (including Maps).

Made the error of not picking a Scion for this as they get early access to movement nodes. I had thought rogue worked for + movement, but not really seeing it based on getting to level 7. I had a unique claw drop though.      1                    Posted Sat Jan 13, 2018 9:38 pm     QuickReply    QuickQuote    Reply    Quote             [+] Dice rolls                          Front Page | Welcome | Contact | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | Advertise | Support BGG | Feeds   Geekdo, BoardGameGeek, the Geekdo logo, and the BoardGameGeek logo are trademarks of BoardGameGeek, LLC.                                   we're hiring!  blog  about imgur  imgur store  imgur apps  developer api  advertise  need help?      terms  privacy  ad choices           Upload Images  Video to GIF  Make a Meme      New post                  sign in    sign up                   Possible League first Oni-Goroshi?

A) Are you waiting the 1:30 or whatever to allow the instance to reset? B) I wouldn't be shocked at all if they nerfed the spawn rate      Download x64 PoEHUD ( DirectX 11 in PoE's settings)  Download x86 PoEHUD ( DirectX 9 in PoE's settings) (Not currently working in 3.2.0) Areas with corrupted side zones change the area title color. You can change this to a preload in the preload menu.

That's why I always kill the first zombie to make sure every time I log back onto the character it is a fresh instance if the zombie isn't dead. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, I'll keep trying and update back here later!

Just always remember to wait 90secs (I was using a timer for that).  About the preload, if you have the last update from poeHUD, should work, just make sure when you click in the settins ( "=") the option preload alert is on (not red).

Reddit figured it out.       As the title says I've found an exploit and would prefer to speak with GGG's staff privately rather than file a public report.  Edit: Cat's out of the bag, reddit figured it out.  Uber Hillock spawns independent of the state of the zone, e.g. you don't need to reset the zone.  If you clear the zone to normal Hillock and kill him and type /remaining to check how many enemies are present you have a guidepost.  Logging and typing /remaining will spoil if Uber Hillock has spawned.  This is repeatable on one character and Uber Hillock can keep spawning.  It shortens the farm from 30-40 seconds with a 90 second cooldown to 2 seconds each time if you're slow.  This would certainly seem to be an exploit.  Edit2: I realized too late I shouldn't sell the two Onis I got this way and sold them for 50c and 1ex (with 30c change) in ASC.  This currency will remain untouched if GGG wants to destroy it.

It also depends on how they feel about it being exploited, they might be OK for you to get one as you still need to do the levelling to even get the spawn to happen, but people that are spamming it and getting multiple oni's are digging their own grave.

Because in this particular NEW & SPECIFIC case (spawn event) - we can't be sure that it's an exploit.  Why? Thanks to GGG's love of information being obscured as much as possible. -_- This backfires at them AGAIN. "Figure out how to farm Oni-Goroshi by yourself, guys. If you'd be grave wrong - we'll ban you" How about no?  GGG might have missed some stuff in their coding for Uber Hillock event - but that doesn't give them rights to insta-ban people who found it and (even) reported.  USUALLY, company should fix this "exploit" and apologize for the inconvenience. Or AT LEAST post PSA.  Remember, suffering is convenient. That is why many people prefer it.

Uhh might be the wrong thread but  Is Oni Goroshi even real ?  Suspicious because the name of the base is Charan's sword  Its drops from "Uber Hilock" - This has got to be a Joke , I meant right?? IS this like a early April's fool leak ?  I am almost level 8 and haven't seen uber hillock spawn, got 4 uniques in the mean time farming strand.. From the videos and reddit post I was under the impression that Uber hillock spawns right after you hit level 7 , may be my interpretation was incorrect.  I was under the impression that this would be an eazy leveling sword to get , so I abandoned levilign my lv 20 marauder so I cound get this sword and use it. But it seems like Charan's Uniques always have a string or a catch attached to the item, Like The goddess unleashed. You had to do so much stuff to get a pretty useless sword ( a part from good 3d art)  Now this new sword has the same art!! So its even more suspicious.  Is Charan just some rich guy trying to troll all the poe players ?  Must be rich to spend so much money just to troll players, I don't understand how GGG can allow this.  Thanks for supporting the game but I wonder how much of it is legitimately to support GGG and how much of it is to grief and troll people..

Definitely not a troll or april fools joke.    It's pretty far from useless too.  It has the same art as The Goddess Unleashed because it's a direct replacement. Unleashed had dialog only for 4 acts, when GGG added 6 more acts Charan had the sword redone. Unleashed can no longer be crafted.  Pretty damn fun to level with too. :)  Just keep grinding for it, you'll eventually get it.  "May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house."  On hiatus for the next 3 months or so.

Ialso didn't know the goddess unleashed is unobtainable now. interesting.  but I want to make it clear to everyone trying to get it that it not worth farming.  Probably more easier to hit high levels and just buy it for currency from botters  but then whats the point because this sword  looks like a league starter item..so much controversy .

I got it by killing Hillock over and over and over. Level 7 seems to be when the drop rate of it raises significantly, I am unaware of anyone dropping it before hitting lvl 7. Many people have hit lvl 8 and not dropped it yet. I have 3 more in rotation, 2 are almost lvl 8 and the other is just approaching lvl 6. Keep grinding when you feel up to it or save up some chaos and buy one. It's been super fun leveling with it so far.  Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.

( self.pathofexile ) submitted 3 months ago by maratxtv Kaom Well yesterday I got my goroshi shortly after hitting 7. Today I made two new characters for fun, got them to 7, and no uber hillock after hours.  I have a strict timer, and swap on reset. Not much time wasted.  Is there a lower chance to get a goroshi on your second char? Am I just hitting a streak of bad luck, as most people I know that got multiples consider the drop itself common; the longest part (I agree) is 6-7.  Any thoughts? thanks!   16 comments share save hide report all 16 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment!

TIA   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] maratxtv Kaom [ S ]  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 months ago  (5 children) Scion, rush the 3 movement speed nodes ( www.poeurl.com/bHPr ) this is you at level 5. After you can get the notable that comes after, and then the projectile damage node. Really all that matters is the MS.  Do not wear any body armor or a shield, they slow you down. Boots, Gloves, and Hats are OK.  Duel wield fast weapons, as you kill everything in one hit.  Most important item will be movespeed boots. ID all boots, use all your alchs and augs a swell.  You will also want a rustic sash + iron rings. Even white ones are good enough.  With this setup you'll be killing everything ezpz.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] DU66IE  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 months ago  (4 children) Thank you very much   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] maratxtv Kaom [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 months ago  (3 children) Anytime.

By my calculations, after three runs are over, you only have 10-15 seconds of waiting until the first is refreshed again.  If levelling an additional character takes 2 hours, you can use 480 15-second waiting periods (almost 1500 total runs) before you actually lose out on time compared to levelling that 4th character.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Thelgow  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 months ago  (2 children) RNG is RNG. I had 3 characters at 7 get to around 30-40% before I found the 20% movespeed wanderlust boots. that threw off my timing so I made a 4 character. I got first drop around 50% on char#2. then char #4 around 30%, but they were newer. Then around 60% char#1 got it. Char #3 still hasnt.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] maratxtv Kaom [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago  (1 child) Jeez don't make me get started on MS boots.

I was alternating between two characters, a Scion and a Shadow. Both were level 7 60% and the whole process took 6h 42m (/played time). Got two Lifesprigs, a Goldrim and 4 other useless(ish) uniques.

Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet. Become a Redditor and subscribe to one of thousands of communities. × 147 148 149 Guide Guide to farming Uber Hillock [SC]  ( self.pathofexile ) submitted 1 month ago  * by Deadscale Howdy, during the downtime between my runs I figured I'd knock up a guide for people farming Uber Hillock as when I started farming it last week I hadn't seen much info about it outside of "Pick Scion for Movement Speed" and "Hit level 7, then rush Hillock". A lot of whats in here is pretty obvious stuff if you've been playing the game for any decent amount of time, but as someone who doesn't know much, my first attempt at farming this was pretty pitiful and took way longer then I expected, so I looked around, tried some stuff and settled on this.  The Guide is made with softcore in mind using the Scion, I've killed the new Uber hillock without dying at all but my character was level 8, had some pretty good gear and he still took half my max hp when he slammed, so things may overlap but I can't promise your safety in HC with the items I'm recommending as I forgo most armour pieces etc.  Up to now I've farmed two swords, one before the patch, one after, I'm probably gonna finish farming another one and that'll be my lot.   TL:DR  Class : Scion  Passives : https://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/3.2.0/AAAABAAAACMxOyhMMolr7HQ=  Gear in order of priority:  1) Movement Speed on Boots  2) Strong Weapon that works with ST,
Generally this will be a Two handed Corroded blade/Driftwood Maul, but a god-like rusted hatchet is probably your best bet if you manage to find one. Two good one-handed weapons are going to be your best bet if you can find them  3) An item with 2 green sockets linked, preferably not a shield or body armour.  4) Iron Rings/Rustic Sash.  5) HP / Mana pots.  Try not to use anything that reduces your movement speed such as body armour of shields   Uber Hillock Farming  If you're totally new to Uber Hillock farming, the pre-requesits to get Uber Hillock to spawn and to get the Oni-Goroshi is that you must be on a character that hasn't gotten the sword drop before and you mustn't have (not confirmed) left the Twilight Strand (you can't go to town and come back). This means after killing hillock at the end of the map, you log out/exit to the character select screen and wait for the map to reset.  It takes around 2~ minutes (just under) for the map to reset, because of this it's useful to have multiple characters so you can swap between them and keep farming while the others are resetting, the minimum you can get away with is 3 characters, but if you get lucky on all 3 characters with the right items you may finish the map on the final character before the first one has reset, so having a 4th character is recommended but not required if you're a tad lazy.  He looks similar to normal hillock, but the sword sticking out of his chest will be different (it's an oni-goroshi) and he'll have a ton more HP, so you should know pretty quickly if you're fighting him.  Also before the patch you had to hit level 7 for him to start appearing, but apparently this was changed with the recent patch, Slipperyjim8 found an Oni-goroshi as a level 6 shadow, so for the time being I'm going to say you've gotta atleast be level 6, note that i personally got my swords at level 7 and the second at half way through level 8, so mileage may vary.   The Build  Scion is the class of choice if you're farming uber hillock, Her passive tree has movement speed near the start which already puts her ahead of everyone else, she has Spectral Throw which is great for clearing, does decent damage and can deal with his new move pretty easily, ontop of that you also get the Onslaught support gem to link, giving you more movement speed, she's perfect for this.  Passive wise you'll want something like this , the movement speed nodes are really the only thing you need when farming Uber Hillock.  After that pick up the notable after the movement speed nodes and then go for projectile damage.   Gear  In terms of gear, there's only a couple of things you really want when it comes to farming uber hillock, Movement Speed and Damage.  So in order of Priority  1) Movement Speed on Boots
This is the most important piece of gear, This + Onslaught + Your Passives nets you 39% movement speed which makes fishing for Hillock really fast.  2) Strong Weapon that works with ST
Something that attacks fast, works with your skill and one-shots zombies is what you're looking for. Ideally you want a godly rusted hatchet, but I tend to find that I'm never lucky with that and end up using a rare Corroded Blade/Driftwood Maul which does the job just fine. If you do manage to find yourself two decent one handed weapons, they're going to be your best bet.  3) An item with 2 green sockets linked, preferably not a shield or body armour.
Finding a decent one of these is a pain in the ass, you don't want to be wearing body armour or a shield as it slows you down, so what you're hoping for is a pair of gloves/helmet or get lucky and have your weapon/boots have 2 green sockets that are linked.  4) Iron Rings/Rustic Sash.
After you've gotten the three main things, the only thing left is to boost your damage as much as you can, Iron rings, Rustic Sash, anything you can find that boosts your damage.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is Path of Exile, these are only recommendations and you're going to need some luck to find all of these in the first place, My first Oni-Goroshi farmer that's still farming (level 8 and a half) has only just found a pair of movement speed boots, and I got them by using an Alch i found on the floor on a pair of boots (I'm in standard so while I wouldn't recommend using an Alch in league, I don't mind burning it in standard as I have a fair amount).   Leveling  Leveling is quite a tedious process when it comes down to it, Approach it as you would leveling anywhere else, try to clear the map as much as possible but don't backtrack, the second you kill Hillock and loot any useful items exit and swap to a different character, rinse-repeat this till you've gotten the items you need or are level 6, don't forget the zombie that has your skill gem at the start of the level, this extra zombie kill each time will add up over the course of the run.  To start try to get a strong weapon, it doesn't have to be rare or one handed (although using spectral throw is required, so no bows) just aslong as it'll one-shot the zombies in one throw. I tend to find it easier to use Corroded blades/Driftwood mauls early on if i don't get a good rare Rusted Hatched. Unless you get a good rare One hander I wouldn't bother with them.  look in most of the corpses/chests that you find, while you may not find a good weapon in them I tend to find most of my Wisdom Scrolls/Green Socketed items/Transmutes in them.  If you happen to get a shield with two Green slots and nothing else, pick up an extra weapon (doesn't matter what) and put it as your weapon swap. If you don't manage to find another item with 2 greens linked slots hopefully you've found a decent 1 handed weapon you can use later to proc onslaught then weapon swap so you don't lose movespeed.  Prioritize using your wisdom scrolls on Boots and a Strong weapon. Don't just ID random Rare items like amulets/chests/helmets etc as you'll quickly run out of Wisdom Scrolls doing that, the boots really speed up the entire process.  Ideally your first Hillock will net you a good enough weapon to let you farm at a decent pace and focus on boots, but use your best judgement. If by level 6 you still haven't found any movement speed boots, but are sitting on 10 scrolls with 2 rare Iron rings in your inventory, you may aswell use a couple on them.  Pick up pretty much every pair of boots you find, even normal ones and just use all the transmutes you find on them to try and get movespeed, after that you can save your transmutes if you want.  Once you've found your Movement speed boots + Strong weapon, try to find Iron Rings/Rustic Sash and an item with 2 Green sockets that are linked that Isn't a shield/chest piece, don't bother wearing any body armour or shields as it'll just slow you down, only use them if you don't have another single green socket to use.  Picking up Mana / Life pots is a decent idea also, try to just keep your belt full of potions incase you need them (mana usually more then health).  Ideally you'd want to finish up with Two Iron Rings, a Rustic Sash, Boots with Movespeed, and a Strong weapon.   Farming  Once you've gotten all your gear and have hit level 6 you're basically set, all you have to do now is spawn in on each of your characters, run to hillock while killing to Proc your onslaught on the way, kill him when you get there and swap characters if it wasn't uber hillock. Generally speaking you can get away with leaving as soon as you see it's not Uber Hillock (look at the sword) but as most of us farm while watching something on the side, I tend to just kill him anyway as I'm not paying attention and you'll find out real quick if it's uber or not.  If you're at the farming phase but haven't gotten a decent weapon or movespeed boots, on the way to hillock try and grab the corpses/barrels and check his drops when you kill him and pray to RNGesus that you find some.  Other then that, put some tunes/a show on, and just farm away.   Uber Hillock  When you finally find the big guy you then have to kill him, his first phase is pretty easy as he's just got a lot of health, depending on your weapon this'll take a couple seconds or a couple minutes, you're not really at risk of dying to this phase as long as you kite him.  When he pulls the sword out of his chest and goes super saiyan that's when shit starts to get real, He has a leap slam attack which does a fair chunk of your health (or outright kills you depending on your gear/level) and he'll start to spawn zombies. The zombies are quite useful for this fight as you'll most likely one hit them and it'll give you onslaught making you kill him faster, but try not to let them build up or they'll overwhelm you.  It's just a case of dodging/healing through his leap slams and killing the zombies while dealing damage to him, kill him and your quest is complete, pick up the sword and either listen to the text that follows picking it up, rush into town fast before the servers go down and you lose your drop.   End  Hopefully this helped some of you out who are trying to farm Uber Hillock, as i said initially a lot of this stuff is common knowledge, but back when I was looking for some info around farming Uber Hillock I never found much outside of a few youtube guides basically all saying "Get movespeed boots and make four characters".   102 comments share save hide report all 102 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

I don’t even know what to do with it...  I’m a noob...  but I decided at 11:00 PM last night to do it while watching TV.  At around hour three, I was starting to realize how daunting it is to get to level 7!  Damn.  Took me four hours to get my four scions to level 5.  Took an additional 1.5 hours to get them to level 7.  At level 7 I started going right to Hillock, which really sped up farming.  30 seconds per run or so...  After only 30 minutes at level 7, I ran into Uber.   Rolled an almost perfect Oni, too.  EDIT:  88% of a possible 70-90 crit!  Good luck to anyone who tries.

I didn’t do full clears, wasting steps.  I only killed on the way to hillock.   Then, at level 7 it’s a straight run to Hillock.  Dual wielding helps with DPS.  Make sure to switch.  Don’t worry about a dual link green for onslaught either.

no drop. even if i get drop any soon not worth it to waste of 1 day. total buzzkiller of league start. just dont do it   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Deadscale [ S ]  24 points 25 points 26 points  1 month ago  (8 children) That's what they were going for with this update, they don't want it to be a staple that anyone can get in a couple of hours farming.  IMO I'd only suggest going for the Oni if your build demands it, i don't think it's a good idea as a league starter and, especially for people like me who hate leveling multiple characters, unless you absolutely need it for your build to work, don't bother with it.  This is just to help out those people who do want to farm it, Personally I'm skipping this league and just playing standard, but I've farmed one so far and it's only taken a day, as stated Mileage may vary, but it's possible.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] sadful  5 points 6 points 7 points  1 month ago  (6 children) yeah its selling for 70c and since they normalized the droprate so that 12+ hours of farming means you'll only prob see one every 12 hours. definitely absolutely not worth farming for whether you want to sell or use. There is no build that this is mandatory for so thats out the window.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Deadscale [ S ]  6 points 7 points 8 points  1 month ago  (0 children)  yeah its selling for 70c and since they normalized the droprate so that 12+ hours of farming means you'll only prob see one every 12 hours.   Not sure bout how many hours per oni, i'm not recommending that you farm this for currency or anything, as i said i'd only recommend it if your build calls for it and you can't afford it.   There is no build that this is mandatory for so thats out the window.   I mean that depends on if the guy who's playing the character wants it for their build doesn't it? if you Really want an Oni for your build, and you Really want to level with it, then go for the farm I say.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] ErgeesS  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 month ago  (4 children) You'll make tons more currency just mapping with a fast build.

If they think the item is "broken" then just don't add it in the first place or remove instead of make it become impossible to archive.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] zeronic  11 points 12 points 13 points  1 month ago  (0 children) Not gonna lie, i really don't think the goroshi problem is as big as  ggg makes it out to be. The acquisition method is so obtuse you need to learn it externally to even know it exists, and then you need to painstakingly farm it.  Even pre-nerf farming oni made me wanna just quit and go do something more productive with my life, i can't imagine what it is now. The vast majority of players probably are with me in that oni farming was soul crushingly boring and would rather do actual fun things, then buy it.  The majority of the playerbase probably doesn't even know it exists to begin with, so for those new players it doesn't really even trivialize the leveling process anyways since most players in general don't seem to trade at all(at least per old ggg posts.)   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Scarbrow free bitch no gaming  4 points 5 points 6 points  1 month ago *  (10 children) Because the supporter who made it paid multiple thousands of dollars to have a 6-link sword usable throughout the entire leveling and endgame in addition to having it drop specifically from Hillock - with specific voice lines for milestones as you level. The combination of Charan and GGG wanted it to be appropriately strong and feel 'legendary' and I guess they felt it was too consistent to farm in the simple 3-4 hours it took last patch.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] lifecereals  2 points 3 points 4 points  1 month ago  (0 children) He just wanted his item to feel more special. He didn't like that everyone was able to get it so easy. I feel like someone dedicating 5+ hours to farming twlight strand should be enough to get the special sword, especially after they nerfed the way you could clear the map and just zone in over and over every second until it spawned.  A realistic nerf would have been to make it where you could only get one per character.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] xy1k  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 month ago  (7 children) maybe they need to change farm method. caz of grinding 15 hour twilight strand is bullshit.

I've got this in the guide already under Leveling, still a good suggestion.  That being said I personally don't rate shadows for this type of farm.  Shadows certainly have the higher DPS, but that only matters for the Uber Hillock fight as you still one shot zombies with Spectral Throw.  So you're trading lower damage in the hillock fight for 39% movespeed with onslaught on, 19% movespeed unbuffed. seems way faster as a scion.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Xukfu Scion  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 month ago *  (0 children) I'm at 11 hours without a drop. 4 Level 7 rotation.

I feel the increased attack speed helps speed up moving through the map as you level to 7, since you're going to be one-shotting the zombies anyway. Plus, it seems Corroded Blades are a lot more rare.  Edit: All 4 of my chars have about 55dps Tooltip DPS with 2x rare Rusted Spikes, every rare Corroded Blade drops my Tooltip down to ~33dps, or less. I think the DW bonus plays a more significant role than you might think.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Deadscale [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 month ago *  (1 child) It's not that it doesn't play a role, it's more-so that I've never found two decent one handed weapons when I've ran it.  I consistently see Driftwood Mauls/Corroded blades dropping for the most part and they tend to have decent modifiers, only One of my characters got two decent one handed drops which I then used instead of my Two hander, If i get a good one-handed rusted hatchet drop i tend to use that to clear the map and I'll go back and put in the guide that if you find two god-like onehanders it's probably better, but in all of my characters so far I've only gotten that once, and i was level 8 by the time I did find them.  EDIT: For some context, My current three characters (one who found the sword) all have a decent driftwood maul with some combination of added physical, added elemental and increased physical (One of them has increased phys, added fire and added lightning). One of these is half way to level 8 too, and one of them has two decent Rusted Hatchets and the off-hand one isn't all that good (all it has is added 2-3 fire damage). In my case i almost never see any decent one handers.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] twiz__ 12 Hours farming Oni-Goroshi, and all I got was a Shabby Jerkin  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 month ago  (0 children)  In my case i almost never see any decent one handers.

Im confused   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Deadscale [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  25 days ago  (1 child) Check this section   This means after killing hillock at the end of the map, you log out/exit to the character select screen and wait for the map to reset.  It takes around 2~ minutes (just under) for the map to reset, because of this it's useful to have multiple characters so you can swap between them and keep farming while the others are resetting, the minimum you can get away with is 3 characters, but if you get lucky on all 3 characters with the right items you may finish the map on the final character before the first one has reset, so having a 4th character is recommended but not required if you're a tad lazy.   You basically spawn, kill the low level monsters on your way to hillock, kill hillock and then swap characters, rinse and repeat for 12+ hours.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] sxssvns  0 points 1 point 2 points  25 days ago *  (0 children) Oh fuck that.

The only thing I did right was id some boots which gave me some movement speed.  "You have died 50 times". 0 deaths till Uber Hillock.  My most powerful character in Abyss at level 90 had 72 deaths by comparison.  Getting a decent weapon is critical b/c without it you get wrecked. Hillock summons minions to help him and those minions take 2-3 hits to die if you have a lousy weapon like me even if you're dual wielding and using Viper Strike.  Fun fact: those minions crowd you like crazy so you literally may not be able to touch Hillock consistently once he starts summoning help. For all intents and purposes, you may as well pretend you're using a single target skill without any secondary effects or melee splash.  Be sure to get a decent weapon. Dying over and over again and praying to god you actually get close enough to touch Hillock is not a fun experience.  Good luck anyone else farming Hillock.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] slylycan  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 month ago  (1 child) Out of curiosity what level were you?   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Dolandlod  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 month ago  (0 children) 7.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Or can you only fight him once ever without making an alt account or something?  I know he only spawns under certain circumstances, but I've noticed that having other characters fulfill those conditions doesn't seem to cause him to spawn.

Contents   1  Lore  2  Strategy  3  Uber Hillock  4  Map variants  5  Version History  6  Gallery    Lore    They called him "Hillock". He was born huge: so large that he nearly split his mother in two. Growing up, he was kept from other children, for worries that his freakish size would lead to injury whenever play turned rough. As he grew into a man, his growth continued unabated, and people came from far away to behold him. Fittingly, Hillock found work as a Blacksmith, his massive arms capable of swinging a hammer faster and harder than three men. Hillock was a man of tremendous appetites, the greatest of which was drink. After a day of work, he could often be found surrounded by stacks of mugs, building a stupor to match his strength. He was giant, but mostly harmless, and things might have stayed that way if only that drifter had kept his mouth shut.  It was probably an innocent comment, perhaps made in jest. Whatever the case, Hillock was deep in his cups, and the drifter's words sent the giant man into a drunken rage. His first blow killed the offender, nearly tearing his head from his shoulders, and when his friends rushed to help, they were met with snarling fury. By the end of the melee, the ground was drenched in blood, the floor strewn with mangled, trampled bodies. Hillock staggered back to the smithy to nurse his wounds. No one dared enter to make him answer for his crime, and in the days that followed, people were made uneasy by a ceaseless clanging and scraping that drifted out of the building.  When Hillock finally emerged, he was a changed man. He was silent and humorless, and now he carried with him a gigantic blade, fashioned from his long, frenzied labors in the aftermath of the slaughter. Having tasted murder, Hillock had an appetite for that as well, and he would hack off a man's limbs or head at the slightest ill glance or provocation. Finally, a group of his victims gathered their courage, and in the dead of night, they crept into the smithy, where four of the strongest among them plunged the great sword into Hillock's chest while he slept. Then they carried him far away, and hurled his body down the cliffs into the ocean.  That should have been the end of him, but it wasn't. Some months later, a breathless fisherman returned from seas off the coast of nearby Wraeclast, and reported that he'd seen a hulking, staggering apparition in the surf. Following that sighting, the bodies began to pile up, butchered like cattle, hacked to bloody pieces. In death, Hillock is a far greater terror than he ever was in life. He walks the shores of Wraeclast now, his animated corpse still pierced by the great sword that slew him. He does not feel the icy ocean spray, nor the numerous arrows that now riddle his body. His cold heart is filled with a terrible malice. Any brave enough to put him down for good would surely be met with great reward.   Strategy  Defeating Hillock is easy. Attacking him repeatedly will do, while occasionally drinking a life flask (buttons 1 and 2) to restore health. At around 50% of his life Hillock pulls the sword out of his chest, which will increase his attack speed while also restoring a portion of his life.  Uber Hillock  If the player character is at least level 7, there is a chance for a rare version of Hillock to spawn. The sword on his chest is replaced with an Oni-Goroshi Oni-Goroshi Charan's Sword One Hand Swords Quality: +20% Physical Damage: 6 – 13.2 Critical Strike Chance: (8.50% to 9.50%) Attacks per Second: 1.45 Weapon Range: 9 Requires Level 2 , 9 Str, 9 Dex 40% increased Accuracy Rating Uses both hand slots (70-90)% increased Critical Strike Chance Adds 2 to 3 Physical Damage to Attacks per Level Gain Her Embrace for 3 seconds when you Ignite an Enemy While in Her Embrace, take 0.5% of your total Maximum Life and Energy Shield as Fire Damage per second per Level Item has 6 Sockets and is fully linked (Hidden) "Your name is Demon Slayer?

He has more life and damage and can do a Leap Slam that summons zombies, like his map boss counterparts. Because the Twilight Strand becomes inaccessible when the character enters Lioneye's Watch after killing Hillock, obtaining Oni-Goroshi from Hillock requires the following, somewhat "grindy" procedure:  With a new character, kill Hillock and optionally every other monster in the Twilight Strand.  Do not enter Lioneye's Watch but log out to the character selection screen, wait about 1 minute 30 seconds for the instance to reset (the Twilight Strand has a shorter reset period than other zones), and reenter the game with the same character. This puts the character back at the beginning of the Twilight Strand.  Continue killing Hillock and then log out until reaching level 7, at which point Oni-Goroshi may drop from Hillock.  To speed up this procedure, a batch of three or four new characters can be used in serial to farm Hillock in this manner (each Hillock kill takes about 30 seconds with +10% movement speed boots). Considering that reaching level 7 requires 19 324 experience points, and that experience gains from the level 1 monsters diminish with rising character level, this requires around 2 hours of playtime per character to reach level 7 if most monsters are killed each Twilight Strand run. Furthermore, using Scion will allow you to take movement speed nodes on the bottom right of the tree, hence allowing you to gain experience at a faster rate.

Hillock was a man of tremendous appetites, the greatest of which was drink. After a day of work, he could often be found surrounded by stacks of mugs, building a stupor to match his strength. He was giant, but mostly harmless, and things might have stayed that way if only that drifter had kept his mouth shut.  It was probably an innocent comment, perhaps made in jest. Whatever the case, Hillock was deep in his cups, and the drifter's words sent the giant man into a drunken rage. His first blow killed the offender, nearly tearing his head from his shoulders, and when his friends rushed to help, they were met with snarling fury. By the end of the melee, the ground was drenched in blood, the floor strewn with mangled, trampled bodies. Hillock staggered back to the smithy to nurse his wounds. No one dared enter to make him answer for his crime, and in the days that followed, people were made uneasy by a ceaseless clanging and scraping that drifted out of the building.  When Hillock finally emerged, he was a changed man. He was silent and humorless, and now he carried with him a gigantic blade, fashioned from his long, frenzied labors in the aftermath of the slaughter. Having tasted murder, Hillock had an appetite for that as well, and he would hack off a man's limbs or head at the slightest ill glance or provocation. Finally, a group of his victims gathered their courage, and in the dead of night, they crept into the smithy, where four of the strongest among them plunged the great sword into Hillock's chest while he slept. Then they carried him far away, and hurled his body down the cliffs into the ocean.  That should have been the end of him, but it wasn't. Some months later, a breathless fisherman returned from seas off the coast of nearby Wraeclast, and reported that he'd seen a hulking, staggering apparition in the surf. Following that sighting, the bodies began to pile up, butchered like cattle, hacked to bloody pieces. In death, Hillock is a far greater terror than he ever was in life. He walks the shores of Wraeclast now, his animated corpse still pierced by the great sword that slew him. He does not feel the icy ocean spray, nor the numerous arrows that now riddle his body. His cold heart is filled with a terrible malice. Any brave enough to put him down for good would surely be met with great reward.   Strategy  Defeating Hillock is easy. Attacking him repeatedly will do, while occasionally drinking a life flask (buttons 1 and 2) to restore health. At around 50% of his life Hillock pulls the sword out of his chest, which will increase his attack speed while also restoring a portion of his life.  Uber Hillock  If the player character is at least level 7, there is a chance for a rare version of Hillock to spawn. The sword on his chest is replaced with an Oni-Goroshi Oni-Goroshi Charan's Sword One Hand Swords Quality: +20% Physical Damage: 6 – 13.2 Critical Strike Chance: (8.50% to 9.50%) Attacks per Second: 1.45 Weapon Range: 9 Requires Level 2 , 9 Str, 9 Dex 40% increased Accuracy Rating Uses both hand slots (70-90)% increased Critical Strike Chance Adds 2 to 3 Physical Damage to Attacks per Level Gain Her Embrace for 3 seconds when you Ignite an Enemy While in Her Embrace, take 0.5% of your total Maximum Life and Energy Shield as Fire Damage per second per Level Item has 6 Sockets and is fully linked (Hidden) "Your name is Demon Slayer? Really? Good name for rotgut, that." She said: I prefer "The Goddess Of Swords". Much more dignified. And accurate. "Demon Slayer The Cheap And Nasty it is then. Burns going down, burns coming up?" She said: Every single time, Charan. And still...you'll bathe me, and you'll drink my love. Until you can't. , which drops on death. He has more life and damage and can do a Leap Slam that summons zombies, like his map boss counterparts. Because the Twilight Strand becomes inaccessible when the character enters Lioneye's Watch after killing Hillock, obtaining Oni-Goroshi from Hillock requires the following, somewhat "grindy" procedure:  With a new character, kill Hillock and optionally every other monster in the Twilight Strand.  Do not enter Lioneye's Watch but log out to the character selection screen, wait about 1 minute 30 seconds for the instance to reset (the Twilight Strand has a shorter reset period than other zones), and reenter the game with the same character. This puts the character back at the beginning of the Twilight Strand.  Continue killing Hillock and then log out until reaching level 7, at which point Oni-Goroshi may drop from Hillock.  To speed up this procedure, a batch of three or four new characters can be used in serial to farm Hillock in this manner (each Hillock kill takes about 30 seconds with +10% movement speed boots). Considering that reaching level 7 requires 19 324 experience points, and that experience gains from the level 1 monsters diminish with rising character level, this requires around 2 hours of playtime per character to reach level 7 if most monsters are killed each Twilight Strand run. Furthermore, using Scion will allow you to take movement speed nodes on the bottom right of the tree, hence allowing you to gain experience at a faster rate.  Map variants  Stronger versions of Hillock serve as map bosses:    Map  Level  Name  Notes    Dunes Map Dunes Map Map Level: 74 Map Tier: 7 Guild Character : A Travel to this Map by using it in the Templar Laboratory or a personal Map Device. Maps can only be used once.  74  The Blacksmith  Leap Slam Spawns Unstable Aberrations  Version History    Version  Changes    3.2.0    The Oni-Goroshi version of Hillock has more life, deals more damage, and has learned a new trick.     1.3.0c    Fixed a bug where there could be a short clientside freeze when Hillock was killed.     1.1.3    Removed the invulnerability period from Hillock when he is drawing his sword in all difficulties.     1.0.6    Hillock now uses the same triggered effect that the Blacksmith does, in Cruel and Merciless difficulties. The damage of the poison cloud produced by his zombies has been reduced in all instances (including Maps).

Made the error of not picking a Scion for this as they get early access to movement nodes. I had thought rogue worked for + movement, but not really seeing it based on getting to level 7. I had a unique claw drop though.      1                    Posted Sat Jan 13, 2018 9:38 pm     QuickReply    QuickQuote    Reply    Quote             [+] Dice rolls                          Front Page | Welcome | Contact | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | Advertise | Support BGG | Feeds   Geekdo, BoardGameGeek, the Geekdo logo, and the BoardGameGeek logo are trademarks of BoardGameGeek, LLC.                                   we're hiring!  blog  about imgur  imgur store  imgur apps  developer api  advertise  need help?      terms  privacy  ad choices           Upload Images  Video to GIF  Make a Meme      New post                  sign in    sign up                   Possible League first Oni-Goroshi?

A) Are you waiting the 1:30 or whatever to allow the instance to reset? B) I wouldn't be shocked at all if they nerfed the spawn rate      Download x64 PoEHUD ( DirectX 11 in PoE's settings)  Download x86 PoEHUD ( DirectX 9 in PoE's settings) (Not currently working in 3.2.0) Areas with corrupted side zones change the area title color. You can change this to a preload in the preload menu.

That's why I always kill the first zombie to make sure every time I log back onto the character it is a fresh instance if the zombie isn't dead. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, I'll keep trying and update back here later!

Just always remember to wait 90secs (I was using a timer for that).  About the preload, if you have the last update from poeHUD, should work, just make sure when you click in the settins ( "=") the option preload alert is on (not red).
