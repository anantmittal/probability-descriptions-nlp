A new study from the University of Miami found that South Florida faces a small but real risk of tsunamis generated by landslides on the undersea slopes west of the Bahamas. Such landslides have occurred in the distant past, presumably causing tsunamis then, and they are likely to occur again, according to the study published in the journal Scientific Reports. In the worst-case scenario, the largest possible quantity of mud and sand would plunge to the ocean floor from Great Bahama Bank, displacing enough water to slam South Florida with a 15-foot tsunami. While a wave of that height may not sound impressive, it represents something far more powerful than an ordinary 15-foot wave, since a tsunami is a wall of water that carries a vast amount of water behind it. But there's no reason to flee to higher ground yet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rates the tsunami risk for the east coast of Florida as low, compared to "very low" for the Gulf coast and "high to very high" for the Pacific coast. The authors of the study say there's no reason to revise that assessment.  "We're still low risk," said Jara Schnyder, lead author of the study and a graduate student at UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. She said the frequency of such events could be measured in the hundreds of thousands of years.       "Even if we have an earthquake that might trigger this, it would have to trigger a landslide with a big enough mass and fast enough propagation to generate a tsunami. That's why we call these low-probability but high- impact events." Working with her were other scientists from UM, as well as scientists from the University of Delaware, Université de Bordeaux in France and University of Bremen in Germany.  In the most likely scenario, an earthquake off the Cuban coast would generate the landslide, although landslides could also occur spontaneously. Gregor Eberli, professor of marine geosciences at UM and senior author of the study, said it would take a powerful earthquake, one scoring 5.5 on the Richter scale or higher, to generate a big enough landslide to cause a tsunami, and those are rare. The area at risk would depend on the location of the landslide. The study looked at Great Bahama Bank, one of the geologic platforms that supports the islands of the Bahamas. If the landslide took place there, the area at risk would range from Cuba to the Keys to Miami Beach. If the landslide took place at the Little Bahama Bank, the at-risk area would extend up the Florida coast to southern St. Lucie County, Eberli said. And there are scenarios that fall short of the worst-case. The size of the tsunami would depend on the amount and velocity of the mud and sand sliding to the ocean floor. At best, it might be barely noticeable or generate severe rip currents. Other scenarios call for significant tsunamis, but ones smaller than a house-smashing 15-footer. Facing far more devastation would be Cuba. The worst-case for that island would be a tsunami reaching a catastrophic 31feet. Tsunamis are most common in the Pacific Ocean, where continental plate boundaries that rim the Pacific generate the string of volcanoes and earthquake zones known as the Ring of Fire. But while earthquake-generated tsunamis are the most common, there have been tsunamis in which undersea landslides, often caused by earthquakes, played the largest role in generating the giant waves. A rare Atlantic tsunami took place in 1929, when an earthquake off Newfoundland created an undersea landslide that caused a tsunami that killed more than two dozen people. In the Pacific, a 1998 earthquake caused an undersea landslide that generated a 23-foot tsunami that destroyed coastal villages and killed more than 2,000 people. Eberli said a tsunami hitting Florida would be unlikely to be that devastating, although he said it could be a cause of concern for the Turkey Point nuclear power plant. "The tsunami risk is not great enough to make damage like what they have in Japan," he said. "It could be quite devastating for coastal buildings. But it will not be like tens of thousands of people will drown. It's not that kind of event." dfleshler@sun-sentinel.com , 954-356-4535      2017 could bring active hurricane season, report says   Idle Heat can clinch division tonight; Cavs possibility could be removed   Two gay men attacked, beaten after Gay Pride Parade, Miami Beach cops say      Copyright

March 11, 2011 at 5:31 pm       Filed Under: Bart Hagemeyer , Canary Islands , Could A Tsunami Affect Florida , Earthquake , Florida , Michael Williams , National Weather Service , NOAA , South Florida , Tsunami    (CBS4)  MIAMI (CBS4) – South Floridians know how to prepare for a disaster, after all, we’ve got hurricane season year after year. But in the wake of the devastating earthquake and massive tsunami in Japan, many people are wondering whether a tsunami could strike Florida.  While we’d like the answer to be ‘no chance’ at all, it’s not that simple. There is actually a “very remote chance” a tsunami could hit the Sunshine State. The good news? Most tsunamis are associated with major earthquakes which makes the possibility of a tsunami hitting Florida’s East Coast very small.  The Atlantic Ocean basin does not have large faults like the Pacific, which are associated both with earthquakes and tsunamis. It is thought that rare underwater landslides would pose a greater risk in the Atlantic Ocean.  While the Caribbean region does have a history of both earthquakes and tsunamis, they have not impacted Florida’s coastlines.  Regardless, the Weather Service and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have a warning system in place, which includes a network of buoys in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and have encouraged several communities along the nation’s East Coast to enroll in the Tsunami Ready program.  The two in the program in Florida are Indian Harbour Beach in Brevard County and Naval Station Mayport near Jacksonville.  Although many people envision a tsunami as one gigantic wall of water, it’s actually a series of powerful fast-moving waves that can suddenly inundate a shoreline. A tsunami can travel at speeds of 500 to 600 mph. A major tsunami will cross an entire ocean before it slows and rises in a towering wall of water.  Such catastrophic waves are unlikely but not impossible for Florida and the nation’s East Coast, according to tsunami researchers, while Caribbean island dwellers have more reason to be wary.  Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake.  The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea.  That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “mega-tsunami,” according to Hagemeyer.  Still, Florida has one big factor in its favor. The shallow waters off Florida’s coasts will act as a breakwater, dissipating a tsunami’s energy.

Bahamas Top Stories    2004-12-30 09:39:25  Slim Possibility Of Tsunamis In Bahamas  In the event of a sizable tsunami there would be no recourse for The Bahamas. The Bahamas would experience total destruction at a level never witnessed here before.   With the death toll from the weekend tsunamis in Asia topping 55,000, many island nations, like The Bahamas, have been left to wonder whether such an occurrence could happen elsewhere.  Carl Smith, director of the National Emergency Management Agency, admitted yesterday that The Bahamas government is interested in knowing whether such a natural disaster could ever be possible in this region.  Robert Weisberg, professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida, said in a Florida press report yesterday that Florida's greatest risk for tsunami occurrence emanates from the Puerto Trench, however island masses' like The Bahamas lay directly in its path.  If something did happen in the Caribbean, there are things in the way  The Bahamas. The effects we'd feel would be tempered by the fact that we have other land masses in the way,' he told news-press.com.  But he indicated that such an occurrence is highly unlikely.  Although The Bahamas is located in a benign region with respect to tsunamis, earthquakes do happen in the Caribbean Sea.  Tsunami, which is Japanese for harbor wave, are caused by undersea tectonic activity triggered by earthquakes, submarine volcanic eruptions, and submarine landslides.  Dr. Margaret Wiggins-Grandison, seismologist and head of the Earthquake Unit at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, told the Bahama Journal yesterday that it is possible for The Bahamas to experience a tsunami, but the likelihood is not that great.  An island in the Pacific would have a greater probability of impact because of the nature of the continental boundaries in the Atlantic when it is compared to the continental boundaries in the Pacific,' she said.  In 1755 there was a massive earthquake off the coast of Portugal and a tsunami reached as far as the Caribbean.  However, the tsunami was not as devastating upon arrival in the Caribbean. Barbados experienced waves as high as four feet,' Dr. Wiggins-Grandison said.  She explained that earthquakes are the primary triggers, generating the largest tsunamis.  This is because displacement of the sea floor vertically occurs with great force during earthquakes,' Dr. Wiggins-Grandison said.  She said in the event of a sizable tsunami there would be no recourse for The Bahamas. This is because many Bahamian islands are just above sea level with no mountains or high ground to escape, she said.  Dr. Wiggins-Grandison added that The Bahamas would experience total destruction at a level never witnessed here before.  It would no doubt catch Bahamians by surprise as it did hundreds of thousands of people in Asia and parts of Africa.  Ravi Jesubatham, a native of Sri Lanka who lives in The Bahamas, said that tsunamis were unheard off in Sri Lanka because the country usually experiences only natural disasters like small mudslides.  I was surprised at first mention of this disaster because in Sri Lanka we do not get earthquakes, tornadoes or hurricanes  in fact we do not experience any large scale natural disaster,' he said.  I have not heard of any losses in my family, only injuries like my cousin, her husband, and son were injured badly while attending a weeding. In my opinion there are two major concerns in Sri Lanka which include the health of the people who are unaware of how to handle natural disasters, and what effects the tsunami will have on the recently rebounding tourism sector in Sri Lanka.'  Mr. Jesubatham reminded Bahamians that a small contribution from a small island nation would go a long way in Sri Lanka because of the difference in currency. He said that Bahamians should be mindful that natural disasters can occur anywhere at anytime without warning.

Warner Bros. Pictures via YouTube        Share     Share     Tweet               Comment     Email     Print        A new study calls attention to the tsunami hazard posed by a little-understood jumble of seafloor faults off the coast of Southern California — just in time to ride the wave of hype generated by the big-budget disaster movie "San Andreas."  The study's lead author, geologist Mark Legg, says a real-life offshore earthquake and tsunami wouldn't exactly follow Hollywood's script for a washout of Los Angeles or San Diego. Nevertheless, he says the hazard deserves more attention than it's received.  "That has not been looked at carefully when it comes to the potential for large earthquakes and tsunamis from offshore faults," Legg, who runs a Southern California consulting firm called Legg Geophysical , told NBC News.    advertisement            Play                 Facebook    Twitter    Embed      What would happen if a tsunami hit California?  2:06   autoplay  autoplay     Copy this code to your website or blog         Other earthquake experts insist the hazard has been looked at, but they acknowledge that the offshore faults are worthy of further study. "It's a complicated picture, and this is an important piece of it," said Lucy Jones, science adviser for risk reduction in the U.S. Geological Survey's Natural Hazards Mission Area.  Legg's latest research paper, accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface , looks at a mostly underwater seismic region known as the California Continental Borderland. He said surveys of the region show a "complicated logjam" of faults caused by the smash-up of the Pacific tectonic plate and the North American plate.  The research draws upon mapping data from a depth survey in 2010 that covered more than 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) of fault lines on the ocean floor, plus data from earlier surveys. Legg and his colleagues focused on two fault zones in the Borderland — the Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge Fault and the Ferrelo Fault.  Based on their measurements, the researchers determined that the seafloor crust in those areas was subject to horizontal strike-slip forces as well as vertical compression. Computer models showed that the offshore faults were capable of generating magnitude-8 earthquakes.  Legg said earlier underwater surveys found evidence of vertical movement along faults in the Borderland, amounting to as much as 10 feet (3 meters) — the kind of movement that can generate tsunami waves. "There's a smoking gun," Legg said.         This map shows the California Continental Borderland and its major tectonic features, as well as the locations of earthquakes greater than magnitude 5.5. The dashed box shows the area of the new study. Large arrows show relative plate motion for the Pacific-North America fault boundary.  AGU     Related:  California Tsunami Would Have Costly Aftermath   What kind of tsunami?  Jones said there's been evidence that tsunami waves have hit Southern California going back to 1812, when a huge wave apparently generated by a 7.2 quake in the Santa Barbara Channel pushed a 283-ton trading ship a half-mile inland and then pulled it back out to sea. (The ship survived the ordeal.)    advertisement     But anytime someone mentions the word "tsunami," people think of the 2004 quake and tsunami that devastated Sumatra and other Indian Ocean coastal areas, or the giant waves that hit Japan in 2011 . Those tsunami waves were generated in subduction zones, where one tectonic plate dives beneath another. Jones said the "transpression" faults that are the focus of Legg's research wouldn't produce such dramatic results.  "It's not that it's not a risk," Jones said. "It's just not as big a risk as the ones we see from the big subduction zones. "  The zone that's closest to Southern California is the Cascadia subduction zone, which lies off the coast of Northern California, Oregon and Washington state. A Cascadia quake in the year 1700 produced a tsunami so big that it caused damage on Japan's Pacific coast .  Legg agreed that a Borderland tsunami might not be on the scale of a Cascadia tsunami, or the Sumatra tsunami — or the "San Andreas" tsunami, for that matter.  "It doesn't have to be a Sumatra-sized tsunami," he told NBC News. "It could be a 1- or 2-meter surge. That could have a huge impact on the ports."        Related:  'San Andreas' fact and fiction from Earthquake Country   Don't panic, but be prepared  The way Legg sees it, there are two big takeaways. The first one is: Don't panic, but be prepared.  "Worrying doesn't do anyone any good," he said. "Preparedness is the key." For example, if you're on the beach and see the ocean receding dramatically, run to higher ground — because a big tsunami wave is probably on its way.    advertisement     The other takeaway is that undersea faults need to be studied more closely. He pointed out that the federal government had funded seafloor depth mapping, also known as bathymetry, for Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal waters — but the funding was cut before a Pacific coastal survey could be completed.  That has forced researchers to assemble a patchwork picture of Southern California's offshore faults. Legg would like to see more resources devoted to mapping the seafloor, preferably before the big waves roll in.  "This is not a billion-dollar job. Probably for a few million dollars you could finish the California Borderland," he said. "We have excellent maps of Mars and Mercury — and now they're talking about high-resolution imagery of Pluto. But we still don't have high-resolution bathymetry of our own backyard."   In addition to Legg, the authors of "High-Resolution Mapping of Two Large-Scale Transpressional Fault Zones in the California Continental Borderland: Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge and Ferrelo Faults" include Monica Kohler, Tatsumi Shintaku and Dayanthie Weeraratne. The research is the focus of a news release from the American Geophysical Union , which publishes the Journal of Geophysical Research.

A tsunami (pronounced "soo-nahm'ee") is a series of waves generated by an undersea disturbance such as an earthquake. From the area of the disturbance, the waves will travel outward in all directions, much like the ripples caused by throwing a rock into a pond. The time between wave crests may be from 5 to 90 minutes, and the wave speed in the open ocean may be more than 450 miles per hour. Tsunamis have reached heights of more than 100 feet. As the waves approach shallow coastal waters, they appear normal and the speed decreases. Then as the tsunami nears the coastline, it may grow to great height and smash into the shore, causing great destruction and loss of life.   Tsunamis are caused by an underwater disturbance - usually an undersea earthquake. Landslides, volcanic eruptions, and even meteorites can also generate a tsunami.  Tsunamis can originate hundreds or even thousands of miles away from coastal areas. Local geography may intensify the effect of a tsunami. Areas at greatest risk are less than 50 feet above sea level and within one mile of the shoreline.  People who are near the seashore during a strong earthquake should listen to a radio for a tsunami warning and be ready to evacuate at once to higher ground.  Rapid changes in the water level are an indication of an approaching tsunami.  Tsunamis arrive as a series of successive "crests" (high water levels) and "troughs" (low water levels). These successive crests and troughs can occur anywhere from 5 to 90 minutes apart. They usually occur 10 to 45 minutes apart.   What is the Tsunami Risk to the Gulf of Mexico? Tsunamis have occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1991, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Costa Rica produced a six foot high tsunami that flooded nearly 1,000 feet inland on the Caribbean side of the country. The Caribbean also has a number of active submarine volcanoes and fault systems that are capable of producing earthquakes large enough to generate tsunamis. The Gulf is also at risk from very large tsunamis that originate in the Atlantic Ocean, like the one produced by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. There are no authoritative estimates of the extent of the risk that these hazards may pose to states with coastlines on the Gulf of Mexico.  Warning of a Tsunami Threat There is presently no dedicated tsunami warning system for the Gulf of Mexico, but government agencies can be expected to disseminate warnings of potential threats caused by seismic and volcanic events through the Emergency Alert System and the news media. The U.S. Pacific tsunami detection and warning system is in the process of
being expanded to include the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and areas of the Atlantic that could affect the U.S. coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will deploy 32 new tsunami detection buoys for a more extensive tsunami warning system by mid-2007.  Tsunami Preparedness & Response Actions If you live, work, or are visiting in a coastal area and are advised that a threat of tsunami exists:   Listen to a radio or television to get the latest emergency information, and be ready to evacuate if asked to do so. Keep your family members nearby, so you can evacuate as a group.  Ready your vehicle for a trip, so you do not have to stop to get gas or provisions and, if you have a family emergency supplies kit, put it in the car.  Determine which evacuation route you would use if you have to leave and, if possible, also select an alternate route.  Stay away from the beach. Never go to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave, you are probably too close to escape it.  If you are at the beach, be aware that a noticeable rapid rise or fall in coastal waters is also a sign that a tsunami is approaching. If this occurs, consider this a warning, leave at once, and move inland.   If you are advised by local officials to evacuate:   Move at once to higher ground inland, preferably a place that is significantly higher than the surrounding terrain. Go inland -- do not drive on roads that parallel the coast.  Remain at an inland location until authorities advise it is safe to return.  Remember that a tsunami is a series of waves. Do not assume that because one wave has come ashore that the danger over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.

March 11, 2011 at 5:31 pm       Filed Under: Bart Hagemeyer , Canary Islands , Could A Tsunami Affect Florida , Earthquake , Florida , Michael Williams , National Weather Service , NOAA , South Florida , Tsunami    (CBS4)  MIAMI (CBS4) – South Floridians know how to prepare for a disaster, after all, we’ve got hurricane season year after year. But in the wake of the devastating earthquake and massive tsunami in Japan, many people are wondering whether a tsunami could strike Florida.  While we’d like the answer to be ‘no chance’ at all, it’s not that simple. There is actually a “very remote chance” a tsunami could hit the Sunshine State. The good news? Most tsunamis are associated with major earthquakes which makes the possibility of a tsunami hitting Florida’s East Coast very small.  The Atlantic Ocean basin does not have large faults like the Pacific, which are associated both with earthquakes and tsunamis. It is thought that rare underwater landslides would pose a greater risk in the Atlantic Ocean.  While the Caribbean region does have a history of both earthquakes and tsunamis, they have not impacted Florida’s coastlines.  Regardless, the Weather Service and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have a warning system in place, which includes a network of buoys in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and have encouraged several communities along the nation’s East Coast to enroll in the Tsunami Ready program.  The two in the program in Florida are Indian Harbour Beach in Brevard County and Naval Station Mayport near Jacksonville.  Although many people envision a tsunami as one gigantic wall of water, it’s actually a series of powerful fast-moving waves that can suddenly inundate a shoreline. A tsunami can travel at speeds of 500 to 600 mph. A major tsunami will cross an entire ocean before it slows and rises in a towering wall of water.  Such catastrophic waves are unlikely but not impossible for Florida and the nation’s East Coast, according to tsunami researchers, while Caribbean island dwellers have more reason to be wary.  Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake.  The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea.  That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “mega-tsunami,” according to Hagemeyer.  Still, Florida has one big factor in its favor. The shallow waters off Florida’s coasts will act as a breakwater, dissipating a tsunami’s energy.

March 24, 2014 June 4, 2016  by Michael Snyder     332 1 0 0  Can you imagine the devastation that would be caused if a massive wall of water several hundred feet high slammed into Florida at more than 100 miles an hour?  To many people such a scenario is impossible, but that is what people living along the Indian Ocean thought before the 2004 tsunami and that is what people living in Japan thought before the 2011 tsunami.  Throughout history, giant tsunamis have been relatively rare events, but they do happen.  Scientists tell us that a mega-tsunami can race across the open ocean at up to 500 miles an hour, and when they reach shore they can produce waves that are hundreds of feet high.  And even though authorities claim that the threat to Florida is “remote”, it might surprise you to learn that there are “ Tsunami Hazard Zone ” signs on Florida beaches.  If a highly unusual event (such as a giant meteor hitting the Atlantic Ocean) caused a giant tsunami that hit Florida, the devastation would be absolutely unimaginable.  Most people don’t realize this, but almost the entire bottom half of Florida is just barely above sea level.  If a giant tsunami did hit Florida, there would be nothing to stop it from sweeping across the entire state…  South Florida has two big problems. The first is its remarkably flat topography. Half the area that surrounds Miami is less than five feet above sea level . Its highest natural elevation, a limestone ridge that runs from Palm Beach to just south of the city, averages a scant 12 feet. With just three feet of sea-level rise, more than a third of southern Florida will vanish; at six feet, more than half will be gone; if the seas rise 12 feet, South Florida will be little more than an isolated archipelago surrounded by abandoned buildings and crumbling overpasses. And the waters won’t just come in from the east – because the region is so flat, rising seas will come in nearly as fast from the west too, through the Everglades.  Even worse, South Florida sits above a vast and porous limestone plateau. “Imagine Swiss cheese, and you’ll have a pretty good idea what the rock under southern Florida looks like,” says Glenn Landers, a senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This means water moves around easily – it seeps into yards at high tide, bubbles up on golf courses, flows through underground caverns, corrodes building foundations from below. “Conventional sea walls and barriers are not effective here,” says Robert Daoust, an ecologist at ARCADIS, a Dutch firm that specializes in engineering solutions to rising seas.  Of course the authorities do all that they can to play down this potential threat.  They say that it is “highly unlikely” that a tsunami will ever hit Florida.  The following comes from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection …  Although it is highly unlikely that a tsunami will impact Florida, it is not impossible. Floridians may also travel to locations where tsunamis are more likely. It is vital to know (and instruct children) that if the ocean suddenly recedes from the shore do not stand and stare. It is necessary immediately to run uphill or away from the shore and go to the highest location possible which may mean up the stairs of a substantial building. Everyone should be aware that no matter where in the world they are, if the sea is observed to recede from the shore, they should immediately run for high ground.  That last part is quite funny.  There is no “high ground” until you get to north Florida.  If a mega-tsunami strikes, there is going to be no place to hide.  And large tsunamis do happen in the Atlantic Ocean from time to time.  For example, National Geographic says that there have been 37 verified tsunamis in the Caribbean since 1498…  The Caribbean has been hit by 37 verified tsunamis since 1498. Some were generated locally and others were the result of events far away, such as the earthquake near Portugal.  In recent years, there have been some scientists that have been concerned about what would happen if there was a major earthquake in the Caribbean region or a volcanic eruption in the Canary Islands.  The following comes from CBS News …  Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake.  The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea.  That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “ mega-tsunami ,” according to Hagemeyer.  So what would such a “mega-tsunami” look like?  Well, according to Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Ward, it could produce a wall of water approximately 164 feet high …  Dr Day, working in conjunction with Dr Steven Ward of the University of California, has now produced an updated model that predicts more accurately the size of the tsunami and the areas it will impact.  The model predicts that after the landslide the tsunami would travel a distance of almost 155 miles in just 10 minutes and would reach the Caribbean and Florida in eight or nine hours.  The forecast goes on to predict that a wall of water 164ft high could smash into the coasts of the Caribbean and Florida, while Brazil’s northern coast could be hit by a wave more than 130ft high.  Personally, however, I am convinced that the much greater potential threat comes from above.  According to the University of California at Santa Cruz website , if a massive asteroid were to crash into the Atlantic Ocean it could produce a giant tsunami with a wall of water as high as 400 feet that would slam into the east coast of the United States…  If an asteroid crashes into the Earth, it is likely to splash down somewhere in the oceans that cover 70 percent of the planet’s surface. Huge tsunami waves, spreading out from the impact site like the ripples from a rock tossed into a pond, would inundate heavily populated coastal areas. A computer simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the Atlantic Coast of the United States.  In case you were wondering, yes, that would be absolutely catastrophic.  Major U.S. cities stretching from the tip of Florida all the way up to Maine would essentially be destroyed.  The following is an excerpt from an article posted on Modern Survival Blog …  300 foot tsunami would be the probable devastation of the following major East Coast cities…  Portland, ME (~ 50′) Boston, MA (~ 30′) New Haven, CT (~ 50′) Bridgeport, CT (~ 40′) New York City, NY (~ 20′) Jersey City, NJ (~ 30′) Newark, NJ (~ 50′) Atlantic City, NJ (~ 10′) Wilmington, DE (~ 80′) Philadelphia, PA (~ 40′) Virginia Beach, VA (~ 10′) Wilmington, NC (~ 20′) Myrtle Beach, SC (~ 20′) Charleston, SC (~ 10′) Savannah, GA (~ 10′) Daytona Beach, FL (less than 10′) West Palm Beach, FL (less than 10′) Fort Lauderdale, FL (less than 10′) Miami, FL (less than 10′)  There are countless cities in between these coastal cities. The Eastern Seaboard of the United States includes some of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Over one third of the country (more than 100 million people) live along the East Coast. Evacuation would be virtually impossible for most (except for the astute who act quickly) due to only hours notice, probable doubt, and the subsequent immediate gridlock that would follow.  Most scientists would tell you that the possibility of such a thing is extremely small.  But could it be possible that they are wrong?  At this point, more than 10,000 major near earth objects have been discovered, and about 10 percent of them are one kilometer or larger in size.  And there are many more out there that are still undiscovered.  In fact, scientists are discovering new ones all the time.  Sometimes, astronomers only spot them after they have passed our planet.  What is even more alarming is that the number of “fireball events” that are being recorded appears to be greatly increasing.  Just check out this chart from the American Meteor Society …   So why is this happening?  Why are so many large rocks suddenly flying by so close to our planet?  Has something fundamentally changed?  And what is going to happen when a really giant rock slams into us one day?

The article leaves out that the island housing the Cumbre Vieja Volcano was built by the extinct volcano of the north end of the island and the active Cumbre Vieja of the southern end of the island. It built itself as a Stratavolcano more on par to Anuk Krakatau/Krakatoa than the Shield volcanoes like Hawaii. 2). The article also leaves out that the risk of flank collapse is derived by an eruption a few years ago destabilized the western flank and starting a rift through the center of the island priming the western flank to be pushed into the Atlantic with a major eruption.  Cumbre Vieja flank collapse is primed; it just needs the catalyst.        raptor45     Not a problem…..water          2Gary2     I think this would put out the lake of fire.        Hammerstrike     youtube.c om/watch?v=yDqwlAU2QYs          Miss M     Did you know that dozens of people are having dreams about a tsunami?  The most interesting part of these dreams is most of them have them around 2am, and they report the waves to be hundreds of feet high, unlike other tsunami’s.  Check out the videos, and comments of people having dreams about the EAST COAST, FLORIDA, and CALIFORNIA…  It is really interesting that so many people are seeing the same thing. http://whygodreallyexists.com/archives/dividing-israels-land-judgement-for-the-united-states-visions        Hammerstrike     Jormungandr is stirring.        Rose     That is true. I have been dreaming of huge tsunamis coming for about 20 years now. In the last tsunami dream I was on different shorelines and saw the wave coming in. In some places the waves were so tall the swept over the tops of hotels and in other places the wave was not quite as tall but devastating just the same. In these dreams I am never harmed but I can see everything. The water literally goes over my head and I am under the water. Of course these dreams could be literal or a metaphor for judgements to come. On 9/11 I heard the clock start ticking and I have been prepping ever since.        Hey Mr Fantasy     Does anyone say anything about the Northern Gulf Coast of FL?  The Forgotten/Emerald Coast?          Oldphartbsa     The one to fear, and is most likely, is the avalanche from the Canary Islands.  The volcano is on the edge of a huge rock formation that is poised to break off and slide into the Atlantic.  From what I’ve read, the tsunami coming from that will exceed 600 feet in height and, hopefully, wipe out Washington DC.        corners     if its large enough to wipe our our crooked politicians in DC, it will destroy our country. Just start with oil alone.All that infrastructure would be wiped out, as most of it is on the coast.        Oldphartbsa     “if its large enough to wipe our our crooked politicians in DC, it will destroy our country.”  No, that would SAVE our country.          Paul     I thought the one we were looking out for was the island of LA palma…. I’m sure I misspelled that          Rolling Thunder     I work a few hundred feet from the ocean here in Florida and live about 3 miles inland.  Even if there is warning I’m sure the roads will be so congested there will be no escape.  Guess I’ll try to get into a boat and hope for the best.        corners     i think you would have to motor out to sea, into the tsunami. You are right though, most people couldnt leave even if they wanted too from all the congestion. And we have seen many times what humans do when their lives are on the line,Survival of the fittest kicks in for most.          DJohn1     Funny you should mention Florida’s geology. My folks lived there for years. So about twice a year I visited for a couple of weeks, enjoyed home cooked meals, enjoyed Clearwater beach. I noticed that acid rain was causing a lot of sink holes. Occasionally a house or car was swallowed over night. The thing is Florida is a giant sandbar in the ocean. The limestone comes from the northern hard water flows over a very long time. If the limestone is eaten up by acid rain, it is very likely the entire state will be several feet below the ocean some time in the future. A giant ocean wave could happen and that might send the sands to the bottom. How much of a shallow water barrier is there off the Atlantic Coast of Florida? Where does the really deep Atlantic waters begin? Personally I have always thought of it as the retirement state. A place where humans go to die. Just like the legendary Elephant Burial Grounds of Africa. Just who would benefit if an entire state of senior citizens suddenly died? Well, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Pension Funds, funeral homes if any bodies are found, not sure where it goes from there. But a good portion of the retirement debt of government would suddenly disappear. Oh well, one more conspiracy theory. The nearest safe place might be Kentucky or Ohio. Though the Tennessee mountains might be safe. There is a huge plain that depends on rain from the gulf stream. That also might change leaving the entire area in a huge drought that might not end ever. Systematic disasters seem to be the norm for planet Earth. So this is as likely as it is anywhere else on the planet.        MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse     Very interesting comment.  Thanks for those points DJohn1.  Michael        puckles     Sinkholes are happening everywhere in the world these days, not just in limestone areas, and there are multiple theories as to why this is happening.  One I tend to credit is planetary expansion.  We know it has happened in the past; why should it not now?  It may well be influenced by solar events, which are likely the primary reason for “climate change,” which has existed for millennia–not a recent event, by far.  The members of the IPCC, alas, are not geological historians; if they were, they would know better.        Lee     Great points! If most humans could think in geologic time we’d be much better off. We understand days are hotter than nights. We understand summers are hotter than winters. No one freaks out when it starts snowing in the winter b/c we expect it. For some reason though no one seems to understand ice ages and how our current location in the universe effects our weather. So we are at the end of an ice age and it’s possibly warming up and everyone is freaking out when the reality is it’s heated and cooled since the beginning of time. There is a reason why our core is made of magma and we have earthquakes and volcanoes. If it weren’t for the world cooling down we wouldn’t exist right now. This rock will be heating up and cooling down much longer than we’ll be around.          Hey Mr Fantasy     Depends.  Where I’m from in Southern WV, we have sinkholes as well.  It’s the same Karst topography as FL, just in mountain form.  Supposedly the real reason for the sinkholes is the draining of the FL Aquifer for agriculture.  Coal mining is supposedly responsible for the ones in WV.  Whether or not this is true…well, who knows.  But it makes sense to me (I am not a scientist though).  I wonder about the Panhandle of FL, and the Northern Gulf.  Would it affect that area?  I hope not!  FL is truly a beautiful, amazing state and it’s being destroyed by overpopulation and greedy scum developers that are bound and determined to squeeze every cent they can out of the rape of one of the most stunning places on God’s Earth.  Kind of like the coal mines and WV.  Sad that nothing can be done to stop it, mainly because people worship the Almighty Dollar more than anything else, and have zero respect for anything that doesn’t make them a buck.  Sickening.  I hate to say it but FL needs to be cleansed, I think God created it as a special piece of Heaven on Earth to give us an idea of how it will be…and we have ruined it.  It’s just a tragedy all around, in every way.        Lee Clark     Acid rain doesn’t cause our sink holes. We get lots of rain. In our rainy season we get more rain in ten minutes than CA gets in a decade. Yet it’s still sunny out when it rains. Our rain isn’t really acidic especially when compared to national averages and especially the North East. Our rain reacts with carbon dioxide and decaying vegetation as it sinks/moves down thru the ground to gain it’s acidity. That acidic water erodes soil and rocks underground. That’s just one method to cause them though. Over withdrawal of ground water by humans is another. Movings lots of ground water from one spot and concentrating it in another is another cause. Artificially created ponds of surface water is another cause. Drilling new water wells is yet another. They’ve been happening for thousands of years. They happen all over the world. On to Florida… It’s not a place people go to die. I came here young for a highly lucrative career. I work for a company that’s full of young people doing the same thing. After bouncing all over the country I’ve found it to be the best place to live in America. No state taxes so we keep all of our salary. Low sales taxes too. Plenty of sunshine/blue skies/white clouds. Plenty of clean water/no droughts here. Green all year round. No winter. No snow. Great places to live that are clean and crime free and cost effective compared to most major cities (high end/high quality housing but not expensive). As an example I have a 5,000 square foot house here with pool/hot tub and three car garage/guest house that is the same price as my POS 475 square foot condo was in D.C. (which was cheaper than the one bedroom studio I rented in LA. Big city jobs with big city pay but not all the negatives of a big city. Cost of living and the American dream is easily attainable here compared to the rest of the country. Lots of outdoor activities year round. Awesome state and national parks/forrest etc. Awesome access to the some of the most beautiful beaches in North America. Close to all the cruise lines and Disney Parks. Close to the Bahamas and Caribbean. Lots of personal freedoms. Less restrictive than most states. Lots of lakes/rivers/parks. Great shopping. Great dining. Great boating. The reason I’m reading this article is to decide where to put my Lagoon 450 yacht. Respect your elders. They have lived long lives in crappy parts of the country and have acquired a great deal of life knowledge… they all come here for very good reasons.          johncocktoaston     I’m guessing the number of face-eating cannibals per capita would drop to near zero.

"It's not zero," said Bart Hagemeyer, longtime meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service office in Melbourne. "But the possibility of a tsunami hitting Florida's East Coast is very small." Most tsunamis, also called seismic sea waves, occur in the Pacific and Indian oceans. In those regions, various plates of the Earth's crust grind and joust against each other as one slides over another, breeding earthquakes. The resulting shock of a temblor can propel a wave that will cross an entire ocean, at jet speeds and often imperceptible to ships, before it slows to a relative crawl and rises in a towering wall of water. The history of big waves hitting Florida is short. A powerful earthquake in Portugal in 1755 killed thousands there and launched a tsunami that hit much of the U.S. coast. Scientists don't know if that caused many deaths in Florida, which was sparsely populated at the time. An earthquake in Charleston, S.C., in 1886 triggered a wave that surged up the St. Johns River to Jacksonville, causing few if any deaths. And there was strange incident of a rogue, 18-foot wave that flooded the parked cars of sunbathers on Daytona Beach without warning in 1992. Scientists blamed that on an undersea avalanche, not an earthquake, but it drew much attention. Florida does have a natural defense against a tsunami. The state's shallow, coastal waters will act as a breakwater, dissipating some of the powerful wave's energy. Even though the risk is low, Hagemeyer, other experts and some communities don't ignore the danger. Indian Harbour Beach qualified in 2005 as the U.S. East Coast's first city prepared for a tsunami. The Naval Station Mayport near Jacksonville also holds the designation, and Brevard and Volusia counties include tsunami preparedness in their emergency-management plans. "We've had some people criticize us and say 'You guys are crazy – why do you bother? You're just scaring people,'" said Jackie Burns, city manager at Indian Harbour Beach, a Brevard County community of about 2 square miles and 8,800 residents. To qualify for a National Weather Service TsunamiReady designation, the city installed warning lights along the beach, hooked up a siren and drew up evacuation plans to be carried out by police and firefighters with bullhorns and loudspeakers. They drill regularly on what to do when alerted to a tsunami watch or warning – which hasn't happened yet. Florida also has a short list of what to worry about in the way of tsunami threats. Geologists are keeping an eye on the Puerto Rico trench in the Caribbean for the possibility of a tectonic plate shift – earthquake – that triggers a tsunami. A deadly tsunami, like the one triggered early last year by a major earthquake in Haiti, is more likely to occur in that region than along the U.S. East Coast. An eruption of the active Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands off Africa is thought to be capable of producing a mega-tsunami that could hit Florida. And another major earthquake in Portugal continues to be a worry. A tsunami triggered there would take about eight hours to hit Florida, traveling at 475 mph across open ocean. Since the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2004 that killed nearly a quarter-million people, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has installed dozens of ocean-monitoring buoys, including seven in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Those buoys are watching out for Florida around the clock for what may never endanger anybody alive today. George Maul, director of the Department of Marine Environmental Systems at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, said that looking only at the probability of a tsunami strike on Florida is misleading. A better approach, he said, would be to consider the total risk, which includes the potential frequency of tsunami strikes, the vulnerability of damage to buildings and homes, and the preparedness of communities. Because Florida is poorly prepared, the state's total risk compares to California's, where a strike is more likely but buildings are better designed to withstand one of the waves and residents are better prepared to respond, he said. That's true except for in Indian Harbour Beach, Maul said. "They go through regular drills," Maul said. "They know if a tsunami is coming, they know how much time they have to react, they know what to do in order to get people off the beach."  kspear@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5062.

"Our study calls attention to the possibility that submarine landslides can trigger tsunami waves ," said UM Rosenstiel School Ph.D. student Jara Schnyder, the lead author of the study. "The short distance from the slope failures to the coastlines of Florida and Cuba makes potential tsunamis low-probability but high-impact events that could be dangerous."  The team identified margin collapses and submarine landslides along the slopes of the western Great Bahama Bank—the largest of the carbonate platforms that make up the Bahamas archipelago—using multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection data. These landslides are several kilometers long and their landslide mass can slide up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the basin.  An incipient failure scar of nearly 100 kilometers (70 miles) length was identified as a potential future landslide, which could be triggered by an earthquake that occasionally occur off the coast of Cuba.  Using the mathematical models commonly used to evaluate tsunami potential in the U.S., the researchers then simulated the tsunami waves for multiple scenarios of submarine landslides originating off the Great Bahama Bank to find that submarine landslides and margin collapses in the region could generate dangerous ocean currents and possibly hazardous tsunami waves several meters high along the east coast of Florida and northern Cuba.

By Joey Millar     PUBLISHED:  11:00, Sat, Dec 10, 2016  | UPDATED: 22:54, Sat, Dec 10, 2016            GETTY A tsunami could strike the east coast of America at any moment New York, Boston and Miami could all be struck by the monster wave, while Central and South American tourist hotspots like the Bahamas, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago would also in the firing line. Dr Simon Day said a landslide in the Canary Islands could send the huge wave speeding thousands of miles across the Atlantic to the Americas. The increasingly unstable Cumbre Vieja volcano could dump a chunk of land the size of the Isle of Man into the ocean, triggering a mega-tsunami with deadly consequences.         Related articles       New Zealand rocked by THIRD earthquake as nation facing tsunami alert       Another powerful earthquake measuring 6.9 rocks the Solomon Islands     While it could send a 10 foot wave heading towards the UK and the south coast of Ireland, Dr Day said the real damage will be done in the densely-populated cities of the USA's eastern seaboard. He told Express.co.uk: "A wave could curve towards Britain, depending on the power, but it will have the biggest impact on the Americas."     7.8 earthquake hits New Zealand  Mon, November 14, 2016  A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake has triggered a tsunami off the coast of New Zealand – near the same place a tremor killed dozens of people.          Play slideshow        Twitter/Getty   1 of 16    7.8 earthquake hits New Zealand              Speaking 15 years after he first put forward his study, he admitted not everyone had reacted well to his prediction. He said: "It's [been] fifteen years of controversy. "There was a series of objections. But independent modelling has shown the same things as me. My response is it’s better to know so we can prepare."       GETTY A landslide at the Cumbre Vieja volcano could spark a devastating tsunami A report put forward by Dr Day said waves up to 80 feet in height could strike the Americas should a landslide occur in the Canary Islands. It read: "Even after crossing the Atlantic, a lateral collapse of Cumbre Vieja volcano could impose a great sequence of waves of 10-25 m height on the shores of the Americas." GETTY New York could be struck by a tsunami following a landslide in the Canary Islands While Dr Day's thesis was first mocked by colleagues, authorities are now taking the tsunami threat seriously and preparing for a disaster. Various organisations, including the US Geological Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), now encourage residents living near the coast to prepare for such an event, however unlikely.     Extreme weather: Most dramatic photos ever  Wed, August 2, 2017  The weather across the world is getting wilder and weirder, causing chaos, death and destruction around the globe.          Play slideshow        Caters News Agency   1 of 96    These frightening photos of lightning from a hurricane above Miami, Florida in the USA were taken after the storm left a trail of destruction in the Caribbean.              A spokesman for the NOAA said: "The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2009 Samoa tsunami, the 2010 Chile tsunami, the 2011 Tohoku, Japan tsunami: In less than 10 years, these four events focused the world's attention on the rare but very real threat of tsunamis. "Major tsunamis do not happen often, but when they do, they can have a significant impact on life and property. Even small tsunamis, which are more frequent, can cause loss of life, injuries and considerable damage.       GETTY The same volcanic eruption could also send a tsunami to the UK "In the United States, the threat posed by tsunamis is greatest along the Pacific and Caribbean Coasts, but tsunamis are also possible on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. "Although a tsunami cannot be prevented, the impact of a tsunami can be mitigated through community preparedness, timely warnings, and effective response."

How Far Inland Would A 300 Foot Tsunami Go On The East Coast?    02/12/2013 | Updated 02/21/2018   Ken Jorgustin   397 Comments       TSUNAMI EAST COAST TERRAIN MAPS SHOWN BELOW  Awhile ago I wrote an article titled “ 300 Foot Tsunami And East Coast Destruction ” regarding the possibility of ‘La Palma’ or ‘El Hierro’ of the Canary Islands partially collapsing into the Eastern Atlantic following a major volcanic eruption there.  This event would likely lead to a mega tsunami that travels across the Atlantic and devastates the East Coast of the United States.  Opinions vary regarding the height of the tsunami and range from 60 feet, to 300 feet, and even higher than that as it rolls up the shoreline of the East Coast of the United States and elsewhere.      How Far Will The Tsunami Go Inland?  “IF” a 300 foot tsunami reached the East Coast, how far inland would it go?  Logically one might reason that the tsunami will travel inland until the elevation of the land is higher than the tsunami. While that sounds logical, there are variables…  Actually, the distance a tsunami will travel inland has more to do with the energy remaining as it hits the shore.  A tsunami will speed across the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour but at a relatively small height (because the ocean is DEEP).  It’s speed decreases as it approaches the shoreline (because the ground beneath it is getting shallower) but it’s energy begins to transfer to its monstrous HEIGHT.  When the speed of the wave approaches zero, the wave breaks, much of its energy is released, and it will not go too much further. A tsunami that reaches a height of 300 feet when it rears up at the shore, will lose energy as it travels inland.  It’s all about energy. Frequency (depending on the source of the tsunami) and Amplitude (shape of ocean floor, shoreline and up-slope factors).  It is conceivable that a given tsunami may rear up quickly (and very high) once it reaches the shore (depending on the shape of the ocean floor leading to the shore), and then ‘break’ and lose much of it’s energy in a relatively short distance. While another tsunami may be more compressed (in frequency) and be thrust forward very quickly while traveling a long distance inland (remember Japan?).  There are scientifically sound reasons for concern that at some point in time a mega tsunami could engulf the entire East Coast with a wave approximating 300 feet in height and sweep everything and everybody inland. The consequences of such an event are nearly unimaginable.    Tsunami Maps (East Coast Terrain)  Out of curiosity and an interest in maps, I have custom built the following elevation maps based on high resolution data from USGS digital elevation maps of the United States, particularly the East Coast. I have modeled several layers of elevation of the East Coast to illustrate various height scenarios of tsunami versus geography as it travels inland.  Having said that, there are many variables and factors affecting how far a tsunami would travel inland. So if you live 20 miles inland along the Florida coast (for example) at an elevation of 50 feet doesn’t necessarily mean that a 300 foot tsunami (at the shore) will have enough remaining energy to travel all the way to your location.  There are some instances whereby such a tsunami would probably only travel several miles inland while there are other scenarios where it may roar up a river way or bay and devastate far inland.  Regardless of the factors, I felt that you may be curious to see following elevation graphics that I layered together which increment 75 feet all the way to 300 feet in height along the U.S. East Coast. I would guesstimate that if you live within 20 miles of the coast, you may be vulnerable to a Canary Island ‘event’. However this is simply my own estimation.  Which Cities Might Be Devastated?  Several observations regarding a 300 foot tsunami would be the probable devastation of the following major East Coast cities…  CITY, (Current elevation above sea level, feet)  Portland, ME (~ 50′) Boston, MA (~ 30′) New Haven, CT (~ 50′) Bridgeport, CT (~ 40′) New York City, NY (~ 20′) Jersey City, NJ (~ 30′) Newark, NJ (~ 50′) Atlantic City, NJ (~ 10′) Wilmington, DE (~ 80′) Philadelphia, PA (~ 40′) Virginia Beach, VA (~ 10′) Wilmington, NC (~ 20′) Myrtle Beach, SC (~ 20′) Charleston, SC (~ 10′) Savannah, GA (~ 10′) Daytona Beach, FL (less than 10′) West Palm Beach, FL (less than 10′) Fort Lauderdale, FL (less than 10′) Miami, FL (less than 10′)  There are countless cities and towns in between these coastal cities. The Eastern Seaboard of the United States includes some of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Over one third of the country (more than 100 million people) live along the East Coast. Evacuation would be virtually impossible for most (except for the astute who act quickly) due to only hours notice, probable doubt, and the subsequent immediate gridlock that would follow.  The maps below simply show elevation (not the expected distance a 300 foot tsunami would actually travel). With that said, the maps provide visualization and reference.    NOTE: An evacuation plan should include: Road Atlas Map For Each State    Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York Coastal Elevation Map     Chesapeake Bay & North Carolina Coastal Elevation Map     North and South Carolina Coastal Elevation Map     Georgia Coastal Elevation Map     Florida Coastal Elevation Map    As is obvious, Florida in particular would be wiped out for many many miles inland from its coast.

We are about 20 miles from the shore line and about 200′ above sea level.  I figured that the rivers would be affected by tsunamis but I wasn’t sure how far inland it would go.  We are less than a mile from a river, so that was a little concern for us.    Reply          Ken  02/12/2013 3:05 PM       It looks to me like your location is fine, in my own opinion, given that even a 300′ tsunami would lose energy (and height) as it travels inland. 20 miles is a long way… Now if you were five miles, that’s most likely another story…    Reply          Mark  04/12/2015 11:39 AM       Will my family be safe in Smithfield ,RI?

Do you have any further depictions of the northern 4/5ths of Maine?

When disasters happen, people go into a phase of survive the fittest. Also, food shortages, electrical power, clean water, and waste sanitation.. So technically saying, if a tsunami was to come inland, it would also push a lot of junk inland, desolating the area..its a lot to take in consideration on a situation like this. The best thing I can say is pray that you and yours are safe..and if help is needed by your fellow man or neighbor, help them.    Reply          Mongoose  10/25/2017 9:05 PM       The biggest problem will be surviving the aftermath even if you are lucky enough to survive it.. The damage to infrastructure will make you dependent on what you have with you. Those inland will be left on their own odds are with no power or deliveries of anything for weeks at least. Disaster recovery efforts will be spotty at best as every state and federal agency will be overwhelmed if they survive the wave.

As for as this is concerned, they will think first of all that it’s just not ever going to happen, and then even if they toss that around in their head (the thought of it really happening) they will procrastinate, and do nothing. So, chances are when it happens they will be where they are and either die or have to survive with nothing…SIMPLE!

They are saying with a possible Drastic Pole shift happening soon from Planet X or some are calling it 7x account its 7 times larger than Earth, coming into our Galaxy and then going by us and then around us between Jupiter and Earth in its elliptical orbit, there will be 400ft to 600ft Tsunamis happening around the world. They are saying this Orbit around us will take 150-152 Days. It has already started to affect our Weather since 2016, which will get more violent as it gets closer. The US Navy has drawn up Flood Maps showing where we will lose roughly about 150 Miles of our Coast Lines around the USA. The Missippi River will be 50-100 miles across, and the Great Lakes will become one Big Lake. Think of a line from Chicago to St Louis down to the Gulf of Mexico which lies on a major Fault Line. This event is going to cause Massive Earth Quakes, Volcano Eruptions, Massive Flooding,  Fires, Starvation, Extreme High Winds(75-200mph), etc,, around the World. You will probably have to be indoors for at least 5 months, and maybe longer. Each Area will be affected differently. Planet 7X is also pulling in its Gravitational path Large Astroids that will also pelt the World causing more destruction. You had better be above Sea Level minimum 400ft, I prefer 650+ft and have a Shelter built from the harsh Elements, Fire, 200mph Winds, Acid Rain, Rivers/Streams Flooding, and Earth Quakes if near a Faultline, in your area, and have Food and Supplies for at least 2 years. 80% of the World, about 8 Billion People now, lives by the Ocean. Tsunamis can hit from 100mph – 600+mph, so you don’t really have time to react. There is a lot of Smart People from NASA, Scientist, and other sources putting out this Info if you look, Read, Listen. Big Business has slowly been moving its Headquarters/Business’s for the last 20 years out of these Danger Zones. In 1992 a NASA Researcher first noticed Planet X coming into our System and he has mysteriously killed soon afterward. NASA didn’t acknowledge it till 2005. The Russians and the Chinese, and others have been building large Structures to house many 1000’s of People on High Ground. Watch the Weather, Watch the Military, Watch the Rich who have their bugout Shelters, Watch the High-Level Govenment People. Once they institute Martial Law, as the Bad Weather used as the Ploy, it will be too late too really do anything. Martial Law will mean Travel Restrictions, Food Restrictions, Gasoline Restrictions, etc. Vice President Al Gore gave You a hint about 20 years ago, that the Weather would start to change around 2016, he said from Green House Gas’s, but what he was telling you was about Planet X coming. The North pole has already been moving. This Planet comes by roughly every 4500 years, never the same +/- 500 years. In the Bible, it’s referred to as the Red Planet account you can see it with your naked eye about a year before it goes by, and there will be about 3-4 days of total darkness. The Weather changing drastically will be your first big Notice, account we will start to have multiple Volcanoes get active around the World (Bali just became active), Tornados where we never had them before. More Earth Quakes on Land and in the Ocean, so some causing Tsunamis. Don’t say you weren’t warned!    Reply          Rich in Iowa 920ft  01/27/2018 1:33 AM       The highest Elevation in Flordia is like 55ft, so even a small 150ft tsunami would probably sweep over most of the State. Florida is 361 miles wide and 447 miles long. If an Earth Quake happens in just 5000ft of Ocean, it’s Speed alone could be 600+mph. You don’t have time to react.  The Great Galveston Hurricane,[1] known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900,[2][3][4] was a Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 145 mph (233 km/h), which made landfall on September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, in the United States. It killed 6,000 to 12,000 people, making it the deadliest hurricane and natural disaster in U.S. history. That’s just a Tidal Surge.  The Highest Tsunami on Record is like 1730ft! I don’t know at what Speed it hit Alaska.    Reply          Rich in Iowa 920ft  01/27/2018 9:31 AM       You really should update your Map Model for up to 650ft Tsunamis!

I have watched a few documentaries on mega-tsunamis, and there are various opinions regarding the height of a Canary Island event reaching the East Coast. I recall that 200 – 300 feet were exemplified. Again, as stated in the article, this would vary according to the ocean floor at any given location, the focusing in bays and waterways, etc.  In West Palm though, I believe that unfortunately you be soggy toast.

Look for the precursors. Being ‘aware’ of your own geographical risks is the first step – recognizing that there IS as risk. Subsequent preparedness might involve the basics, like having a plan and/or an evacuation plan. Think about Water, Food, Shelter, Security. Our website and others are filled with all sorts of related preparedness information. Just begin browsing and formulating your own ideas. The fact that you are thinking about it is something that most other people do not – so you’re already one step ahead. Also, be aware that there is a lot of ‘conspiracy’ out there (although some of it is true!), so use common sense and critical thinking to weed through some of the BS.    Reply          david  06/23/2015 12:38 PM       @Aimee – that comet prediction for Sept 2015 is apparently based on one persons nightmare about it happening near him (in Puerto Rico), and massive internet massaging of his “dream”. I can’t see an event in the mid-Atlantic affecting the Pacific NW to any great degree. There may be a theoretical risk to your area from the large fault in the Pacific near the Oregon-California border, but the science(?) of past events like that, every 300 years, describes a 200-300 ft tsunami along the coast close to the fault. Guess for that, you might be interested in knowing what the elevation in your area is?

Although it’s in plain black and white. I’ m in Hollywood,Fl 3 mins from me is Ft. Lauderdale. I see at first this “300” foot tsunami would go less than 10 miles inland but then i see later in your findings Florida would be wiped out. The reason I’ am curious is that a volcano by Africa is very active. No one knows when it will erupt, but when it does the East Coast (entire East Coast) will be hit. I’am the only swimmer in my house hold of 6 adults an 3 children. I’ am concerned.We wouldn’t survive would we? Please shoot me an email as my search for answers will continue.

The turbulence and debris will turn you into very small pieces of fish food right quickly. The only way to survive is to move away from the coast. By the way, A La Palma eruption is over due.    Reply            jerry  07/18/2013 7:35 PM       if you lived on the east coast and had 5 to 6 hours notice would it be better to take a boat and run towards the tsunami and meet it in the open ocean    Reply          Ken Jorgustin  07/18/2013 8:21 PM       That is an excellent question!  In fact, if you had the means (an appropriate sea-worthy boat) and if you feared massive traffic congestion or the inability to escape inland in time, and IF you had adequate warning (BEFORE the tsunami started pulling water out of the shore prior to its onset), then yes, escaping in a boat would be viable. As long as you were offshore a bit (distance depends on the underlying seafloor), the effects will be minimal. The tsunami doesn’t rear up and create the devastating wave until it is closing in on the shore…  These are a lot of “if’s”    Reply            not joking  07/19/2013 9:57 PM       I’m seriously considering a move to maine, and though I love many spots along the coast, my hubs and I are both sincerely concerned about a tsunami, thus my question to you is, would it be safe to say, anything in Maine, to the left of 95 would be good?

I am concerned about the predicted asteroid hit by Ephraim Rodriquez, I think I am in a very safe area above Farmington Maine, but how far inland would a much larger tsunami than 300 ft travel.  Say a 600 to 1000 foot one?  Because if this happens as predicted it would be much larger than 300ft. I am about 74 miles from the coast as the crow flys. My elevation is at 640 feet, but I could quickly be at 1200 feet if I needed to.  Please answer me if possible, as I am doing everything possible to prepare for my family and neighbors.

Thank for a great model Tj    Reply          Ken Jorgustin  07/21/2013 4:50 PM       Yes, I believe you would probably (be underwater). The elevation there is approximately 60 feet above sea level and you appear near a low lying wetlands/waterway that connects directly with the Atlantic. The town itself is about 20 to 25 miles from the Atlantic shoreline, however the proximity to the path of least resistance is very close. With the scenario given in this article, I believe you would be at a fairly high risk to some damage. That is my ‘opinion’.

The reasoning of the question is that after watching some of the survival prepper shows, if some individuals were to have subterranean shelter, that could be made water tight, the amount of available oxygen would be limited and thus there would be the need to open the watertight seals to allow for proper oxygen replenishment depending on the number of individuals within shelter.  What would be the timeline for the recession of the water at the levels shown in the maps?

The most likely major disaster, currently, is financial collapse, in my opinion.  “according to your map, we are doomed. Also I saw a map that this will effect the southeast portion of Tx too. Is this accurate?”  -The map simply illustrates height above sea-level. If a 300′ tsunami is generated from the Canary Island region, I do not believe that it will traverse the state of Florida due to energy loss as it hits the shoreline. As far as Texas and the Gulf, the effects of the tsunami will be greatly reduced because it is mostly blocked by Florida from the East. This would primarily be an east-coast event.

It depends upon more than the elevation and force. While all of that is eminently logical, it also would cause terrible disease from polluted water. There would be not only flooding, but dead folks and livestock. The later would float as debris as well as the flooded animal areas filled with fecal matter. Likewise the sewage of such an event would be completely without mitigation.  Depending upon the time of year, then one could expect terrible issues with not only sanitation but ruined crops, disease spread by pests and insect vectors from such a mammoth event too. Ground water in other nearby regions may be foul and make the area unliveable.  … I once wrote a very long post elsewhere concerning bugging out folks from the East Coast, particularly along the Atlantic Seaboard. There’s a huge number of people who live there. As such, anyone attempting to get away would likely head West and South entirely dependent upon the season in which a collapse occurred. As such, those bugging out would very likely cause a chain reaction of other folks attempting the same thing. It would cascade with bugging out folks innundating the nearby towns as they ran low on fuel and supplies. They’d strip the land of resources. At first the locals would be glad of the newcomers purchasing supplies, food, and motel rooms. Then the locals would realize that the credit/debit cards were worthless and that they’d given away what supplies were locally available.  Think about that. If you live on the East Coast, then bugging inland would likely take you away from all of your supplies and heavy items like water and would result in terrible chaos and violence.  I sure wouldn’t live anywhere close to the East Coast now. I can think of many scenarios in which living there would result in doom in most any kind of collapse event.  Look at the National Drought Monitor map. Wherever once relocates to must have adequate rainfall and clean accessible water for not only drinking but raising crops and livestock. After look at that map and considering the scenario above, that almost immediately knocks out 90% of the Western USA. Why? It is too arid. Sure the population density is very low in some places, but unless you can expect an agricultural future, then there is no future. All of the West has suffered long term drought save a few places. That affects both agriculture but also game animals and fish too. Long term drought leads to terrible losses of soil microbes for nitrogen fixation. That makes it sterile. There is high salinity too.  So with BOTH things in mind, that should tell folks how far away to get from the East Coast, but not too far. I’m not a believer in the Western Redoubt model for this main reason.    Reply          Paul  11/18/2013 8:25 AM       Linden will be fine. Staten Island will take the hit.

Reply          HopefulNotHopeless  11/18/2013 3:26 PM       By the time the decision is made to alert the public to evacuate is given, then the roads will be completely full of much higher than normal congestion. Given a bad economy and the avoidance of routine car maintenance, then one can expect many stalled overheated vehicles among them. As such, many folks may be trapped in traffic.  Meditate upon this. How far could you travel realistically in your vehicle if everyone else is also trying to drive away? By my estimates (I wrote a very long article about this once), at best if your gas tank was 3/4 full (since one cannot always top off a fuel tank), and if there was enormous traffic, and your credit cards/atm cards are not working, and gas station owners are worried themselves about evacuating (so hence no honest possibility of refueling), then one can probably only travel 100-150 miles AT MOST.  There are maps on the Internet that show population density. I urge you to look them up. Since many folks prefer to live in urban areas, as they would be evacuating mostly via interstate highways, then the closer you are to the Eastern Coast, the more the cascades of traffic jams would come into play.  Let’s say one gets away 100-150 miles from their origin point. What then? You are fuelless, low on supplies, and likely have encountered stalled traffic on the highway. People would be panicking and likely armed folks would either be attempting to steal supplies from each other or protect themselves. Would you really wish to be among those folks?  In almost any SHTF scenario, the East Coast is a terrible region to be in. With that kind of population density and without the local agriculture to feed those folks, then there is little chance at long term survival. Under tsunami conditions, well there would be nil chances at survival.

Having said that, a hypothetical tsunami as described, will not go ‘everywhere’ within the elevations that are shown. The shaded-colored coastal areas however, yes, those will certainly be underwater.    Reply            Paul  11/19/2013 10:09 AM       The real threat of a tsunami hitting the East coast and erasing Florida from the map is not a chunk of land breaking from the Canary Islands. The most immediate threat right now (within the next two months) is a string of meteorites that are following comet Ison. Please look it up on youtube and inform yourselves. This comet is not a regular comet. Scientists are puzzled by its formation because it appears to be made up of several segments. When it passes around the sun it could break up into several pieces and no one really knows their trajectory after this. The Earth will be passing through its trajectory and no one knows what it could be dragging because we cannot see what is coming facing the sun. It is very possible that several meteorites will hit our planet and that a larger one could fall near Puerto Rico at an angle that will cause a great tsunami that will hit the East coast of the USA. In addition, no one knows if its passing near the sun will trigger solar flares that will head our way. The sun is about to change its magnetic field and precisely now is when Comet Ison will fly by the sun. We could be without power for several months and I am going to leave it to your imagination as to what can happen if we get hit by a tsunami and there is no power. This scenario can happen in December 2013 or January 2014. Look it up.    Reply          Stepfanie  11/19/2013 4:19 PM       Why the news have not mention any of this?

The meteorites are coming in the direction from the sun, as they are following comet ison. If we look up at the direction of the sun with our telescopes, it is practically impossible to detect anything coming our way. Even the Vatican is in alert pointing their telescopes at the skies. At the most, we will have a twelve hour notice. By then most of the roads and highways will be shut down by the traffic.

Anyone close to the water could have issues with soil erosion, sewage contamination (a frequent issue in hurricane zones), alterations in the salinity of the soil by ocean flooding, hurricane impact, tsunami, etc.  Wouldn’t it be better to sit down and strategically look at that kind of data and pray about it as a couple, then to ask strangers to intervene to determine who is right and who is wrong?  Practically every property from a prepper standpoint has issues with it, be it drought resistance, fertility, tornado zones, earthquake, erosion, hurricane, flooding, too arid, too cold, too hot, etc.  Palm Bay Florida is a very large city of over 100,000 and the most populated zone in your county.

Reply          Ken Jorgustin  11/28/2013 7:33 AM       You would need to define “a wave”. Given this particular article and its scenario, the wave is a massive tsunami, which would certainly travel more than 1 mile inland on much of the east coast of FL which is very flat and only ‘feet’ above sea level… that’s my opinion.    Reply          Paul  12/02/2013 5:21 PM       Michelle, I have bad news for you. The tsunami that we are all waiting to occur will submerge Florida state. In fact, after this tsunami, the map of the territory of the USA will change. Chances are that the tsunami will be generated by a meteor that will fall somewhere near Puerto Rico. Since very few people belive this, most of the population will continue living their liveses as usual.    Reply            Paul  12/02/2013 8:20 AM       News from comet Ison: The comet has broken up into thousands of pieces (big and small) as it went around the sun two days ago due to the extreme heat and pressure. Now its trayectory may change because we are dealing with many objects spreading out and slowing down. We could be getting hit by many meteorites in the last weeks of December or early January of 2014. We could even be hit by a mid size meteor capable of causing a great tsunami.

Instead, by bringing awareness to the subject will hopefully cause some to know about the risk – even though low probability (but with potential high impact). Something like this may never happen at all.  A general recommendation (for anyone) is to get a weather radio (public alert radio) because in addition to weather events, you will be alerted to a tsunami event too.

In Japan 19,000 lives were lost, 1.2 million buildings damaged and the wave was 133 feet.  If we were hit by a 300 foot wave, our cities, road, electrical grid, and building would be destroyed.  People who got out, would not be returning. People who stayed, would have no power, water, food or shelter.  Unlike Sandy and Katrina there would be no rebuilding!

The direction of the wave, and the landscape will determine the effects more than simple elevation.  I also wonder what effect the continental shelf will have..  It may serve as a barrier to mitigate the impact. Escape scenario?  (I live on the East Coast).  Even if we are saved from much of the impact, the devastation caused in surrounding area’s will make the East Coast a house of horrors.  I think I’d rather be taken out in the wave.  There are WAY too many people who will live through the initial wave who will think they can “live off the land”.  Ain’t gonna work. Long pig will end up on the menu.

Quote from the article above, “The maps simply show elevation… not the expected distance a 300 foot tsunami would travel.”  The maps have nothing to do with fluid dynamics and the many other variables which would affect the behavior of a tsunami in any given area. The maps present a glimpse of the raw data – height elevation. No more, no less. It’s a starting point for one’s own analysis.

Reply          suzanne  02/03/2014 11:48 AM       Ken, thank you for providing a “model” of could potentially occur. Irregardless if it is a meteor striking or the direct result of the Canary Island volcanic activity and subsequent earthquakes that cause such a deadly tsunami, it is obviously of vital importance to be well prepared in advance.  Harry has offered some very practical tips on what people should be doing and looking for. Seabirds, in fact, any unusual animal migrations and behaviors are very reliable signs that something bad is about to happen. Prior to the devastating tsunami that hit in the Indian Ocean in 2005, many people reported all sorts of animals were “quickly heading for higher ground” in advance of the tsunami. Pets will also alert their owners by becoming increasingly distressed and panicked; they just “know”. The CB radio would be a necessity for communicating.  Pay attention not only to weather radios, but scanners which monitor activity of first response organizations as they often will get the information in advance of the public. Try not to panic so that you can think clearly and make safe discisions for you and your family. Having plenty of bottled drinking water on hand as part of an emergency package, is also recommended. Emergency nutritonal and high energy food items for the short term can be peanut butter, crackers, raisins and trail mixes, granola bars.  As also mentioned back and secondary roads are usually safer bits for avoiding traffic jams on main highways. But be prepared that in the case of either traffic jams or accidnets, because of the timing of impending danger, you may have to leave your vehicle and travel on foot. So have backpacks with a change of clothes, jackets and medications that you need or might need and also a first aid lit. These items should already be packed and either in your trunk or ready to grab at a moments notice. Make sure you and loved ones and friends are right with God now.

Reply          People are reading too much into this  07/02/2014 4:28 PM       I am an engineer, have done risk studies, and worked on a tsunami inundation sensor network proposal one time.  There is a 100% chance that part of the Canary Islands will collapse and cause a tsunami. People have no idea when that is going to happen, except probably not in the next few weeks, how large, and in what direction the tsunami will be oriented.  I see a lot of people here asking about their specific location and how that would be. As the author points out, these are not inundation charts, these are altitude charts. These show approximately the maximum extent of a tsunami wave, but even that is not exactly true, because moving water can travel uphill, but at the same time, it is bleeding off energy as friction with the surface.  The wave along the east coast of the Americas (N&S) will not be equal. Tsunamis (this kind) are directional, meaning there is a lobe of higher wave height. If that wave is coming right at you, you might see the 100′ monster, but if you are perpendicular to the lobe, maybe only a few feet. How the wave presents itself locally is due to local geography. A narrowing inlet will see higher wave heights than a circular island with a steep base.  The only way to find out about your location is to run actual simulations of various mountain collapse scenarios and see how that sets up the initial conditions, propagate the wave, then model your local geography. You would need to run thousands of simulations to represent the thousands of ways the mountain can collapse. It has been done for some locations.  But the point is, one must not look at the scenarios in the article as real, they are instructional, but are not possible as presented. To prepare, presume one is either in or out of the inundation zone, and if in, how would one get out? Works for hurricanes too.

For those this really interests or concerns, TAKE A GEOLOGY CLASS! Or ten. If you can’t afford a class, find a good course at a good university and get the textbooks, then READ THEM! It seems some could use a basic physics refresher, as well.  Before believing any “prophecies,” find out if your “prophet” predicted the Indian Ocean tsunami, 9-11, or anything of significance, ever. It seems Edgar Cayce predicted the Indian Ocean tsunami, but he also thought Virginia Beach, VA, elevation 12ft, would survive coming “Earth changes.” Believe SCIENCE, not prophets.

Reply          Garry B. Coston  07/28/2014 11:53 PM       I am not an expert on this subject, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that type of event, event happenstance, energy, sea floor topography, and shoreline/land topography all contribute to this play of how fast it travels, how high the wave height will be once it approaches the shoreline, how far inland it travels, and how many lives will be affected and/or lost. The Canary Island scenario, in my opinion, might yield less energy relative to how fast it travels, wave height, how far inland, etc. the tsunami travels, however, a more intense event, like an asteroid, meteor, or other object splashing into the Atlantic would probably garner much more energy, wave height, and moving the tsunami much further inland. I firmly believe that an asteroid or other space object will be the final death knell for the eastern seabord. Just Florida, where I live, will possibly be wiped out either way, but I believe that Florida might fare somewhat better from a Canary Island event. An Asteroid event would garner and produce so much energy, and unbelievable wave heights, that when it the tsunami hits Florida, the land, being that Florida is mostly sand, soft rock, and underground aquifers, will give way and sink as the tsunami continues it assault westward towards the Gulf of Mexico. I could be wrong, but tell me your thoughts please. I do know also that the entire Eastern Seaboard will be severely affected either way but might fare better from a Canary Island event (the water might recede in that instance but with an asteroid event from space, most of the land (i.e. Florida) will probably collapse and sink).

Reply          Coastal Connecticut  03/09/2015 9:56 AM       I have watched just about every Japan 2011 and Asian 2004 tsunami video. Tsunamis are serious business. They hit a coast at full height then eventually reduce height and choose a path of least resistance but in some places double up to great heights like at Minamisanriku were it washed over the tsunami warning center at 50ft above sea level but on the immediate coast.  I can see a Canary Island tsunami funneling directly into the Long Island sound and us not having Long Island for protection. Im near the coast in Ivoryton and we have Bushy Hill Mountain a 1 hr hike away and a few other mountains nearby above 300ft sea level. Ill say just going up a hilly road 300 above sea level would suffice.  Just to let everyone know; that once they do arrive inland to safety, there will be plenty of stores open for food etc if they can get there.  We are mountainous up here in New England and the effects would be mostly immediate coastal and river edges with water funneling in to low resistance areas leaving houses way up high unscathed 10 miles inland.The hills like the breakwaters in Japan (although all breached even the 45 ft fudai tsunami wall at 60ft were the village survived) will lessen the impact.  But this article and watching the footage of people stranded on the hospital roof in Minamisanriku, is going to motivate me to make an emergency backpack for any disaster that may strike. I estimate the cost to be $100 max.  If the canary islands collapse, you’ll have a 5hr notice minimum. Use google earth to look around and find your highest mountain and have a plan and survive off you back pack until you can walk to safety of ride a bike.  The wave that hit Japan was 30 ft high that doubled or channeled up to 100 ft high in certain areas (it wasn’t a 100ft cresting wave). Even if Im at the beach were I work as a ranger, I could walk to a place 300 above sea level in 5 hrs. The key is to have resources to survive at your immediate survival.  The further inland you go, the less height you’ll need to get to provided you don’t end up in an area where the water doubles up due to deflection.

But even with the idea of a tsunami is not as likely as a lot of other threats that are around the pike. But that’s just my feeble opinion for what it’s worth.

Have yourselves and the enemies got nuclear subs ? What happens when one of them has an accident ? What happens when anyone one of the nuts that rule or fight for will hit back with the same ? Things will get high or maybe higher !  Now consider the frequency of earthquakes increasing and the intensity is also on the increase, have you not realized that this is mentioned in the bible, and the fact at the end of the age as we know it today it is predicted a massive earthquake shall come, and it shall shake the whole earth ! how big of a tsunami will this cause, and will the continents break apart ? where will you hide ?

Reply          Jim F  08/03/2015 6:03 AM       Other than this dude in Puerto Rico who had a dream about the asteroid hit is there any evidence at all that this is going to happen ?  The entire story originated from him.    Reply          Jim F  08/05/2015 8:43 AM       I’ve done some more checking into this story.  There is no real evidence that this will occur.  It’s all a bunch of apocalyptic scare nonsense.  Will we get hit by a tsunami sooner or later – yes.  Will we get hit by an asteroid/comet on September 24 – no.  Will there be a tsunami on September 24 – no.  What we will hear though at the end of September is that there was a miscalculation of the date (in the dream that got this whole thing rolling) and the date has now been moved to yada, yada, yada.  Are we in the end times.  Yes, I believe we are but there will be no rapture on September 23 and when the SHTF is anybody’s guess.

Then military all across north America including Canada is on the move to.  Then there was a notice posted on the weather channel not too long ago, stating to expect a tsunami caused by a 9.2 earthquake on the west coast and said it was 75 years over due, One that occurs every 240 years approx. Definitely something is possibly coming and no one is speaking about it, That could mean a real shortage in fossil fuels, and all the more we need an energy this universe runs on, and the only research for that energy one can put their finger on is cmae.ca. While it is a known fact all governments and scientific fields of research have gone a different direction in this field, such as ring proton and neutron, They have floundered with the actual energy we need,    Reply          Jim F  08/05/2015 9:31 AM       I agree that something is up and that something is not going to be nice.

We cannot tell when but it WILL happen. I hope I’m dead by then because for who ever survives will for sure have to deal with the financial difficulties that follow an event like this. An event triggered from a landslide and I created a 1,700 foot wave. That was in a bay though so in the Cumbre Vieja event it would be very different. There is no way to tell how high/ inland a tsunami in this size would be. But 300 feet is a good average    Reply          Jim F  08/05/2015 2:35 PM       I agree it (asteroid hit – tsunami) will happen at some point in time again but it’s not going to be on September 24 because some guy in Puerto Rico had a dream about it.

They are habitable, can support crops in places, and have clear rushing mountain streams. It is no secret that some in the elite have selected these spots as hideaways, have purchased land, often at existing resort sites already setup to house the wealthy, and are prepared to guard their fortresses. Such encampments will soon need a slave labor force, when the supplies run out. Whether still ruled by the wealthy elite who originally purchased them or by their guards, who have little reason to remain loyal to their original masters, the local farming community will be pressed into service, with great brutality.

Reply            BR549  09/18/2015 3:58 PM       Just because a tsunami may reach 100 ft in height does NOT mean that everyone living below that height will need to take SCUBA lessons. It’s far more complex than that. In the same location, I have dived on shipwrecks that, with a four foot surface wave, the lower orbital aspect of the wave only reached 20 or thirty feet below the surface. On one same wreck, at another time, there was a four foot wave on the surface but it its lower orbital aspect was thrashing me back and forth at 110 ft. What that means is that the wave REALLY wanted to be deeper, (probably another 10-20 ft) but its forward movement was impacting the sand and I was caught in the surge.  The latter observance was while hurricane waves were being generated before the actual landfall. The first observance was just normal sized waves for the area with locally generated waves. Still, it is the VOLUME of water under the wave that governs how far a wave will penetrate inland. Speed is a minor factor, since the continental shelf and sloping ocean bottom as a braking surfaces to oncoming waves. How that shows up is that hurricanes waves with a lot greater volume still don’t advance onto the beach much faster than regular waves.  I recall author Willard Bascomb describing one tsunami wave traveling at 400 mph, but since it was only 2 feet high and hundreds of miles between crests, no one on the beach noticed anything unusual. So, since waves are generally slowed down as their lower aspect drags along the ocean bottom, and further braked by trees and buildings, it is far more likely that a 100 ft wave will run out of enough water volume before ever reaching all those house under that 100 ft.  If an asteroid hit the mid-Atlantic, THAT would be a real problem because the volume of displaced water would be off the charts. Although a bit Hollywood, a good way to see how the water behaved was in “Deep Impact” with Elijah Wood and Morgan Freeman. Near the very end, Wood is outrunning the water and you can get an idea of how much momentum the incoming water loses as it encounters the convolution of mountains and valleys.  All I’m saying is that figuring out whose house will get flooded depends on a huge number of factors not the least of which include, volume, speed, frequency, direction. and topographical resistance features. So, the big question to ask is whether the maps drawn relate to merely the height of the wave ……. or take into account the complexities of the previously mentioned factors.  Imagine, if you will, a tsunami wave generated at the Yucatan Peninsula traveling northward to the Gulf shore of the US. That 300 foot wave someone mentioned in an earlier post would never make it to the Ohio River (315 ft elevation) because the wave would have dissipated long before traveling the 1000 miles to the confluence there.    Reply          NRP  09/18/2015 4:11 PM       @ BR549  Agreed, mostly, but a 100′ tsunami wave, 1 mile inland, and 43′ elevation climb in NC where their are usually very few mountain between. Sort of like predicting the earthquake in Tenn. Or the Yellowstone Volcano eruption. Or even worse, the stock markets with obummer’s finger on the Nuke Trigger.

All areas along the Eastern Coast will have to deal with tidal waves as a fact they cannot discount, during the coming pole shift. No wall will be strong enough to resist the weight of water that will rise up, 100 feet high, in a steady flood tide, nor are there walls in place today constructed with that in mind. High rise buildings with doors and windows and sewage connections will do more than flood, on the lower floors, they will crush and drop, as the water will create uneven pressure on outside walls, pressure they were never expected to have to resist. New Jersey does not have the elevation or distance from the coast to assure safety. New Jersey is extreme lowland for almost the entire state. Essentially a delta area, there are no rock outcroppings to afford safety from tidal waves that will strike the coastline at a height of 500-600 feet, diminishing only well inland to an average wash over the state of 100 feet above sea level. Soil will wash from under buildings so that they topple. The land in many places will be scoured clean, without a trace, and in some areas no land will even remain. The land abutting the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, to the extent it rises above that 100 foot level and well away from any river outlets by which the sea can pour inland, will afford some protection from tidal waves.    Reply          BR549  09/21/2015 10:02 PM       Well explained, Steve. I had tried to let people know that just because there is a 500 ft wall of water at the shore does NOT mean that everywhere under 500 ft further inland will be inundated. So many factors come into play here, direction, the moon, the tides, the wind, and importantly, the volume of initial seismically displaced water.  So, your 100 ft flood tide would sound about right, assuming that the water’s mass is able to lose sufficient momentum through convolutions within anyone’s local topography. But no matter how you look at it, New Jersey would be toast.

Reply          Tsunami wave to hit East coast  09/27/2015 10:09 PM       Some years ago I had a dream where I saw myself standing in front of the Atlantic ocean contemplating its grandeur and admiring nature’s beauty. In the dream it was a beautiful day to be out in the ocean. As i observed the deep, I noticed that the ocean started behaving strangely, and a great fear came upon me. The disturbance in the ocean happened so suddenly like in the twinkle of an eye! I saw this enormous dark tidal wave approaching the coast very rapidly and stretching from north to south as far as the eye can see. It was the longest, largest tidal wave I have ever seen.For a moment during the dream I thought I was in the flood during the days of Noah. As the wave reached the coast ascending to its appointed height, the number that came to my consciousness during the vision was 1000ft tall. It stood in front of me and I saw the sun seating upon its crest and I felt as if my spirit melted of terror inside me. I pleaded to God from the depths of my soul for mercy and I asked him to please spare my life from such a great destruction. I wanted to run but I knew it was useless, I could not move because of the fear that overwhelmed my soul and flesh; as I am pleading with desperation in my dream calling upon God begging him to please remove me from such destruction, with great difficulty I returned to my body, and I was paralyzed but with my mind completely aware of the situation. I found myself in a state of being here and there at the same time. It was as if my body was still in front of the wave and my mind was looking to access the physical body without being able to establish the connection, and it took me a while to understand that I was dreaming. When I finally made it back fully to my flesh and realized that I was laying on my bed dreaming, I noticed that my entire body was sweating profusely, it felt like if a fountain had burst from within me and there were drops of sweat literally on my entire flesh. It was a horrible vision, horrible to no end… to this day, I refuse to go near the ocean for fear of the dream. I send an email to the weather channel wanting to know how far inland a wave of this magnitude would go but I have not received a response yet from them. After that dream, I have had other dreams of waves coming upon the earth. Among those one will be on the West coast of the US, but that one, would not be as large as the one that will come upon the East coast. I was told as a child that when a dream repeats itself is to be taken as a warning and the repetition means that it will come to pass. So say for example, if a person is living in New England how far would a wave this huge would go inland? Would it reach as far as the mountains? This year some months ago, I had a different dream, and in my dream I saw myself suspended in the air where the clouds dwell and I was standing there looking up, but I did not know why was I there and what was I trying to look at. From the middle of the clouds I was looking at, there appeared a clearing see thru, resembling a fine dew made of clouds but looking like see thru dew. While I was looking to the clearing on the clouds, a man of a gigantic stature appeared on my left and he was wearing a long white tunic, but with his face in the cosmos. I was not allowed to see his face but around where the face should be all I saw was the cosmos. After this, I was caused to lower my body downward but still in a standing up position (travelling straight down effortlessly)  and I came below the man’s feet where I noticed the lower legs and sandals he was wearing. As I descended I saw the hem of his garment and I wondered what was the vision about and the meaning of it, when I heard a voice saying: “Prepare to leave” and after I heard the voice saying that the dream ended. Could someone that is familiar on how to calculate the wave’s radius inland tell me that information?    Reply          Ms. T  10/26/2015 4:16 PM       Your dreams I am sure were so intense.  I truly believe God is speaking to a lot of people in dreams.  I  wish I could help you with your question.  I think when it does happen all we can do is look to Him!    Reply          Lauren  01/24/2016 12:59 AM       The distance inland depends on the depth (not the height) of the wave, the reason behind it, and the terrain of the land. Without knowing those three criteria it would be impossible to predict. The wave extends to the ocean bottom, so as it approaches the shore it grows in height. It will only achieve its “true” height when it hits the shore. However, once the wave hits the shore it no longer has the push of the ocean behind it so it starts to lose power. Even a 1000 foot wave might dissipate quickly.

The isles can be really high as they are mostly vulcanic but still very small in diameter… And as knowing that a tsunami gains speed with distance how big and how far would it hit there? As far as i know there were never in the known history any tsunami catastrophe there… only the ocasional earthquakes.

The northern and southern coasts would be quite different. Southern coast tent to be shelving whereas north of Massachusetts the coast is very abrupt, over 100 ft within a quarter mile of the coast (sometimes just yards).  The though on within a quarter mile of the Exeter River, like many northern rivers it is small an tortuous. Even the river is more than  100 ft above sea level here, and there are land rifts of over 100 ft. between here and the coast which would adsorb a lot of energy. Though only 15 mi from the coast the bulk of the water would have to travel 25 or 30 mi, or surmount large obstacles. Topography is paramount. Water intersecting water absorbs energy.

GOOD-LUCK…    Reply          Anonymous  11/21/2015 6:54 PM       Anonymous Some years back I dreamt of an enourmous earthquake in the early morn causing a violent volcanoe eruption. Everyone was running & fleaing for their lives heading upward to the mountains. I was among them terrified for my life only caring if I alone survived. Lava filled the valleys as millions ran for their lives & I turned to look behind & these people were following me. I yelled I can’t save you! I looked around the terrain & even though I had never been there I knew this was Hawaii or one of its islands. We were trapped & could only go upward. The day became night from the ash & the valleys raised with lava. When we reached the summit of the peak & awaited our fate. I remembered that morning I had been visited by a messenger who had given me a message to read at precisely at 2pm. I asked someone the time & was told it was 2 o’clock. I took the piece of paper out & read it. The only thing I will say is: GOD DEVISED a plan to save the people on that island because I believed the message & 1 man gave all his efforts we worked together. Near the end we weren’t sure everyone would get off. When it came to the last group one had to remain behind & this man told me to go.with great love & admiration I pushed him  & said you go I’m ok. & I was. As afraid as I was of dying & the lava. This man saved the people & he showed me how to care for someone other than myself. There is no doubt in my mind this was Hawaii. I don’t understand the dream but Hawaii is Hawaii & at some point it is destroyed. Rather in this quake or in a future event it’s gone.

This location is 11 mi from the atlantic ocean, but only 5 mi south of the sandy hook bay, west of the Atlantic & east of the raritan bay just south east of Staten Island. Would I be safe just heading to this spot instead of hopping on a westerly interstate that’s most likely packed with other evacuees?

Like the other person mentioned, todt hill is an option, but you would pretty much be on a tiny island until the water clears out. And lots of other people would come to todt, so it would be pretty crowded. And the catskills are an option but they will take a while to get to.

While a massive tsunami of this magnitude would travel up rivers and waterways to an extent, and push inland to an extent, it will lose it’s energy fairly rapidly as it travels inland.  There have been lots of people who have commented on this article who live well inland and have been concerned about impact. If you are many miles away from the shoreline, and depending on geography an terrain, chances are you may be okay.  The main reason that I posted this article had to do with the fact that LOTS and LOTS of people live very near the shoreline. And “if” this tsunami were to take place, these people and their property would be devastated.

Tsunamis don’t maintain their height.  A tsunami wave crests near the shore line. After collapse, it would pile up the water and push the water inland. A 10 meter tsunami goes 1.2 kilometers inland. One guess for 30 meter tsunami  is it would go generally 20 miles inland on near sea level land. If your on a river connected to where tsunami hit, a wave will surge up that river so don’t be near any connected rivers.

(National Weather Service)  By Leigh Morgan     Think the Gulf Coast is safe from tsunamis? Not so fast.   Why all the #TsunamiPrep info this week? Contrary to popular belief, Gulf Coast is NOT immune from a tsunami (more rare than other coasts) -- NWS Mobile (@NWSMobile) March 24, 2015    It's Tsunami Preparedness Week , and National Weather Service offices nationwide -- including those along the Gulf Coast -- are raising awareness and offering safety tips in case one comes your way.  A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves usually caused by a major earthquake on the sea floor, a landslide or volcanic activity. They can strike any ocean shoreline at any time, but are most common in the Pacific.  While tsunamis in the Gulf of Mexico are rare, the Gulf states were added to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System in 2005.  Texas A&M University at Galveston has been researching the threat of a tsunami in the Gulf. According to their research, the greatest risk of a Gulf tsunami comes from underwater landslides or earthquakes.  The chance of a tsunami forming outside of the Gulf and then striking local coastlines appears small.  How an underwater earthquake can cause a tsunami. (NOAA)  According to the university, a massive underwater landslide poses the greatest risk for a tsunami for the Gulf Coast, but the probability of that happening is low.  The Texas A&M University at Galveston Tsunami Research Group has developed a 3D numerical model for what could happen after a submarine landslide. The 3D model is combined with a 2D model to depict how a tsunami could affect coastal areas.  See a simulation of a tsunami in the Gulf here .  Researchers are planning a study in Mobile and four other Gulf Coast locations to determine how vulnerable they will be. The other sites are Panama City and Texas' South Padre Island, Freeport and Galveston.  According to NOAA, each year there are approximately two tsunamis that cause damage near their source. Destructive, ocean-wide tsunamis like the one in 2004 that struck near Indonesia and killed more than 230,000 people are more infrequent.  A few other things about tsunamis:  *According to NOAA, low-lying coastal areas such as beaches, bays, lagoons, harbors and river mouths and areas along rivers and streams that lead to the ocean are at greatest risk. Tsunami waves can wrap around headlands and islands, so coasts facing away from the tsunami source may also be at risk.  *Like earthquakes, tsunamis can happen at any time of the day or night, during any kind of weather and in all seasons.  *Even small tsunamis can be dangerous. Strong currents can injure and drown swimmers and damage and destroy boats in harbors.  *A tsunami is not surfable. Tsunami waves are not like wind waves. They do not have a face, do not curl and break like wind waves and are full of dangerous debris.  *It only takes 6 inches of fast-moving water to knock over an adult and 2 feet of fast-moving water to carry away most vehicles.  *The water can be just as dangerous (if not more so) as it returns to the sea, taking debris and people with it.  *The warning signs of a tsunami are: A strong earthquake felt in a coastal area, a rapid rise or fall in coastal waters or a loud roaring sound coming from the ocean.  *A tsunami is not just one wave, but a series of them that could last for hours. And the first wave is not always the largest.  Find more information on tsunamis and how to prepare and stay safe here .

A new study from the University of Miami found that South Florida faces a small but real risk of tsunamis generated by landslides on the undersea slopes west of the Bahamas. Such landslides have occurred in the distant past, presumably causing tsunamis then, and they are likely to occur again, according to the study published in the journal Scientific Reports. In the worst-case scenario, the largest possible quantity of mud and sand would plunge to the ocean floor from Great Bahama Bank, displacing enough water to slam South Florida with a 15-foot tsunami. While a wave of that height may not sound impressive, it represents something far more powerful than an ordinary 15-foot wave, since a tsunami is a wall of water that carries a vast amount of water behind it. But there's no reason to flee to higher ground yet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rates the tsunami risk for the east coast of Florida as low, compared to "very low" for the Gulf coast and "high to very high" for the Pacific coast. The authors of the study say there's no reason to revise that assessment.  "We're still low risk," said Jara Schnyder, lead author of the study and a graduate student at UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. She said the frequency of such events could be measured in the hundreds of thousands of years.       "Even if we have an earthquake that might trigger this, it would have to trigger a landslide with a big enough mass and fast enough propagation to generate a tsunami. That's why we call these low-probability but high- impact events." Working with her were other scientists from UM, as well as scientists from the University of Delaware, Université de Bordeaux in France and University of Bremen in Germany.  In the most likely scenario, an earthquake off the Cuban coast would generate the landslide, although landslides could also occur spontaneously. Gregor Eberli, professor of marine geosciences at UM and senior author of the study, said it would take a powerful earthquake, one scoring 5.5 on the Richter scale or higher, to generate a big enough landslide to cause a tsunami, and those are rare. The area at risk would depend on the location of the landslide. The study looked at Great Bahama Bank, one of the geologic platforms that supports the islands of the Bahamas. If the landslide took place there, the area at risk would range from Cuba to the Keys to Miami Beach. If the landslide took place at the Little Bahama Bank, the at-risk area would extend up the Florida coast to southern St. Lucie County, Eberli said. And there are scenarios that fall short of the worst-case. The size of the tsunami would depend on the amount and velocity of the mud and sand sliding to the ocean floor. At best, it might be barely noticeable or generate severe rip currents. Other scenarios call for significant tsunamis, but ones smaller than a house-smashing 15-footer. Facing far more devastation would be Cuba. The worst-case for that island would be a tsunami reaching a catastrophic 31feet. Tsunamis are most common in the Pacific Ocean, where continental plate boundaries that rim the Pacific generate the string of volcanoes and earthquake zones known as the Ring of Fire. But while earthquake-generated tsunamis are the most common, there have been tsunamis in which undersea landslides, often caused by earthquakes, played the largest role in generating the giant waves. A rare Atlantic tsunami took place in 1929, when an earthquake off Newfoundland created an undersea landslide that caused a tsunami that killed more than two dozen people. In the Pacific, a 1998 earthquake caused an undersea landslide that generated a 23-foot tsunami that destroyed coastal villages and killed more than 2,000 people. Eberli said a tsunami hitting Florida would be unlikely to be that devastating, although he said it could be a cause of concern for the Turkey Point nuclear power plant. "The tsunami risk is not great enough to make damage like what they have in Japan," he said. "It could be quite devastating for coastal buildings. But it will not be like tens of thousands of people will drown. It's not that kind of event." dfleshler@sun-sentinel.com , 954-356-4535      2017 could bring active hurricane season, report says   Idle Heat can clinch division tonight; Cavs possibility could be removed   Two gay men attacked, beaten after Gay Pride Parade, Miami Beach cops say      Copyright

March 11, 2011 at 5:31 pm       Filed Under: Bart Hagemeyer , Canary Islands , Could A Tsunami Affect Florida , Earthquake , Florida , Michael Williams , National Weather Service , NOAA , South Florida , Tsunami    (CBS4)  MIAMI (CBS4) – South Floridians know how to prepare for a disaster, after all, we’ve got hurricane season year after year. But in the wake of the devastating earthquake and massive tsunami in Japan, many people are wondering whether a tsunami could strike Florida.  While we’d like the answer to be ‘no chance’ at all, it’s not that simple. There is actually a “very remote chance” a tsunami could hit the Sunshine State. The good news? Most tsunamis are associated with major earthquakes which makes the possibility of a tsunami hitting Florida’s East Coast very small.  The Atlantic Ocean basin does not have large faults like the Pacific, which are associated both with earthquakes and tsunamis. It is thought that rare underwater landslides would pose a greater risk in the Atlantic Ocean.  While the Caribbean region does have a history of both earthquakes and tsunamis, they have not impacted Florida’s coastlines.  Regardless, the Weather Service and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have a warning system in place, which includes a network of buoys in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and have encouraged several communities along the nation’s East Coast to enroll in the Tsunami Ready program.  The two in the program in Florida are Indian Harbour Beach in Brevard County and Naval Station Mayport near Jacksonville.  Although many people envision a tsunami as one gigantic wall of water, it’s actually a series of powerful fast-moving waves that can suddenly inundate a shoreline. A tsunami can travel at speeds of 500 to 600 mph. A major tsunami will cross an entire ocean before it slows and rises in a towering wall of water.  Such catastrophic waves are unlikely but not impossible for Florida and the nation’s East Coast, according to tsunami researchers, while Caribbean island dwellers have more reason to be wary.  Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake.  The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea.  That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “mega-tsunami,” according to Hagemeyer.  Still, Florida has one big factor in its favor. The shallow waters off Florida’s coasts will act as a breakwater, dissipating a tsunami’s energy.

Bahamas Top Stories    2004-12-30 09:39:25  Slim Possibility Of Tsunamis In Bahamas  In the event of a sizable tsunami there would be no recourse for The Bahamas. The Bahamas would experience total destruction at a level never witnessed here before.   With the death toll from the weekend tsunamis in Asia topping 55,000, many island nations, like The Bahamas, have been left to wonder whether such an occurrence could happen elsewhere.  Carl Smith, director of the National Emergency Management Agency, admitted yesterday that The Bahamas government is interested in knowing whether such a natural disaster could ever be possible in this region.  Robert Weisberg, professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida, said in a Florida press report yesterday that Florida's greatest risk for tsunami occurrence emanates from the Puerto Trench, however island masses' like The Bahamas lay directly in its path.  If something did happen in the Caribbean, there are things in the way  The Bahamas. The effects we'd feel would be tempered by the fact that we have other land masses in the way,' he told news-press.com.  But he indicated that such an occurrence is highly unlikely.  Although The Bahamas is located in a benign region with respect to tsunamis, earthquakes do happen in the Caribbean Sea.  Tsunami, which is Japanese for harbor wave, are caused by undersea tectonic activity triggered by earthquakes, submarine volcanic eruptions, and submarine landslides.  Dr. Margaret Wiggins-Grandison, seismologist and head of the Earthquake Unit at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, told the Bahama Journal yesterday that it is possible for The Bahamas to experience a tsunami, but the likelihood is not that great.  An island in the Pacific would have a greater probability of impact because of the nature of the continental boundaries in the Atlantic when it is compared to the continental boundaries in the Pacific,' she said.  In 1755 there was a massive earthquake off the coast of Portugal and a tsunami reached as far as the Caribbean.  However, the tsunami was not as devastating upon arrival in the Caribbean. Barbados experienced waves as high as four feet,' Dr. Wiggins-Grandison said.  She explained that earthquakes are the primary triggers, generating the largest tsunamis.  This is because displacement of the sea floor vertically occurs with great force during earthquakes,' Dr. Wiggins-Grandison said.  She said in the event of a sizable tsunami there would be no recourse for The Bahamas. This is because many Bahamian islands are just above sea level with no mountains or high ground to escape, she said.  Dr. Wiggins-Grandison added that The Bahamas would experience total destruction at a level never witnessed here before.  It would no doubt catch Bahamians by surprise as it did hundreds of thousands of people in Asia and parts of Africa.  Ravi Jesubatham, a native of Sri Lanka who lives in The Bahamas, said that tsunamis were unheard off in Sri Lanka because the country usually experiences only natural disasters like small mudslides.  I was surprised at first mention of this disaster because in Sri Lanka we do not get earthquakes, tornadoes or hurricanes  in fact we do not experience any large scale natural disaster,' he said.  I have not heard of any losses in my family, only injuries like my cousin, her husband, and son were injured badly while attending a weeding. In my opinion there are two major concerns in Sri Lanka which include the health of the people who are unaware of how to handle natural disasters, and what effects the tsunami will have on the recently rebounding tourism sector in Sri Lanka.'  Mr. Jesubatham reminded Bahamians that a small contribution from a small island nation would go a long way in Sri Lanka because of the difference in currency. He said that Bahamians should be mindful that natural disasters can occur anywhere at anytime without warning.

Warner Bros. Pictures via YouTube        Share     Share     Tweet               Comment     Email     Print        A new study calls attention to the tsunami hazard posed by a little-understood jumble of seafloor faults off the coast of Southern California — just in time to ride the wave of hype generated by the big-budget disaster movie "San Andreas."  The study's lead author, geologist Mark Legg, says a real-life offshore earthquake and tsunami wouldn't exactly follow Hollywood's script for a washout of Los Angeles or San Diego. Nevertheless, he says the hazard deserves more attention than it's received.  "That has not been looked at carefully when it comes to the potential for large earthquakes and tsunamis from offshore faults," Legg, who runs a Southern California consulting firm called Legg Geophysical , told NBC News.    advertisement            Play                 Facebook    Twitter    Embed      What would happen if a tsunami hit California?  2:06   autoplay  autoplay     Copy this code to your website or blog         Other earthquake experts insist the hazard has been looked at, but they acknowledge that the offshore faults are worthy of further study. "It's a complicated picture, and this is an important piece of it," said Lucy Jones, science adviser for risk reduction in the U.S. Geological Survey's Natural Hazards Mission Area.  Legg's latest research paper, accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface , looks at a mostly underwater seismic region known as the California Continental Borderland. He said surveys of the region show a "complicated logjam" of faults caused by the smash-up of the Pacific tectonic plate and the North American plate.  The research draws upon mapping data from a depth survey in 2010 that covered more than 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) of fault lines on the ocean floor, plus data from earlier surveys. Legg and his colleagues focused on two fault zones in the Borderland — the Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge Fault and the Ferrelo Fault.  Based on their measurements, the researchers determined that the seafloor crust in those areas was subject to horizontal strike-slip forces as well as vertical compression. Computer models showed that the offshore faults were capable of generating magnitude-8 earthquakes.  Legg said earlier underwater surveys found evidence of vertical movement along faults in the Borderland, amounting to as much as 10 feet (3 meters) — the kind of movement that can generate tsunami waves. "There's a smoking gun," Legg said.         This map shows the California Continental Borderland and its major tectonic features, as well as the locations of earthquakes greater than magnitude 5.5. The dashed box shows the area of the new study. Large arrows show relative plate motion for the Pacific-North America fault boundary.  AGU     Related:  California Tsunami Would Have Costly Aftermath   What kind of tsunami?  Jones said there's been evidence that tsunami waves have hit Southern California going back to 1812, when a huge wave apparently generated by a 7.2 quake in the Santa Barbara Channel pushed a 283-ton trading ship a half-mile inland and then pulled it back out to sea. (The ship survived the ordeal.)    advertisement     But anytime someone mentions the word "tsunami," people think of the 2004 quake and tsunami that devastated Sumatra and other Indian Ocean coastal areas, or the giant waves that hit Japan in 2011 . Those tsunami waves were generated in subduction zones, where one tectonic plate dives beneath another. Jones said the "transpression" faults that are the focus of Legg's research wouldn't produce such dramatic results.  "It's not that it's not a risk," Jones said. "It's just not as big a risk as the ones we see from the big subduction zones. "  The zone that's closest to Southern California is the Cascadia subduction zone, which lies off the coast of Northern California, Oregon and Washington state. A Cascadia quake in the year 1700 produced a tsunami so big that it caused damage on Japan's Pacific coast .  Legg agreed that a Borderland tsunami might not be on the scale of a Cascadia tsunami, or the Sumatra tsunami — or the "San Andreas" tsunami, for that matter.  "It doesn't have to be a Sumatra-sized tsunami," he told NBC News. "It could be a 1- or 2-meter surge. That could have a huge impact on the ports."        Related:  'San Andreas' fact and fiction from Earthquake Country   Don't panic, but be prepared  The way Legg sees it, there are two big takeaways. The first one is: Don't panic, but be prepared.  "Worrying doesn't do anyone any good," he said. "Preparedness is the key." For example, if you're on the beach and see the ocean receding dramatically, run to higher ground — because a big tsunami wave is probably on its way.    advertisement     The other takeaway is that undersea faults need to be studied more closely. He pointed out that the federal government had funded seafloor depth mapping, also known as bathymetry, for Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal waters — but the funding was cut before a Pacific coastal survey could be completed.  That has forced researchers to assemble a patchwork picture of Southern California's offshore faults. Legg would like to see more resources devoted to mapping the seafloor, preferably before the big waves roll in.  "This is not a billion-dollar job. Probably for a few million dollars you could finish the California Borderland," he said. "We have excellent maps of Mars and Mercury — and now they're talking about high-resolution imagery of Pluto. But we still don't have high-resolution bathymetry of our own backyard."   In addition to Legg, the authors of "High-Resolution Mapping of Two Large-Scale Transpressional Fault Zones in the California Continental Borderland: Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge and Ferrelo Faults" include Monica Kohler, Tatsumi Shintaku and Dayanthie Weeraratne. The research is the focus of a news release from the American Geophysical Union , which publishes the Journal of Geophysical Research.

A tsunami (pronounced "soo-nahm'ee") is a series of waves generated by an undersea disturbance such as an earthquake. From the area of the disturbance, the waves will travel outward in all directions, much like the ripples caused by throwing a rock into a pond. The time between wave crests may be from 5 to 90 minutes, and the wave speed in the open ocean may be more than 450 miles per hour. Tsunamis have reached heights of more than 100 feet. As the waves approach shallow coastal waters, they appear normal and the speed decreases. Then as the tsunami nears the coastline, it may grow to great height and smash into the shore, causing great destruction and loss of life.   Tsunamis are caused by an underwater disturbance - usually an undersea earthquake. Landslides, volcanic eruptions, and even meteorites can also generate a tsunami.  Tsunamis can originate hundreds or even thousands of miles away from coastal areas. Local geography may intensify the effect of a tsunami. Areas at greatest risk are less than 50 feet above sea level and within one mile of the shoreline.  People who are near the seashore during a strong earthquake should listen to a radio for a tsunami warning and be ready to evacuate at once to higher ground.  Rapid changes in the water level are an indication of an approaching tsunami.  Tsunamis arrive as a series of successive "crests" (high water levels) and "troughs" (low water levels). These successive crests and troughs can occur anywhere from 5 to 90 minutes apart. They usually occur 10 to 45 minutes apart.   What is the Tsunami Risk to the Gulf of Mexico? Tsunamis have occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1991, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Costa Rica produced a six foot high tsunami that flooded nearly 1,000 feet inland on the Caribbean side of the country. The Caribbean also has a number of active submarine volcanoes and fault systems that are capable of producing earthquakes large enough to generate tsunamis. The Gulf is also at risk from very large tsunamis that originate in the Atlantic Ocean, like the one produced by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. There are no authoritative estimates of the extent of the risk that these hazards may pose to states with coastlines on the Gulf of Mexico.  Warning of a Tsunami Threat There is presently no dedicated tsunami warning system for the Gulf of Mexico, but government agencies can be expected to disseminate warnings of potential threats caused by seismic and volcanic events through the Emergency Alert System and the news media. The U.S. Pacific tsunami detection and warning system is in the process of
being expanded to include the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and areas of the Atlantic that could affect the U.S. coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will deploy 32 new tsunami detection buoys for a more extensive tsunami warning system by mid-2007.  Tsunami Preparedness & Response Actions If you live, work, or are visiting in a coastal area and are advised that a threat of tsunami exists:   Listen to a radio or television to get the latest emergency information, and be ready to evacuate if asked to do so. Keep your family members nearby, so you can evacuate as a group.  Ready your vehicle for a trip, so you do not have to stop to get gas or provisions and, if you have a family emergency supplies kit, put it in the car.  Determine which evacuation route you would use if you have to leave and, if possible, also select an alternate route.  Stay away from the beach. Never go to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave, you are probably too close to escape it.  If you are at the beach, be aware that a noticeable rapid rise or fall in coastal waters is also a sign that a tsunami is approaching. If this occurs, consider this a warning, leave at once, and move inland.   If you are advised by local officials to evacuate:   Move at once to higher ground inland, preferably a place that is significantly higher than the surrounding terrain. Go inland -- do not drive on roads that parallel the coast.  Remain at an inland location until authorities advise it is safe to return.  Remember that a tsunami is a series of waves. Do not assume that because one wave has come ashore that the danger over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.

More    CBS Entertainment              Could A Tsunami Hit South Florida?    March 11, 2011 at 5:31 pm       Filed Under: Bart Hagemeyer , Canary Islands , Could A Tsunami Affect Florida , Earthquake , Florida , Michael Williams , National Weather Service , NOAA , South Florida , Tsunami    (CBS4)  MIAMI (CBS4) – South Floridians know how to prepare for a disaster, after all, we’ve got hurricane season year after year. But in the wake of the devastating earthquake and massive tsunami in Japan, many people are wondering whether a tsunami could strike Florida.  While we’d like the answer to be ‘no chance’ at all, it’s not that simple. There is actually a “very remote chance” a tsunami could hit the Sunshine State. The good news? Most tsunamis are associated with major earthquakes which makes the possibility of a tsunami hitting Florida’s East Coast very small.  The Atlantic Ocean basin does not have large faults like the Pacific, which are associated both with earthquakes and tsunamis. It is thought that rare underwater landslides would pose a greater risk in the Atlantic Ocean.  While the Caribbean region does have a history of both earthquakes and tsunamis, they have not impacted Florida’s coastlines.  Regardless, the Weather Service and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have a warning system in place, which includes a network of buoys in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and have encouraged several communities along the nation’s East Coast to enroll in the Tsunami Ready program.  The two in the program in Florida are Indian Harbour Beach in Brevard County and Naval Station Mayport near Jacksonville.  Although many people envision a tsunami as one gigantic wall of water, it’s actually a series of powerful fast-moving waves that can suddenly inundate a shoreline. A tsunami can travel at speeds of 500 to 600 mph. A major tsunami will cross an entire ocean before it slows and rises in a towering wall of water.  Such catastrophic waves are unlikely but not impossible for Florida and the nation’s East Coast, according to tsunami researchers, while Caribbean island dwellers have more reason to be wary.  Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake.  The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea.  That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “mega-tsunami,” according to Hagemeyer.  Still, Florida has one big factor in its favor. The shallow waters off Florida’s coasts will act as a breakwater, dissipating a tsunami’s energy.

March 24, 2014 June 4, 2016  by Michael Snyder     332 1 0 0  Can you imagine the devastation that would be caused if a massive wall of water several hundred feet high slammed into Florida at more than 100 miles an hour?  To many people such a scenario is impossible, but that is what people living along the Indian Ocean thought before the 2004 tsunami and that is what people living in Japan thought before the 2011 tsunami.  Throughout history, giant tsunamis have been relatively rare events, but they do happen.  Scientists tell us that a mega-tsunami can race across the open ocean at up to 500 miles an hour, and when they reach shore they can produce waves that are hundreds of feet high.  And even though authorities claim that the threat to Florida is “remote”, it might surprise you to learn that there are “ Tsunami Hazard Zone ” signs on Florida beaches.  If a highly unusual event (such as a giant meteor hitting the Atlantic Ocean) caused a giant tsunami that hit Florida, the devastation would be absolutely unimaginable.  Most people don’t realize this, but almost the entire bottom half of Florida is just barely above sea level.  If a giant tsunami did hit Florida, there would be nothing to stop it from sweeping across the entire state…  South Florida has two big problems. The first is its remarkably flat topography. Half the area that surrounds Miami is less than five feet above sea level . Its highest natural elevation, a limestone ridge that runs from Palm Beach to just south of the city, averages a scant 12 feet. With just three feet of sea-level rise, more than a third of southern Florida will vanish; at six feet, more than half will be gone; if the seas rise 12 feet, South Florida will be little more than an isolated archipelago surrounded by abandoned buildings and crumbling overpasses. And the waters won’t just come in from the east – because the region is so flat, rising seas will come in nearly as fast from the west too, through the Everglades.  Even worse, South Florida sits above a vast and porous limestone plateau. “Imagine Swiss cheese, and you’ll have a pretty good idea what the rock under southern Florida looks like,” says Glenn Landers, a senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This means water moves around easily – it seeps into yards at high tide, bubbles up on golf courses, flows through underground caverns, corrodes building foundations from below. “Conventional sea walls and barriers are not effective here,” says Robert Daoust, an ecologist at ARCADIS, a Dutch firm that specializes in engineering solutions to rising seas.  Of course the authorities do all that they can to play down this potential threat.  They say that it is “highly unlikely” that a tsunami will ever hit Florida.  The following comes from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection …  Although it is highly unlikely that a tsunami will impact Florida, it is not impossible. Floridians may also travel to locations where tsunamis are more likely. It is vital to know (and instruct children) that if the ocean suddenly recedes from the shore do not stand and stare. It is necessary immediately to run uphill or away from the shore and go to the highest location possible which may mean up the stairs of a substantial building. Everyone should be aware that no matter where in the world they are, if the sea is observed to recede from the shore, they should immediately run for high ground.  That last part is quite funny.  There is no “high ground” until you get to north Florida.  If a mega-tsunami strikes, there is going to be no place to hide.  And large tsunamis do happen in the Atlantic Ocean from time to time.  For example, National Geographic says that there have been 37 verified tsunamis in the Caribbean since 1498…  The Caribbean has been hit by 37 verified tsunamis since 1498. Some were generated locally and others were the result of events far away, such as the earthquake near Portugal.  In recent years, there have been some scientists that have been concerned about what would happen if there was a major earthquake in the Caribbean region or a volcanic eruption in the Canary Islands.  The following comes from CBS News …  Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake.  The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea.  That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “ mega-tsunami ,” according to Hagemeyer.  So what would such a “mega-tsunami” look like?  Well, according to Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Ward, it could produce a wall of water approximately 164 feet high …  Dr Day, working in conjunction with Dr Steven Ward of the University of California, has now produced an updated model that predicts more accurately the size of the tsunami and the areas it will impact.  The model predicts that after the landslide the tsunami would travel a distance of almost 155 miles in just 10 minutes and would reach the Caribbean and Florida in eight or nine hours.  The forecast goes on to predict that a wall of water 164ft high could smash into the coasts of the Caribbean and Florida, while Brazil’s northern coast could be hit by a wave more than 130ft high.  Personally, however, I am convinced that the much greater potential threat comes from above.  According to the University of California at Santa Cruz website , if a massive asteroid were to crash into the Atlantic Ocean it could produce a giant tsunami with a wall of water as high as 400 feet that would slam into the east coast of the United States…  If an asteroid crashes into the Earth, it is likely to splash down somewhere in the oceans that cover 70 percent of the planet’s surface. Huge tsunami waves, spreading out from the impact site like the ripples from a rock tossed into a pond, would inundate heavily populated coastal areas. A computer simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the Atlantic Coast of the United States.  In case you were wondering, yes, that would be absolutely catastrophic.  Major U.S. cities stretching from the tip of Florida all the way up to Maine would essentially be destroyed.  The following is an excerpt from an article posted on Modern Survival Blog …  300 foot tsunami would be the probable devastation of the following major East Coast cities…  Portland, ME (~ 50′) Boston, MA (~ 30′) New Haven, CT (~ 50′) Bridgeport, CT (~ 40′) New York City, NY (~ 20′) Jersey City, NJ (~ 30′) Newark, NJ (~ 50′) Atlantic City, NJ (~ 10′) Wilmington, DE (~ 80′) Philadelphia, PA (~ 40′) Virginia Beach, VA (~ 10′) Wilmington, NC (~ 20′) Myrtle Beach, SC (~ 20′) Charleston, SC (~ 10′) Savannah, GA (~ 10′) Daytona Beach, FL (less than 10′) West Palm Beach, FL (less than 10′) Fort Lauderdale, FL (less than 10′) Miami, FL (less than 10′)  There are countless cities in between these coastal cities. The Eastern Seaboard of the United States includes some of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Over one third of the country (more than 100 million people) live along the East Coast. Evacuation would be virtually impossible for most (except for the astute who act quickly) due to only hours notice, probable doubt, and the subsequent immediate gridlock that would follow.  Most scientists would tell you that the possibility of such a thing is extremely small.  But could it be possible that they are wrong?  At this point, more than 10,000 major near earth objects have been discovered, and about 10 percent of them are one kilometer or larger in size.  And there are many more out there that are still undiscovered.  In fact, scientists are discovering new ones all the time.  Sometimes, astronomers only spot them after they have passed our planet.  What is even more alarming is that the number of “fireball events” that are being recorded appears to be greatly increasing.  Just check out this chart from the American Meteor Society …   So why is this happening?  Why are so many large rocks suddenly flying by so close to our planet?  Has something fundamentally changed?  And what is going to happen when a really giant rock slams into us one day?

The article leaves out that the island housing the Cumbre Vieja Volcano was built by the extinct volcano of the north end of the island and the active Cumbre Vieja of the southern end of the island. It built itself as a Stratavolcano more on par to Anuk Krakatau/Krakatoa than the Shield volcanoes like Hawaii. 2). The article also leaves out that the risk of flank collapse is derived by an eruption a few years ago destabilized the western flank and starting a rift through the center of the island priming the western flank to be pushed into the Atlantic with a major eruption.  Cumbre Vieja flank collapse is primed; it just needs the catalyst.        raptor45     Not a problem…..water          2Gary2     I think this would put out the lake of fire.        Hammerstrike     youtube.c om/watch?v=yDqwlAU2QYs          Miss M     Did you know that dozens of people are having dreams about a tsunami?  The most interesting part of these dreams is most of them have them around 2am, and they report the waves to be hundreds of feet high, unlike other tsunami’s.  Check out the videos, and comments of people having dreams about the EAST COAST, FLORIDA, and CALIFORNIA…  It is really interesting that so many people are seeing the same thing. http://whygodreallyexists.com/archives/dividing-israels-land-judgement-for-the-united-states-visions        Hammerstrike     Jormungandr is stirring.        Rose     That is true. I have been dreaming of huge tsunamis coming for about 20 years now. In the last tsunami dream I was on different shorelines and saw the wave coming in. In some places the waves were so tall the swept over the tops of hotels and in other places the wave was not quite as tall but devastating just the same. In these dreams I am never harmed but I can see everything. The water literally goes over my head and I am under the water. Of course these dreams could be literal or a metaphor for judgements to come. On 9/11 I heard the clock start ticking and I have been prepping ever since.        Hey Mr Fantasy     Does anyone say anything about the Northern Gulf Coast of FL?  The Forgotten/Emerald Coast?          Oldphartbsa     The one to fear, and is most likely, is the avalanche from the Canary Islands.  The volcano is on the edge of a huge rock formation that is poised to break off and slide into the Atlantic.  From what I’ve read, the tsunami coming from that will exceed 600 feet in height and, hopefully, wipe out Washington DC.        corners     if its large enough to wipe our our crooked politicians in DC, it will destroy our country. Just start with oil alone.All that infrastructure would be wiped out, as most of it is on the coast.        Oldphartbsa     “if its large enough to wipe our our crooked politicians in DC, it will destroy our country.”  No, that would SAVE our country.          Paul     I thought the one we were looking out for was the island of LA palma…. I’m sure I misspelled that          Rolling Thunder     I work a few hundred feet from the ocean here in Florida and live about 3 miles inland.  Even if there is warning I’m sure the roads will be so congested there will be no escape.  Guess I’ll try to get into a boat and hope for the best.        corners     i think you would have to motor out to sea, into the tsunami. You are right though, most people couldnt leave even if they wanted too from all the congestion. And we have seen many times what humans do when their lives are on the line,Survival of the fittest kicks in for most.          DJohn1     Funny you should mention Florida’s geology. My folks lived there for years. So about twice a year I visited for a couple of weeks, enjoyed home cooked meals, enjoyed Clearwater beach. I noticed that acid rain was causing a lot of sink holes. Occasionally a house or car was swallowed over night. The thing is Florida is a giant sandbar in the ocean. The limestone comes from the northern hard water flows over a very long time. If the limestone is eaten up by acid rain, it is very likely the entire state will be several feet below the ocean some time in the future. A giant ocean wave could happen and that might send the sands to the bottom. How much of a shallow water barrier is there off the Atlantic Coast of Florida? Where does the really deep Atlantic waters begin? Personally I have always thought of it as the retirement state. A place where humans go to die. Just like the legendary Elephant Burial Grounds of Africa. Just who would benefit if an entire state of senior citizens suddenly died? Well, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Pension Funds, funeral homes if any bodies are found, not sure where it goes from there. But a good portion of the retirement debt of government would suddenly disappear. Oh well, one more conspiracy theory. The nearest safe place might be Kentucky or Ohio. Though the Tennessee mountains might be safe. There is a huge plain that depends on rain from the gulf stream. That also might change leaving the entire area in a huge drought that might not end ever. Systematic disasters seem to be the norm for planet Earth. So this is as likely as it is anywhere else on the planet.        MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse     Very interesting comment.  Thanks for those points DJohn1.  Michael        puckles     Sinkholes are happening everywhere in the world these days, not just in limestone areas, and there are multiple theories as to why this is happening.  One I tend to credit is planetary expansion.  We know it has happened in the past; why should it not now?  It may well be influenced by solar events, which are likely the primary reason for “climate change,” which has existed for millennia–not a recent event, by far.  The members of the IPCC, alas, are not geological historians; if they were, they would know better.        Lee     Great points! If most humans could think in geologic time we’d be much better off. We understand days are hotter than nights. We understand summers are hotter than winters. No one freaks out when it starts snowing in the winter b/c we expect it. For some reason though no one seems to understand ice ages and how our current location in the universe effects our weather. So we are at the end of an ice age and it’s possibly warming up and everyone is freaking out when the reality is it’s heated and cooled since the beginning of time. There is a reason why our core is made of magma and we have earthquakes and volcanoes. If it weren’t for the world cooling down we wouldn’t exist right now. This rock will be heating up and cooling down much longer than we’ll be around.          Hey Mr Fantasy     Depends.  Where I’m from in Southern WV, we have sinkholes as well.  It’s the same Karst topography as FL, just in mountain form.  Supposedly the real reason for the sinkholes is the draining of the FL Aquifer for agriculture.  Coal mining is supposedly responsible for the ones in WV.  Whether or not this is true…well, who knows.  But it makes sense to me (I am not a scientist though).  I wonder about the Panhandle of FL, and the Northern Gulf.  Would it affect that area?  I hope not!  FL is truly a beautiful, amazing state and it’s being destroyed by overpopulation and greedy scum developers that are bound and determined to squeeze every cent they can out of the rape of one of the most stunning places on God’s Earth.  Kind of like the coal mines and WV.  Sad that nothing can be done to stop it, mainly because people worship the Almighty Dollar more than anything else, and have zero respect for anything that doesn’t make them a buck.  Sickening.  I hate to say it but FL needs to be cleansed, I think God created it as a special piece of Heaven on Earth to give us an idea of how it will be…and we have ruined it.  It’s just a tragedy all around, in every way.        Lee Clark     Acid rain doesn’t cause our sink holes. We get lots of rain. In our rainy season we get more rain in ten minutes than CA gets in a decade. Yet it’s still sunny out when it rains. Our rain isn’t really acidic especially when compared to national averages and especially the North East. Our rain reacts with carbon dioxide and decaying vegetation as it sinks/moves down thru the ground to gain it’s acidity. That acidic water erodes soil and rocks underground. That’s just one method to cause them though. Over withdrawal of ground water by humans is another. Movings lots of ground water from one spot and concentrating it in another is another cause. Artificially created ponds of surface water is another cause. Drilling new water wells is yet another. They’ve been happening for thousands of years. They happen all over the world. On to Florida… It’s not a place people go to die. I came here young for a highly lucrative career. I work for a company that’s full of young people doing the same thing. After bouncing all over the country I’ve found it to be the best place to live in America. No state taxes so we keep all of our salary. Low sales taxes too. Plenty of sunshine/blue skies/white clouds. Plenty of clean water/no droughts here. Green all year round. No winter. No snow. Great places to live that are clean and crime free and cost effective compared to most major cities (high end/high quality housing but not expensive). As an example I have a 5,000 square foot house here with pool/hot tub and three car garage/guest house that is the same price as my POS 475 square foot condo was in D.C. (which was cheaper than the one bedroom studio I rented in LA. Big city jobs with big city pay but not all the negatives of a big city. Cost of living and the American dream is easily attainable here compared to the rest of the country. Lots of outdoor activities year round. Awesome state and national parks/forrest etc. Awesome access to the some of the most beautiful beaches in North America. Close to all the cruise lines and Disney Parks. Close to the Bahamas and Caribbean. Lots of personal freedoms. Less restrictive than most states. Lots of lakes/rivers/parks. Great shopping. Great dining. Great boating. The reason I’m reading this article is to decide where to put my Lagoon 450 yacht. Respect your elders. They have lived long lives in crappy parts of the country and have acquired a great deal of life knowledge… they all come here for very good reasons.          johncocktoaston     I’m guessing the number of face-eating cannibals per capita would drop to near zero.

"It's not zero," said Bart Hagemeyer, longtime meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service office in Melbourne. "But the possibility of a tsunami hitting Florida's East Coast is very small." Most tsunamis, also called seismic sea waves, occur in the Pacific and Indian oceans. In those regions, various plates of the Earth's crust grind and joust against each other as one slides over another, breeding earthquakes. The resulting shock of a temblor can propel a wave that will cross an entire ocean, at jet speeds and often imperceptible to ships, before it slows to a relative crawl and rises in a towering wall of water. The history of big waves hitting Florida is short. A powerful earthquake in Portugal in 1755 killed thousands there and launched a tsunami that hit much of the U.S. coast. Scientists don't know if that caused many deaths in Florida, which was sparsely populated at the time. An earthquake in Charleston, S.C., in 1886 triggered a wave that surged up the St. Johns River to Jacksonville, causing few if any deaths. And there was strange incident of a rogue, 18-foot wave that flooded the parked cars of sunbathers on Daytona Beach without warning in 1992. Scientists blamed that on an undersea avalanche, not an earthquake, but it drew much attention. Florida does have a natural defense against a tsunami. The state's shallow, coastal waters will act as a breakwater, dissipating some of the powerful wave's energy. Even though the risk is low, Hagemeyer, other experts and some communities don't ignore the danger. Indian Harbour Beach qualified in 2005 as the U.S. East Coast's first city prepared for a tsunami. The Naval Station Mayport near Jacksonville also holds the designation, and Brevard and Volusia counties include tsunami preparedness in their emergency-management plans. "We've had some people criticize us and say 'You guys are crazy – why do you bother? You're just scaring people,'" said Jackie Burns, city manager at Indian Harbour Beach, a Brevard County community of about 2 square miles and 8,800 residents. To qualify for a National Weather Service TsunamiReady designation, the city installed warning lights along the beach, hooked up a siren and drew up evacuation plans to be carried out by police and firefighters with bullhorns and loudspeakers. They drill regularly on what to do when alerted to a tsunami watch or warning – which hasn't happened yet. Florida also has a short list of what to worry about in the way of tsunami threats. Geologists are keeping an eye on the Puerto Rico trench in the Caribbean for the possibility of a tectonic plate shift – earthquake – that triggers a tsunami. A deadly tsunami, like the one triggered early last year by a major earthquake in Haiti, is more likely to occur in that region than along the U.S. East Coast. An eruption of the active Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands off Africa is thought to be capable of producing a mega-tsunami that could hit Florida. And another major earthquake in Portugal continues to be a worry. A tsunami triggered there would take about eight hours to hit Florida, traveling at 475 mph across open ocean. Since the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2004 that killed nearly a quarter-million people, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has installed dozens of ocean-monitoring buoys, including seven in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Those buoys are watching out for Florida around the clock for what may never endanger anybody alive today. George Maul, director of the Department of Marine Environmental Systems at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, said that looking only at the probability of a tsunami strike on Florida is misleading. A better approach, he said, would be to consider the total risk, which includes the potential frequency of tsunami strikes, the vulnerability of damage to buildings and homes, and the preparedness of communities. Because Florida is poorly prepared, the state's total risk compares to California's, where a strike is more likely but buildings are better designed to withstand one of the waves and residents are better prepared to respond, he said. That's true except for in Indian Harbour Beach, Maul said. "They go through regular drills," Maul said. "They know if a tsunami is coming, they know how much time they have to react, they know what to do in order to get people off the beach."  kspear@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5062.

"Our study calls attention to the possibility that submarine landslides can trigger tsunami waves ," said UM Rosenstiel School Ph.D. student Jara Schnyder, the lead author of the study. "The short distance from the slope failures to the coastlines of Florida and Cuba makes potential tsunamis low-probability but high-impact events that could be dangerous."  The team identified margin collapses and submarine landslides along the slopes of the western Great Bahama Bank—the largest of the carbonate platforms that make up the Bahamas archipelago—using multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection data. These landslides are several kilometers long and their landslide mass can slide up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the basin.  An incipient failure scar of nearly 100 kilometers (70 miles) length was identified as a potential future landslide, which could be triggered by an earthquake that occasionally occur off the coast of Cuba.  Using the mathematical models commonly used to evaluate tsunami potential in the U.S., the researchers then simulated the tsunami waves for multiple scenarios of submarine landslides originating off the Great Bahama Bank to find that submarine landslides and margin collapses in the region could generate dangerous ocean currents and possibly hazardous tsunami waves several meters high along the east coast of Florida and northern Cuba.         A potential future landslide.

The study, titled "Tsunamis caused by submarine slope failures along western Great Bahama Bank," was published in the Nov. 4 issue of the journal Scientific Reports .

Dr Simon Day said a landslide in the Canary Islands could send the huge wave speeding thousands of miles across the Atlantic to the Americas. The increasingly unstable Cumbre Vieja volcano could dump a chunk of land the size of the Isle of Man into the ocean, triggering a mega-tsunami with deadly consequences.

He told Express.co.uk: "A wave could curve towards Britain, depending on the power, but it will have the biggest impact on the Americas."     7.8 earthquake hits New Zealand  Mon, November 14, 2016  A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake has triggered a tsunami off the coast of New Zealand – near the same place a tremor killed dozens of people.

He said: "It's [been] fifteen years of controversy. "There was a series of objections. But independent modelling has shown the same things as me. My response is it’s better to know so we can prepare."       GETTY A landslide at the Cumbre Vieja volcano could spark a devastating tsunami A report put forward by Dr Day said waves up to 80 feet in height could strike the Americas should a landslide occur in the Canary Islands. It read: "Even after crossing the Atlantic, a lateral collapse of Cumbre Vieja volcano could impose a great sequence of waves of 10-25 m height on the shores of the Americas." GETTY New York could be struck by a tsunami following a landslide in the Canary Islands While Dr Day's thesis was first mocked by colleagues, authorities are now taking the tsunami threat seriously and preparing for a disaster. Various organisations, including the US Geological Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), now encourage residents living near the coast to prepare for such an event, however unlikely.

Even small tsunamis, which are more frequent, can cause loss of life, injuries and considerable damage.

How Far Inland Would A 300 Foot Tsunami Go On The East Coast?    02/12/2013 | Updated 02/21/2018   Ken Jorgustin   397 Comments       TSUNAMI EAST COAST TERRAIN MAPS SHOWN BELOW  Awhile ago I wrote an article titled “ 300 Foot Tsunami And East Coast Destruction ” regarding the possibility of ‘La Palma’ or ‘El Hierro’ of the Canary Islands partially collapsing into the Eastern Atlantic following a major volcanic eruption there.  This event would likely lead to a mega tsunami that travels across the Atlantic and devastates the East Coast of the United States.  Opinions vary regarding the height of the tsunami and range from 60 feet, to 300 feet, and even higher than that as it rolls up the shoreline of the East Coast of the United States and elsewhere.      How Far Will The Tsunami Go Inland?  “IF” a 300 foot tsunami reached the East Coast, how far inland would it go?  Logically one might reason that the tsunami will travel inland until the elevation of the land is higher than the tsunami. While that sounds logical, there are variables…  Actually, the distance a tsunami will travel inland has more to do with the energy remaining as it hits the shore.  A tsunami will speed across the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour but at a relatively small height (because the ocean is DEEP).  It’s speed decreases as it approaches the shoreline (because the ground beneath it is getting shallower) but it’s energy begins to transfer to its monstrous HEIGHT.  When the speed of the wave approaches zero, the wave breaks, much of its energy is released, and it will not go too much further. A tsunami that reaches a height of 300 feet when it rears up at the shore, will lose energy as it travels inland.  It’s all about energy. Frequency (depending on the source of the tsunami) and Amplitude (shape of ocean floor, shoreline and up-slope factors).  It is conceivable that a given tsunami may rear up quickly (and very high) once it reaches the shore (depending on the shape of the ocean floor leading to the shore), and then ‘break’ and lose much of it’s energy in a relatively short distance. While another tsunami may be more compressed (in frequency) and be thrust forward very quickly while traveling a long distance inland (remember Japan?).  There are scientifically sound reasons for concern that at some point in time a mega tsunami could engulf the entire East Coast with a wave approximating 300 feet in height and sweep everything and everybody inland. The consequences of such an event are nearly unimaginable.    Tsunami Maps (East Coast Terrain)  Out of curiosity and an interest in maps, I have custom built the following elevation maps based on high resolution data from USGS digital elevation maps of the United States, particularly the East Coast. I have modeled several layers of elevation of the East Coast to illustrate various height scenarios of tsunami versus geography as it travels inland.  Having said that, there are many variables and factors affecting how far a tsunami would travel inland. So if you live 20 miles inland along the Florida coast (for example) at an elevation of 50 feet doesn’t necessarily mean that a 300 foot tsunami (at the shore) will have enough remaining energy to travel all the way to your location.  There are some instances whereby such a tsunami would probably only travel several miles inland while there are other scenarios where it may roar up a river way or bay and devastate far inland.  Regardless of the factors, I felt that you may be curious to see following elevation graphics that I layered together which increment 75 feet all the way to 300 feet in height along the U.S. East Coast. I would guesstimate that if you live within 20 miles of the coast, you may be vulnerable to a Canary Island ‘event’. However this is simply my own estimation.  Which Cities Might Be Devastated?  Several observations regarding a 300 foot tsunami would be the probable devastation of the following major East Coast cities…  CITY, (Current elevation above sea level, feet)  Portland, ME (~ 50′) Boston, MA (~ 30′) New Haven, CT (~ 50′) Bridgeport, CT (~ 40′) New York City, NY (~ 20′) Jersey City, NJ (~ 30′) Newark, NJ (~ 50′) Atlantic City, NJ (~ 10′) Wilmington, DE (~ 80′) Philadelphia, PA (~ 40′) Virginia Beach, VA (~ 10′) Wilmington, NC (~ 20′) Myrtle Beach, SC (~ 20′) Charleston, SC (~ 10′) Savannah, GA (~ 10′) Daytona Beach, FL (less than 10′) West Palm Beach, FL (less than 10′) Fort Lauderdale, FL (less than 10′) Miami, FL (less than 10′)  There are countless cities and towns in between these coastal cities. The Eastern Seaboard of the United States includes some of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Over one third of the country (more than 100 million people) live along the East Coast. Evacuation would be virtually impossible for most (except for the astute who act quickly) due to only hours notice, probable doubt, and the subsequent immediate gridlock that would follow.  The maps below simply show elevation (not the expected distance a 300 foot tsunami would actually travel). With that said, the maps provide visualization and reference.    NOTE: An evacuation plan should include: Road Atlas Map For Each State    Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York Coastal Elevation Map     Chesapeake Bay & North Carolina Coastal Elevation Map     North and South Carolina Coastal Elevation Map     Georgia Coastal Elevation Map     Florida Coastal Elevation Map    As is obvious, Florida in particular would be wiped out for many many miles inland from its coast.

We are about 20 miles from the shore line and about 200′ above sea level.  I figured that the rivers would be affected by tsunamis but I wasn’t sure how far inland it would go.  We are less than a mile from a river, so that was a little concern for us.    Reply          Ken  02/12/2013 3:05 PM       It looks to me like your location is fine, in my own opinion, given that even a 300′ tsunami would lose energy (and height) as it travels inland. 20 miles is a long way… Now if you were five miles, that’s most likely another story…    Reply          Mark  04/12/2015 11:39 AM       Will my family be safe in Smithfield ,RI?

Do you have any further depictions of the northern 4/5ths of Maine?  Most Mainers see that southern section as a northern annex of Massachusetts since it’s loaded with starry-eyed liberals and their driving sucks. That area could get flooded and no one would really give a squat anyway. Just sayin’.

When disasters happen, people go into a phase of survive the fittest. Also, food shortages, electrical power, clean water, and waste sanitation.. So technically saying, if a tsunami was to come inland, it would also push a lot of junk inland, desolating the area..its a lot to take in consideration on a situation like this. The best thing I can say is pray that you and yours are safe..and if help is needed by your fellow man or neighbor, help them.    Reply          Mongoose  10/25/2017 9:05 PM       The biggest problem will be surviving the aftermath even if you are lucky enough to survive it.. The damage to infrastructure will make you dependent on what you have with you. Those inland will be left on their own odds are with no power or deliveries of anything for weeks at least. Disaster recovery efforts will be spotty at best as every state and federal agency will be overwhelmed if they survive the wave.

I live in Ga near Al/ Tn border and am probably high enough up to escape major flooding. Its the aftermath. I live next door to a dozen + Fukishimas. I mean with all the volcanic activity lately- forget whatever else they know- how are they not shutting these things down??? The world would be uninhabitable. If they do start shutting them down, that.would be a.go sign. I’m not even talking about the regular.sewage,.disease, resource problems. I’d be better of to drive into the storm than sit and watch my kid.die of poisoning over.days, or hours. Now if they shut them down, I might try to make it over the mountains. Any advice?

People get set and that’s where they are. As for as this is concerned, they will think first of all that it’s just not ever going to happen, and then even if they toss that around in their head (the thought of it really happening) they will procrastinate, and do nothing. So, chances are when it happens they will be where they are and either die or have to survive with nothing…SIMPLE! So with enough common sense they will get to higher ground as soon as possible to avoid any future disappointments and catastrophes. I’m about 3 hours inland in southern Virginia so I think we’re okay, at least from that.

This happens and the entire state is history. They will all be washed out to sea. If it hits on the east coast then the gulf of Mexico will have all the bodies and trash that it can handle, plus all the people that were wiped out from the panhandle of Fla. over to Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana as well. If you haven’t gotten OUT of FL. I would be doing that asap or you can sit around, do nothing, and take your chances.

In reviewing the comments, 1 thing is SUPER CLEAR, people need to learn how to read a MAP!  the graphics that this author put together for this post, are very informative (even if only modeling a possible course of events).  BUT GEE WHIZ…..  it is SUPER important to know how to “see” where YOU ARE on a MAP.  If you can’t, HOW WILL YOU KNOW (or plan) WHERE TO GO if you find you have to do that???  for all the FLORIDA posters, asking if their city will “be ok”, LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC.  the whole of the State of Florida is NOT MUCH higher than sea level. that means, except for man made structures and trees, there is nothing that will keep the wave “energy” from continuing FORWARD across the State.  good grief.

They are saying with a possible Drastic Pole shift happening soon from Planet X or some are calling it 7x account its 7 times larger than Earth, coming into our Galaxy and then going by us and then around us between Jupiter and Earth in its elliptical orbit, there will be 400ft to 600ft Tsunamis happening around the world. They are saying this Orbit around us will take 150-152 Days. It has already started to affect our Weather since 2016, which will get more violent as it gets closer. The US Navy has drawn up Flood Maps showing where we will lose roughly about 150 Miles of our Coast Lines around the USA. The Missippi River will be 50-100 miles across, and the Great Lakes will become one Big Lake. Think of a line from Chicago to St Louis down to the Gulf of Mexico which lies on a major Fault Line. This event is going to cause Massive Earth Quakes, Volcano Eruptions, Massive Flooding,  Fires, Starvation, Extreme High Winds(75-200mph), etc,, around the World. You will probably have to be indoors for at least 5 months, and maybe longer. Each Area will be affected differently. Planet 7X is also pulling in its Gravitational path Large Astroids that will also pelt the World causing more destruction. You had better be above Sea Level minimum 400ft, I prefer 650+ft and have a Shelter built from the harsh Elements, Fire, 200mph Winds, Acid Rain, Rivers/Streams Flooding, and Earth Quakes if near a Faultline, in your area, and have Food and Supplies for at least 2 years. 80% of the World, about 8 Billion People now, lives by the Ocean. Tsunamis can hit from 100mph – 600+mph, so you don’t really have time to react. There is a lot of Smart People from NASA, Scientist, and other sources putting out this Info if you look, Read, Listen. Big Business has slowly been moving its Headquarters/Business’s for the last 20 years out of these Danger Zones. In 1992 a NASA Researcher first noticed Planet X coming into our System and he has mysteriously killed soon afterward. NASA didn’t acknowledge it till 2005. The Russians and the Chinese, and others have been building large Structures to house many 1000’s of People on High Ground. Watch the Weather, Watch the Military, Watch the Rich who have their bugout Shelters, Watch the High-Level Govenment People. Once they institute Martial Law, as the Bad Weather used as the Ploy, it will be too late too really do anything. Martial Law will mean Travel Restrictions, Food Restrictions, Gasoline Restrictions, etc. Vice President Al Gore gave You a hint about 20 years ago, that the Weather would start to change around 2016, he said from Green House Gas’s, but what he was telling you was about Planet X coming. The North pole has already been moving. This Planet comes by roughly every 4500 years, never the same +/- 500 years. In the Bible, it’s referred to as the Red Planet account you can see it with your naked eye about a year before it goes by, and there will be about 3-4 days of total darkness. The Weather changing drastically will be your first big Notice, account we will start to have multiple Volcanoes get active around the World (Bali just became active), Tornados where we never had them before. More Earth Quakes on Land and in the Ocean, so some causing Tsunamis. Don’t say you weren’t warned!    Reply          Rich in Iowa 920ft  01/27/2018 1:33 AM       The highest Elevation in Flordia is like 55ft, so even a small 150ft tsunami would probably sweep over most of the State. Florida is 361 miles wide and 447 miles long. If an Earth Quake happens in just 5000ft of Ocean, it’s Speed alone could be 600+mph. You don’t have time to react.  The Great Galveston Hurricane,[1] known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900,[2][3][4] was a Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 145 mph (233 km/h), which made landfall on September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, in the United States. It killed 6,000 to 12,000 people, making it the deadliest hurricane and natural disaster in U.S. history. That’s just a Tidal Surge.  The Highest Tsunami on Record is like 1730ft! I don’t know at what Speed it hit Alaska.    Reply          Rich in Iowa 920ft  01/27/2018 9:31 AM       You really should update your Map Model for up to 650ft Tsunamis! If the largest on Record is 1730-1740ft even that may not be enough. What Speed and Height of Tsunami would be created if a Large Astroid hit in the Ocean?

Reply            Tyler D  02/13/2013 12:43 PM       I have seen where landslides can cause huge waves/tsunami but once the wave traveled the ocean radiating it’s enengy out like a rock thrown into a pond,,,don’t you think the energy would be greatly reduced?  Or at least spread out over thousands of miles??  If you were within a few hundred miles of the slide I could see 100′ plus waves.  I am in West Palm so maybe I am just engaged in wishful thinking 🙂    Reply          Ken  02/13/2013 1:50 PM       You are absolutely correct that the energy is spread out, although depending on the source it could be somewhat focused rather than perfectly symmetrical.  I have watched a few documentaries on mega-tsunamis, and there are various opinions regarding the height of a Canary Island event reaching the East Coast. I recall that 200 – 300 feet were exemplified. Again, as stated in the article, this would vary according to the ocean floor at any given location, the focusing in bays and waterways, etc.  In West Palm though, I believe that unfortunately you be soggy toast. Having said that, this may not happen for 1,000 years… or maybe next month… 😉    Reply          rar6178  12/16/2015 7:21 PM       Cumbre Vieja, erupts on La Palma and will create a mega  tsunami Such a landslide from a future eruption could travel up to 60 kilometres (37 miles) from La Palma’s coast, causing the formation and then collapse of a dome of water 900 metres (3,000ft) high﻿ so now what do you think a wave 3000ft high will do?

Look for the precursors. Being ‘aware’ of your own geographical risks is the first step – recognizing that there IS as risk. Subsequent preparedness might involve the basics, like having a plan and/or an evacuation plan. Think about Water, Food, Shelter, Security. Our website and others are filled with all sorts of related preparedness information. Just begin browsing and formulating your own ideas. The fact that you are thinking about it is something that most other people do not – so you’re already one step ahead. Also, be aware that there is a lot of ‘conspiracy’ out there (although some of it is true!), so use common sense and critical thinking to weed through some of the BS.    Reply          david  06/23/2015 12:38 PM       @Aimee – that comet prediction for Sept 2015 is apparently based on one persons nightmare about it happening near him (in Puerto Rico), and massive internet massaging of his “dream”. I can’t see an event in the mid-Atlantic affecting the Pacific NW to any great degree. There may be a theoretical risk to your area from the large fault in the Pacific near the Oregon-California border, but the science(?) of past events like that, every 300 years, describes a 200-300 ft tsunami along the coast close to the fault. Guess for that, you might be interested in knowing what the elevation in your area is?

I see at first this “300” foot tsunami would go less than 10 miles inland but then i see later in your findings Florida would be wiped out. The reason I’ am curious is that a volcano by Africa is very active. No one knows when it will erupt, but when it does the East Coast (entire East Coast) will be hit.

In fact, if you had the means (an appropriate sea-worthy boat) and if you feared massive traffic congestion or the inability to escape inland in time, and IF you had adequate warning (BEFORE the tsunami started pulling water out of the shore prior to its onset), then yes, escaping in a boat would be viable. As long as you were offshore a bit (distance depends on the underlying seafloor), the effects will be minimal. The tsunami doesn’t rear up and create the devastating wave until it is closing in on the shore…  These are a lot of “if’s”    Reply            not joking  07/19/2013 9:57 PM       I’m seriously considering a move to maine, and though I love many spots along the coast, my hubs and I are both sincerely concerned about a tsunami, thus my question to you is, would it be safe to say, anything in Maine, to the left of 95 would be good?

The reasoning of the question is that after watching some of the survival prepper shows, if some individuals were to have subterranean shelter, that could be made water tight, the amount of available oxygen would be limited and thus there would be the need to open the watertight seals to allow for proper oxygen replenishment depending on the number of individuals within shelter.  What would be the timeline for the recession of the water at the levels shown in the maps?

Reply          Ken Jorgustin  11/02/2013 11:49 PM       I disagree. I highly doubt that it would traverse the state. Although certainly devastating to the entire coastline and probably many tens of miles inland, it would lose impact the further inland it travels. Have you measured the width of the state lately? It’s physics. And I’m not kidding…    Reply          Tom Pence  10/06/2014 1:10 PM       Sugarloaf mountain is on the southwest shore of lake Apopka twenty miles west of Orlando. Its elevation is greater than 300 feet and there is a ridge in this same area that has elevations in the 200f range. Also,this is approx 55-60 miles inland from the east coast. A 300 foot tsunami will not reach or cover Sugarloaf. No way, no how.    Reply          Susan  03/04/2017 6:26 PM       How will the Washington, DC area be impacted by a tsunami.

Reply          Ken Jorgustin  10/03/2013 5:46 PM       While the St. Lawrence River is a funnel from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it appears that the only real opening from the Atlantic is about 50 miles across to the Gulf, which would then have to hang a left down the St. Lawrence, and then we’re looking at hundreds of miles to Lake Ontario. My instinct tells me that the effects would be muted well before then.

They say they are preparing for an upcoming natural disaster.  I’m on the Gulf Coast of Florida, according to your map, we are doomed.

The most likely major disaster, currently, is financial collapse, in my opinion.  “according to your map, we are doomed. Also I saw a map that this will effect the southeast portion of Tx too. Is this accurate?”  -The map simply illustrates height above sea-level. If a 300′ tsunami is generated from the Canary Island region, I do not believe that it will traverse the state of Florida due to energy loss as it hits the shoreline. As far as Texas and the Gulf, the effects of the tsunami will be greatly reduced because it is mostly blocked by Florida from the East. This would primarily be an east-coast event.

It depends upon more than the elevation and force. While all of that is eminently logical, it also would cause terrible disease from polluted water. There would be not only flooding, but dead folks and livestock. The later would float as debris as well as the flooded animal areas filled with fecal matter. Likewise the sewage of such an event would be completely without mitigation.  Depending upon the time of year, then one could expect terrible issues with not only sanitation but ruined crops, disease spread by pests and insect vectors from such a mammoth event too. Ground water in other nearby regions may be foul and make the area unliveable.  … I once wrote a very long post elsewhere concerning bugging out folks from the East Coast, particularly along the Atlantic Seaboard. There’s a huge number of people who live there. As such, anyone attempting to get away would likely head West and South entirely dependent upon the season in which a collapse occurred. As such, those bugging out would very likely cause a chain reaction of other folks attempting the same thing. It would cascade with bugging out folks innundating the nearby towns as they ran low on fuel and supplies. They’d strip the land of resources. At first the locals would be glad of the newcomers purchasing supplies, food, and motel rooms. Then the locals would realize that the credit/debit cards were worthless and that they’d given away what supplies were locally available.  Think about that. If you live on the East Coast, then bugging inland would likely take you away from all of your supplies and heavy items like water and would result in terrible chaos and violence.  I sure wouldn’t live anywhere close to the East Coast now. I can think of many scenarios in which living there would result in doom in most any kind of collapse event.  Look at the National Drought Monitor map. Wherever once relocates to must have adequate rainfall and clean accessible water for not only drinking but raising crops and livestock. After look at that map and considering the scenario above, that almost immediately knocks out 90% of the Western USA. Why? It is too arid. Sure the population density is very low in some places, but unless you can expect an agricultural future, then there is no future. All of the West has suffered long term drought save a few places. That affects both agriculture but also game animals and fish too. Long term drought leads to terrible losses of soil microbes for nitrogen fixation. That makes it sterile. There is high salinity too.  So with BOTH things in mind, that should tell folks how far away to get from the East Coast, but not too far. I’m not a believer in the Western Redoubt model for this main reason.    Reply          Paul  11/18/2013 8:25 AM       Linden will be fine. Staten Island will take the hit.

Reply          HopefulNotHopeless  11/18/2013 3:26 PM       By the time the decision is made to alert the public to evacuate is given, then the roads will be completely full of much higher than normal congestion. Given a bad economy and the avoidance of routine car maintenance, then one can expect many stalled overheated vehicles among them. As such, many folks may be trapped in traffic.  Meditate upon this. How far could you travel realistically in your vehicle if everyone else is also trying to drive away? By my estimates (I wrote a very long article about this once), at best if your gas tank was 3/4 full (since one cannot always top off a fuel tank), and if there was enormous traffic, and your credit cards/atm cards are not working, and gas station owners are worried themselves about evacuating (so hence no honest possibility of refueling), then one can probably only travel 100-150 miles AT MOST.  There are maps on the Internet that show population density. I urge you to look them up. Since many folks prefer to live in urban areas, as they would be evacuating mostly via interstate highways, then the closer you are to the Eastern Coast, the more the cascades of traffic jams would come into play.  Let’s say one gets away 100-150 miles from their origin point. What then? You are fuelless, low on supplies, and likely have encountered stalled traffic on the highway. People would be panicking and likely armed folks would either be attempting to steal supplies from each other or protect themselves. Would you really wish to be among those folks?  In almost any SHTF scenario, the East Coast is a terrible region to be in. With that kind of population density and without the local agriculture to feed those folks, then there is little chance at long term survival. Under tsunami conditions, well there would be nil chances at survival.

Having said that, a hypothetical tsunami as described, will not go ‘everywhere’ within the elevations that are shown. The shaded-colored coastal areas however, yes, those will certainly be underwater.    Reply            Paul  11/19/2013 10:09 AM       The real threat of a tsunami hitting the East coast and erasing Florida from the map is not a chunk of land breaking from the Canary Islands. The most immediate threat right now (within the next two months) is a string of meteorites that are following comet Ison. Please look it up on youtube and inform yourselves. This comet is not a regular comet. Scientists are puzzled by its formation because it appears to be made up of several segments. When it passes around the sun it could break up into several pieces and no one really knows their trajectory after this. The Earth will be passing through its trajectory and no one knows what it could be dragging because we cannot see what is coming facing the sun. It is very possible that several meteorites will hit our planet and that a larger one could fall near Puerto Rico at an angle that will cause a great tsunami that will hit the East coast of the USA. In addition, no one knows if its passing near the sun will trigger solar flares that will head our way. The sun is about to change its magnetic field and precisely now is when Comet Ison will fly by the sun. We could be without power for several months and I am going to leave it to your imagination as to what can happen if we get hit by a tsunami and there is no power. This scenario can happen in December 2013 or January 2014. Look it up.    Reply          Stepfanie  11/19/2013 4:19 PM       Why the news have not mention any of this?

The meteorites are coming in the direction from the sun, as they are following comet ison. If we look up at the direction of the sun with our telescopes, it is practically impossible to detect anything coming our way. Even the Vatican is in alert pointing their telescopes at the skies. At the most, we will have a twelve hour notice. By then most of the roads and highways will be shut down by the traffic.

Reply          HopefulNotHopeless  11/28/2013 2:45 AM       If you’re truly concerned about regular flooding, then you likely could visit a good local public library plus talk to the local historical society and find out historical flooding in your region.  Anyone close to the water could have issues with soil erosion, sewage contamination (a frequent issue in hurricane zones), alterations in the salinity of the soil by ocean flooding, hurricane impact, tsunami, etc.  Wouldn’t it be better to sit down and strategically look at that kind of data and pray about it as a couple, then to ask strangers to intervene to determine who is right and who is wrong?  Practically every property from a prepper standpoint has issues with it, be it drought resistance, fertility, tornado zones, earthquake, erosion, hurricane, flooding, too arid, too cold, too hot, etc.  Palm Bay Florida is a very large city of over 100,000 and the most populated zone in your county. While you might have a higher chance of acquiring marine life as a food source, salt, temperate weather, almost no freezing issues, on the minus side there are so many as to be innumerable.    Reply          Ken Jorgustin  11/28/2013 7:33 AM       You would need to define “a wave”. Given this particular article and its scenario, the wave is a massive tsunami, which would certainly travel more than 1 mile inland on much of the east coast of FL which is very flat and only ‘feet’ above sea level… that’s my opinion.    Reply          Paul  12/02/2013 5:21 PM       Michelle, I have bad news for you. The tsunami that we are all waiting to occur will submerge Florida state. In fact, after this tsunami, the map of the territory of the USA will change. Chances are that the tsunami will be generated by a meteor that will fall somewhere near Puerto Rico. Since very few people belive this, most of the population will continue living their liveses as usual.    Reply            Paul  12/02/2013 8:20 AM       News from comet Ison: The comet has broken up into thousands of pieces (big and small) as it went around the sun two days ago due to the extreme heat and pressure. Now its trayectory may change because we are dealing with many objects spreading out and slowing down. We could be getting hit by many meteorites in the last weeks of December or early January of 2014. We could even be hit by a mid size meteor capable of causing a great tsunami.

In Japan 19,000 lives were lost, 1.2 million buildings damaged and the wave was 133 feet.  If we were hit by a 300 foot wave, our cities, road, electrical grid, and building would be destroyed.  People who got out, would not be returning. People who stayed, would have no power, water, food or shelter.  Unlike Sandy and Katrina there would be no rebuilding!

The direction of the wave, and the landscape will determine the effects more than simple elevation.  I also wonder what effect the continental shelf will have..  It may serve as a barrier to mitigate the impact. Escape scenario?  (I live on the East Coast).  Even if we are saved from much of the impact, the devastation caused in surrounding area’s will make the East Coast a house of horrors.  I think I’d rather be taken out in the wave.  There are WAY too many people who will live through the initial wave who will think they can “live off the land”.  Ain’t gonna work. Long pig will end up on the menu.

Quote from the article above, “The maps simply show elevation… not the expected distance a 300 foot tsunami would travel.”  The maps have nothing to do with fluid dynamics and the many other variables which would affect the behavior of a tsunami in any given area. The maps present a glimpse of the raw data – height elevation. No more, no less. It’s a starting point for one’s own analysis.

Reply          suzanne  02/03/2014 11:48 AM       Ken, thank you for providing a “model” of could potentially occur. Irregardless if it is a meteor striking or the direct result of the Canary Island volcanic activity and subsequent earthquakes that cause such a deadly tsunami, it is obviously of vital importance to be well prepared in advance.  Harry has offered some very practical tips on what people should be doing and looking for. Seabirds, in fact, any unusual animal migrations and behaviors are very reliable signs that something bad is about to happen. Prior to the devastating tsunami that hit in the Indian Ocean in 2005, many people reported all sorts of animals were “quickly heading for higher ground” in advance of the tsunami. Pets will also alert their owners by becoming increasingly distressed and panicked; they just “know”. The CB radio would be a necessity for communicating.  Pay attention not only to weather radios, but scanners which monitor activity of first response organizations as they often will get the information in advance of the public. Try not to panic so that you can think clearly and make safe discisions for you and your family. Having plenty of bottled drinking water on hand as part of an emergency package, is also recommended. Emergency nutritonal and high energy food items for the short term can be peanut butter, crackers, raisins and trail mixes, granola bars.  As also mentioned back and secondary roads are usually safer bits for avoiding traffic jams on main highways. But be prepared that in the case of either traffic jams or accidnets, because of the timing of impending danger, you may have to leave your vehicle and travel on foot. So have backpacks with a change of clothes, jackets and medications that you need or might need and also a first aid lit. These items should already be packed and either in your trunk or ready to grab at a moments notice. Make sure you and loved ones and friends are right with God now.

The Ring of Fire is extremely active and Cascadia Fault has recently had a doozy of a quake. I read that the Fault is over 700 and one article states over 800 miles long. Estimates of between 5 and 7+ minutes duration as the break goes from one end to the other. I also understand that Mt. Ranier is now active and Mt. St. Helen’s is gearing up again. People who live in coastal cities should be required to go through classes when moving there, explaining the dangers. While Mega Tsunami’s are a rare event, what stops the unlikely scenario of several Mega Tsunami’s happening in a years time? Earth, being in the 17th of a 30 year Volcanism makes this possible.

Reply          People are reading too much into this  07/02/2014 4:28 PM       I am an engineer, have done risk studies, and worked on a tsunami inundation sensor network proposal one time.  There is a 100% chance that part of the Canary Islands will collapse and cause a tsunami. People have no idea when that is going to happen, except probably not in the next few weeks, how large, and in what direction the tsunami will be oriented.  I see a lot of people here asking about their specific location and how that would be. As the author points out, these are not inundation charts, these are altitude charts. These show approximately the maximum extent of a tsunami wave, but even that is not exactly true, because moving water can travel uphill, but at the same time, it is bleeding off energy as friction with the surface.  The wave along the east coast of the Americas (N&S) will not be equal. Tsunamis (this kind) are directional, meaning there is a lobe of higher wave height. If that wave is coming right at you, you might see the 100′ monster, but if you are perpendicular to the lobe, maybe only a few feet. How the wave presents itself locally is due to local geography. A narrowing inlet will see higher wave heights than a circular island with a steep base.  The only way to find out about your location is to run actual simulations of various mountain collapse scenarios and see how that sets up the initial conditions, propagate the wave, then model your local geography. You would need to run thousands of simulations to represent the thousands of ways the mountain can collapse. It has been done for some locations.  But the point is, one must not look at the scenarios in the article as real, they are instructional, but are not possible as presented. To prepare, presume one is either in or out of the inundation zone, and if in, how would one get out? Works for hurricanes too.

Reply          Garry B. Coston  07/28/2014 11:53 PM       I am not an expert on this subject, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that type of event, event happenstance, energy, sea floor topography, and shoreline/land topography all contribute to this play of how fast it travels, how high the wave height will be once it approaches the shoreline, how far inland it travels, and how many lives will be affected and/or lost. The Canary Island scenario, in my opinion, might yield less energy relative to how fast it travels, wave height, how far inland, etc. the tsunami travels, however, a more intense event, like an asteroid, meteor, or other object splashing into the Atlantic would probably garner much more energy, wave height, and moving the tsunami much further inland. I firmly believe that an asteroid or other space object will be the final death knell for the eastern seabord. Just Florida, where I live, will possibly be wiped out either way, but I believe that Florida might fare somewhat better from a Canary Island event. An Asteroid event would garner and produce so much energy, and unbelievable wave heights, that when it the tsunami hits Florida, the land, being that Florida is mostly sand, soft rock, and underground aquifers, will give way and sink as the tsunami continues it assault westward towards the Gulf of Mexico. I could be wrong, but tell me your thoughts please. I do know also that the entire Eastern Seaboard will be severely affected either way but might fare better from a Canary Island event (the water might recede in that instance but with an asteroid event from space, most of the land (i.e. Florida) will probably collapse and sink).

Reply          Coastal Connecticut  03/09/2015 9:56 AM       I have watched just about every Japan 2011 and Asian 2004 tsunami video. Tsunamis are serious business. They hit a coast at full height then eventually reduce height and choose a path of least resistance but in some places double up to great heights like at Minamisanriku were it washed over the tsunami warning center at 50ft above sea level but on the immediate coast.  I can see a Canary Island tsunami funneling directly into the Long Island sound and us not having Long Island for protection. Im near the coast in Ivoryton and we have Bushy Hill Mountain a 1 hr hike away and a few other mountains nearby above 300ft sea level. Ill say just going up a hilly road 300 above sea level would suffice.  Just to let everyone know; that once they do arrive inland to safety, there will be plenty of stores open for food etc if they can get there.  We are mountainous up here in New England and the effects would be mostly immediate coastal and river edges with water funneling in to low resistance areas leaving houses way up high unscathed 10 miles inland.The hills like the breakwaters in Japan (although all breached even the 45 ft fudai tsunami wall at 60ft were the village survived) will lessen the impact.  But this article and watching the footage of people stranded on the hospital roof in Minamisanriku, is going to motivate me to make an emergency backpack for any disaster that may strike. I estimate the cost to be $100 max.  If the canary islands collapse, you’ll have a 5hr notice minimum. Use google earth to look around and find your highest mountain and have a plan and survive off you back pack until you can walk to safety of ride a bike.  The wave that hit Japan was 30 ft high that doubled or channeled up to 100 ft high in certain areas (it wasn’t a 100ft cresting wave). Even if Im at the beach were I work as a ranger, I could walk to a place 300 above sea level in 5 hrs. The key is to have resources to survive at your immediate survival.  The further inland you go, the less height you’ll need to get to provided you don’t end up in an area where the water doubles up due to deflection.

Reply          NRP  05/26/2015 1:11 PM       Honestly Anonymous, I would be a heck of a lot more worried being that close to NYC than a tsunami, having said that I’m probably going to get chastised but…… the chances of a tsunami traveling in that far inland and up 166 feet is a possibility of course, the active maps Ken has here are good. But even with the idea of a tsunami is not as likely as a lot of other threats that are around the pike. But that’s just my feeble opinion for what it’s worth.

I really don’t like feeling that way about people, but the ignorance abounds. How can anyone be so incapable of finding out information yourself? Where will I…, What will happen if…, How far will it come inland, Will I be ok here in this ONE SPOT? What if this, What if that? etc etc etc. Nothing more than seeking confirmation of your own delusions of safety and looking for a reason to tell yourself not to worry, in an area that is OBVIOUSLY at risk! If you have ANY doubt then move!!! If you’re concerned about family get them to move too, if they won’t then good luck to them. Sell everything you can’t load up and hit the road to safer ground, don’t worry about your job, don’t worry about your kids school, don’t say you can’t because…(reason). Just take action instead of trying to find some excuse that would allow your justification of avoiding making the tough decisions.

Reply          Harbinger  06/13/2015 11:02 AM       If you ask me the wave shouldn’t effect Morroco that much . I understand that waves radiate but I believe the wave will be triggered in the southern hemisphere . It’ll break mostly under West African Countries and lose a considerable amount of energy before even being able to devastate in any significant way. If you really think morroco is in danger …….. Just move man . You should decided based on sum info you got from this article . 300 foot wave right ? I need you to take a topographical survey of the west coast of Morroco . Go in land until the elevation than 300 . This should be sufficient enough to keep you safe .  PS. This was laid out in the above article . Lastly i know there is alot of Islam in Morrocco .

It would take a wave from a meteor impact less an 70  minutes to propagate from there to inland Florida.  Since the impact would wipe out communications instantly, you won’t even know the wave had arrived till it’s on top of you. 10′ or 300′, it really won’t matter.

If you are informed of a tsunami, the best way to escape is…. by diving into a swimming pool RIGHT BEFORE the wave hit you…. preferrable leaning your back against the wall from white the tsunami is coming… Cause that gives you more chance to survice since the deadliest part is the first shock/impact!

Reply          David Chura  08/01/2015 5:53 PM       I feel sorry if you think a tsunami of only 300 feet will come, but more then likely a 300 meter tsunami is possible to strike, Why ? The fools that rule will cause the fools themselves to use a nuclear weapon that will raise the waters just off the coasts and there will be no warning ! Have yourselves and the enemies got nuclear subs ? What happens when one of them has an accident ? What happens when anyone one of the nuts that rule or fight for will hit back with the same ? Things will get high or maybe higher !  Now consider the frequency of earthquakes increasing and the intensity is also on the increase, have you not realized that this is mentioned in the bible, and the fact at the end of the age as we know it today it is predicted a massive earthquake shall come, and it shall shake the whole earth ! how big of a tsunami will this cause, and will the continents break apart ? where will you hide ?  Mean while if we had CMAE  or constant magnetic acceleration energy, there will be no need for the fools that rule to desire or seek out fossil fuels. cmae.ca is the only site that seeks this energy we all need.    Reply          Jim F  08/03/2015 6:03 AM       Other than this dude in Puerto Rico who had a dream about the asteroid hit is there any evidence at all that this is going to happen ?  The entire story originated from him.    Reply          Jim F  08/05/2015 8:43 AM       I’ve done some more checking into this story.  There is no real evidence that this will occur.  It’s all a bunch of apocalyptic scare nonsense.  Will we get hit by a tsunami sooner or later – yes.  Will we get hit by an asteroid/comet on September 24 – no.  Will there be a tsunami on September 24 – no.  What we will hear though at the end of September is that there was a miscalculation of the date (in the dream that got this whole thing rolling) and the date has now been moved to yada, yada, yada.  Are we in the end times.  Yes, I believe we are but there will be no rapture on September 23 and when the SHTF is anybody’s guess.    Reply          David Chura  08/05/2015 9:00 AM       You could be right I would love to believe nothing will happen, But why are all the elite and government doing all these maneuvers across the states, You don’t do something for no reason, you don’t build something if you don’t intend to use it, But these guys and some of them the Gov has moved some important offices to Chicago under ground WHY ?  Then military all across north America including Canada is on the move to.  Then there was a notice posted on the weather channel not too long ago, stating to expect a tsunami caused by a 9.2 earthquake on the west coast and said it was 75 years over due, One that occurs every 240 years approx. Definitely something is possibly coming and no one is speaking about it, That could mean a real shortage in fossil fuels, and all the more we need an energy this universe runs on, and the only research for that energy one can put their finger on is cmae.ca. While it is a known fact all governments and scientific fields of research have gone a different direction in this field, such as ring proton and neutron, They have floundered with the actual energy we need,    Reply          Jim F  08/05/2015 9:31 AM       I agree that something is up and that something is not going to be nice.

We cannot tell when but it WILL happen. I hope I’m dead by then because for who ever survives will for sure have to deal with the financial difficulties that follow an event like this. An event triggered from a landslide and I created a 1,700 foot wave. That was in a bay though so in the Cumbre Vieja event it would be very different. There is no way to tell how high/ inland a tsunami in this size would be. But 300 feet is a good average    Reply          Jim F  08/05/2015 2:35 PM       I agree it (asteroid hit – tsunami) will happen at some point in time again but it’s not going to be on September 24 because some guy in Puerto Rico had a dream about it.

Then a dream that taco bell employees were also in a group that was destroying two of the nine worlds each created differently (clockwise the second- which evolved, and the fourth clockwise-that happened in a giant explosion-, there was a central world that was in the middle) They did this to these two worlds and a new world formed, which was their plan.

It is no secret that some in the elite have selected these spots as hideaways, have purchased land, often at existing resort sites already setup to house the wealthy, and are prepared to guard their fortresses. Such encampments will soon need a slave labor force, when the supplies run out.

Reply            BR549  09/18/2015 3:58 PM       Just because a tsunami may reach 100 ft in height does NOT mean that everyone living below that height will need to take SCUBA lessons. It’s far more complex than that. In the same location, I have dived on shipwrecks that, with a four foot surface wave, the lower orbital aspect of the wave only reached 20 or thirty feet below the surface. On one same wreck, at another time, there was a four foot wave on the surface but it its lower orbital aspect was thrashing me back and forth at 110 ft. What that means is that the wave REALLY wanted to be deeper, (probably another 10-20 ft) but its forward movement was impacting the sand and I was caught in the surge.  The latter observance was while hurricane waves were being generated before the actual landfall. The first observance was just normal sized waves for the area with locally generated waves. Still, it is the VOLUME of water under the wave that governs how far a wave will penetrate inland. Speed is a minor factor, since the continental shelf and sloping ocean bottom as a braking surfaces to oncoming waves. How that shows up is that hurricanes waves with a lot greater volume still don’t advance onto the beach much faster than regular waves.  I recall author Willard Bascomb describing one tsunami wave traveling at 400 mph, but since it was only 2 feet high and hundreds of miles between crests, no one on the beach noticed anything unusual. So, since waves are generally slowed down as their lower aspect drags along the ocean bottom, and further braked by trees and buildings, it is far more likely that a 100 ft wave will run out of enough water volume before ever reaching all those house under that 100 ft.  If an asteroid hit the mid-Atlantic, THAT would be a real problem because the volume of displaced water would be off the charts. Although a bit Hollywood, a good way to see how the water behaved was in “Deep Impact” with Elijah Wood and Morgan Freeman. Near the very end, Wood is outrunning the water and you can get an idea of how much momentum the incoming water loses as it encounters the convolution of mountains and valleys.  All I’m saying is that figuring out whose house will get flooded depends on a huge number of factors not the least of which include, volume, speed, frequency, direction. and topographical resistance features. So, the big question to ask is whether the maps drawn relate to merely the height of the wave ……. or take into account the complexities of the previously mentioned factors.  Imagine, if you will, a tsunami wave generated at the Yucatan Peninsula traveling northward to the Gulf shore of the US. That 300 foot wave someone mentioned in an earlier post would never make it to the Ohio River (315 ft elevation) because the wave would have dissipated long before traveling the 1000 miles to the confluence there.    Reply          NRP  09/18/2015 4:11 PM       @ BR549  Agreed, mostly, but a 100′ tsunami wave, 1 mile inland, and 43′ elevation climb in NC where their are usually very few mountain between. Sort of like predicting the earthquake in Tenn. Or the Yellowstone Volcano eruption. Or even worse, the stock markets with obummer’s finger on the Nuke Trigger. Regardless of the if/ands/buts I would opt for the swimming lessons.

All areas along the Eastern Coast will have to deal with tidal waves as a fact they cannot discount, during the coming pole shift. No wall will be strong enough to resist the weight of water that will rise up, 100 feet high, in a steady flood tide, nor are there walls in place today constructed with that in mind. High rise buildings with doors and windows and sewage connections will do more than flood, on the lower floors, they will crush and drop, as the water will create uneven pressure on outside walls, pressure they were never expected to have to resist. New Jersey does not have the elevation or distance from the coast to assure safety. New Jersey is extreme lowland for almost the entire state. Essentially a delta area, there are no rock outcroppings to afford safety from tidal waves that will strike the coastline at a height of 500-600 feet, diminishing only well inland to an average wash over the state of 100 feet above sea level. Soil will wash from under buildings so that they topple. The land in many places will be scoured clean, without a trace, and in some areas no land will even remain. The land abutting the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, to the extent it rises above that 100 foot level and well away from any river outlets by which the sea can pour inland, will afford some protection from tidal waves.    Reply          BR549  09/21/2015 10:02 PM       Well explained, Steve. I had tried to let people know that just because there is a 500 ft wall of water at the shore does NOT mean that everywhere under 500 ft further inland will be inundated. So many factors come into play here, direction, the moon, the tides, the wind, and importantly, the volume of initial seismically displaced water.  So, your 100 ft flood tide would sound about right, assuming that the water’s mass is able to lose sufficient momentum through convolutions within anyone’s local topography. But no matter how you look at it, New Jersey would be toast.

Reply          Tsunami wave to hit East coast  09/27/2015 10:09 PM       Some years ago I had a dream where I saw myself standing in front of the Atlantic ocean contemplating its grandeur and admiring nature’s beauty. In the dream it was a beautiful day to be out in the ocean. As i observed the deep, I noticed that the ocean started behaving strangely, and a great fear came upon me. The disturbance in the ocean happened so suddenly like in the twinkle of an eye! I saw this enormous dark tidal wave approaching the coast very rapidly and stretching from north to south as far as the eye can see. It was the longest, largest tidal wave I have ever seen.For a moment during the dream I thought I was in the flood during the days of Noah. As the wave reached the coast ascending to its appointed height, the number that came to my consciousness during the vision was 1000ft tall. It stood in front of me and I saw the sun seating upon its crest and I felt as if my spirit melted of terror inside me. I pleaded to God from the depths of my soul for mercy and I asked him to please spare my life from such a great destruction. I wanted to run but I knew it was useless, I could not move because of the fear that overwhelmed my soul and flesh; as I am pleading with desperation in my dream calling upon God begging him to please remove me from such destruction, with great difficulty I returned to my body, and I was paralyzed but with my mind completely aware of the situation. I found myself in a state of being here and there at the same time. It was as if my body was still in front of the wave and my mind was looking to access the physical body without being able to establish the connection, and it took me a while to understand that I was dreaming. When I finally made it back fully to my flesh and realized that I was laying on my bed dreaming, I noticed that my entire body was sweating profusely, it felt like if a fountain had burst from within me and there were drops of sweat literally on my entire flesh. It was a horrible vision, horrible to no end… to this day, I refuse to go near the ocean for fear of the dream. I send an email to the weather channel wanting to know how far inland a wave of this magnitude would go but I have not received a response yet from them. After that dream, I have had other dreams of waves coming upon the earth. Among those one will be on the West coast of the US, but that one, would not be as large as the one that will come upon the East coast. I was told as a child that when a dream repeats itself is to be taken as a warning and the repetition means that it will come to pass. So say for example, if a person is living in New England how far would a wave this huge would go inland? Would it reach as far as the mountains? This year some months ago, I had a different dream, and in my dream I saw myself suspended in the air where the clouds dwell and I was standing there looking up, but I did not know why was I there and what was I trying to look at. From the middle of the clouds I was looking at, there appeared a clearing see thru, resembling a fine dew made of clouds but looking like see thru dew. While I was looking to the clearing on the clouds, a man of a gigantic stature appeared on my left and he was wearing a long white tunic, but with his face in the cosmos. I was not allowed to see his face but around where the face should be all I saw was the cosmos. After this, I was caused to lower my body downward but still in a standing up position (travelling straight down effortlessly)  and I came below the man’s feet where I noticed the lower legs and sandals he was wearing. As I descended I saw the hem of his garment and I wondered what was the vision about and the meaning of it, when I heard a voice saying: “Prepare to leave” and after I heard the voice saying that the dream ended. Could someone that is familiar on how to calculate the wave’s radius inland tell me that information?    Reply          Ms. T  10/26/2015 4:16 PM       Your dreams I am sure were so intense.

Reply          Lauren  01/24/2016 12:59 AM       The distance inland depends on the depth (not the height) of the wave, the reason behind it, and the terrain of the land. Without knowing those three criteria it would be impossible to predict. The wave extends to the ocean bottom, so as it approaches the shore it grows in height. It will only achieve its “true” height when it hits the shore. However, once the wave hits the shore it no longer has the push of the ocean behind it so it starts to lose power. Even a 1000 foot wave might dissipate quickly.

The northern and southern coasts would be quite different. Southern coast tent to be shelving whereas north of Massachusetts the coast is very abrupt, over 100 ft within a quarter mile of the coast (sometimes just yards).  The though on within a quarter mile of the Exeter River, like many northern rivers it is small an tortuous. Even the river is more than  100 ft above sea level here, and there are land rifts of over 100 ft. between here and the coast which would adsorb a lot of energy. Though only 15 mi from the coast the bulk of the water would have to travel 25 or 30 mi, or surmount large obstacles. Topography is paramount. Water intersecting water absorbs energy.

Everyone was running & fleaing for their lives heading upward to the mountains. I was among them terrified for my life only caring if I alone survived. Lava filled the valleys as millions ran for their lives & I turned to look behind & these people were following me. I yelled I can’t save you! I looked around the terrain & even though I had never been there I knew this was Hawaii or one of its islands. We were trapped & could only go upward. The day became night from the ash & the valleys raised with lava. When we reached the summit of the peak & awaited our fate. I remembered that morning I had been visited by a messenger who had given me a message to read at precisely at 2pm. I asked someone the time & was told it was 2 o’clock. I took the piece of paper out & read it. The only thing I will say is: GOD DEVISED a plan to save the people on that island because I believed the message & 1 man gave all his efforts we worked together. Near the end we weren’t sure everyone would get off. When it came to the last group one had to remain behind & this man told me to go.with great love & admiration I pushed him  & said you go I’m ok. & I was. As afraid as I was of dying & the lava. This man saved the people & he showed me how to care for someone other than myself. There is no doubt in my mind this was Hawaii. I don’t understand the dream but Hawaii is Hawaii & at some point it is destroyed. Rather in this quake or in a future event it’s gone.

I wouldn’t be too worried about tsunami dreams.    Reply            Sunstar  08/26/2016 2:44 PM       I just want to point out that Manhattan is sheltered by the outer boroughs. If a 75 foot wave doesn’t skip over Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, Manhattan would be generally unharmed. If a 300 ft tsunami arrives, go to Todt hill on SI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Reply          Whatabout  09/23/2016 1:36 AM       Will my internet service still be available during a Tsunami ?    This is pretty important!

Some of us will not be able to make that kind of move.

I’m only 15 miles as the crow flies from the ocean and only about 100 ft above sea level.    Reply          Ken Jorgustin  03/21/2017 7:12 PM       Whoops, I see that I did indeed cut off part of NJ. Just tie a boat to your 2nd floor window and you should be fine.  😉    Reply            Names  04/17/2017 12:53 PM       Most of northern nj will be fine lol what would a 300 foot wave do to a 1400 foot mountain lol    Reply          Out of NJ  06/01/2017 6:06 PM       Nothing. Up there in Northern NJ you’re basically shielded by NYC and Long Island.  Only thing I’d be worried about is stuff from the Passaic river contaminating the lower elevations as it’s pushed north by the flow.   As if devastating water isn’t enough to worry about.  Then there’s the nuke plant down near AC…. that’s not a fun scenario either.    Reply          Names  07/10/2017 8:23 AM       Yeah even though I live in the mountains a nuclear meltdown would be really bad. Also the ammount of refugees that would come. There would be tensions between the locals and the refugees over resources, land, and values (locales socially conservative) (refugees socially liberal mainly).The economic trouble afterwards would be really bad. Its possible the U.S. govornment could collapse or be extremely weakened. Civil war would also be possible. Now that I think about it, even though I live in the mountains its the aftermath that would be worst.    Reply            Out of NJ  06/01/2017 6:03 PM       I’m moving from the NJ shore to Charlotte NC in the summer of 17. Believe it or not, the Canary Islands thing is on my mind, along with global warming.  Good to know that this isn’t a problem I’d have to worry about going where I’m going.  BTW, today is the day that The President announced pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord – which is what got me looking anew, and I found this blog.  Thanks for the information. Great stuff here.    Reply          Names  07/10/2017 8:46 AM       Found this. Doesn’t show a 300 feet scenario, but it shows what the canary island landslide would produce. Hope it helps.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb4T8a1K5tw  Also to all the people asking will I be okay in New Jersey? Yes and no. If you live in central or southern new jersey it is extremely dangerous. However northwestern new jersey is very mountainous and is a safe haven, although like Out of NJ says, the nuclear plants could cause problems.

But I’m wondering if the Delaware River will flood all the way north, up there? Or are Phillipsburg and Easton safe bets?    Reply          Ken Jorgustin  12/29/2017 6:53 PM       The potential devastation would remain pretty much near the shoreline in this hypothetical scenario. While a massive tsunami of this magnitude would travel up rivers and waterways to an extent, and push inland to an extent, it will lose it’s energy fairly rapidly as it travels inland.  There have been lots of people who have commented on this article who live well inland and have been concerned about impact. If you are many miles away from the shoreline, and depending on geography an terrain, chances are you may be okay.  The main reason that I posted this article had to do with the fact that LOTS and LOTS of people live very near the shoreline. And “if” this tsunami were to take place, these people and their property would be devastated.    Reply            hi  12/31/2017 1:14 PM       I live in NJ about 20 minutes from Philadelphia & the Delaware River, our elevation is 60 ft, would there still be a big wave that comes down the river and engulfs everything or would it just be more of a flood?

I used to work at Johns Hopkins Hospital there and there is very limited road network that is jammed in “Normal” times.  2 hour warning to evacuate to where?  The folks east of Baltimore MD may have a head start to flee towards the mountains of Maryland IF they roll as soon as the warning is issued.  Folks if you live in a social Tinderbox subject to “Fredde Grey” issues and such need to have a solid PREPACKED Full Gas Tank Bug out vehicle AND a Solid Place to go to.  Refugees suffer, get robbed by Gimmie Dats and die.  Plan Folks Do NOT be a Refugee.    Reply            prioris  03/17/2018 8:47 PM       This map simulation make no sense. Tsunamis don’t maintain their height.  A tsunami wave crests near the shore line. After collapse, it would pile up the water and push the water inland. A 10 meter tsunami goes 1.2 kilometers inland. One guess for 30 meter tsunami  is it would go generally 20 miles inland on near sea level land. If your on a river connected to where tsunami hit, a wave will surge up that river so don’t be near any connected rivers.   Also beware that the west coast of florida can get walloped just as hard as east coast due to wrap around effect so don’t make mistake of going to west coast and sun yourself on the beach..    Reply          Anonymous  03/21/2018 7:49 PM       Just remember all of us that came to Florida –came here to die—so be it 50 years, 50 day’s or 50 Hour’s —It matters not–The weather has been better here long enough to be worth it.

Possible landslide locations are in blue, and future mapping locations are indicated by the red circles, one of which is in Mobile. (National Weather Service)  By Leigh Morgan     Think the Gulf Coast is safe from tsunamis? Not so fast.   Why all the #TsunamiPrep info this week? Contrary to popular belief, Gulf Coast is NOT immune from a tsunami (more rare than other coasts) -- NWS Mobile (@NWSMobile) March 24, 2015    It's Tsunami Preparedness Week , and National Weather Service offices nationwide -- including those along the Gulf Coast -- are raising awareness and offering safety tips in case one comes your way.  A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves usually caused by a major earthquake on the sea floor, a landslide or volcanic activity. They can strike any ocean shoreline at any time, but are most common in the Pacific.  While tsunamis in the Gulf of Mexico are rare, the Gulf states were added to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System in 2005.  Texas A&M University at Galveston has been researching the threat of a tsunami in the Gulf. According to their research, the greatest risk of a Gulf tsunami comes from underwater landslides or earthquakes.  The chance of a tsunami forming outside of the Gulf and then striking local coastlines appears small.  How an underwater earthquake can cause a tsunami. (NOAA)  According to the university, a massive underwater landslide poses the greatest risk for a tsunami for the Gulf Coast, but the probability of that happening is low.  The Texas A&M University at Galveston Tsunami Research Group has developed a 3D numerical model for what could happen after a submarine landslide. The 3D model is combined with a 2D model to depict how a tsunami could affect coastal areas.  See a simulation of a tsunami in the Gulf here .  Researchers are planning a study in Mobile and four other Gulf Coast locations to determine how vulnerable they will be. The other sites are Panama City and Texas' South Padre Island, Freeport and Galveston.  According to NOAA, each year there are approximately two tsunamis that cause damage near their source. Destructive, ocean-wide tsunamis like the one in 2004 that struck near Indonesia and killed more than 230,000 people are more infrequent.  A few other things about tsunamis:  *According to NOAA, low-lying coastal areas such as beaches, bays, lagoons, harbors and river mouths and areas along rivers and streams that lead to the ocean are at greatest risk. Tsunami waves can wrap around headlands and islands, so coasts facing away from the tsunami source may also be at risk.  *Like earthquakes, tsunamis can happen at any time of the day or night, during any kind of weather and in all seasons.  *Even small tsunamis can be dangerous. Strong currents can injure and drown swimmers and damage and destroy boats in harbors.  *A tsunami is not surfable. Tsunami waves are not like wind waves. They do not have a face, do not curl and break like wind waves and are full of dangerous debris.  *It only takes 6 inches of fast-moving water to knock over an adult and 2 feet of fast-moving water to carry away most vehicles.  *The water can be just as dangerous (if not more so) as it returns to the sea, taking debris and people with it.  *The warning signs of a tsunami are: A strong earthquake felt in a coastal area, a rapid rise or fall in coastal waters or a loud roaring sound coming from the ocean.  *A tsunami is not just one wave, but a series of them that could last for hours. And the first wave is not always the largest.  Find more information on tsunamis and how to prepare and stay safe here .
