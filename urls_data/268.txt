Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Posted In: Health and Safety Tags:  health and safety , mexico information    General Zika (ZIKV) Information  The Zika Virus is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is transmitted by the same type of mosquito linked to dengue and chikungunya.  Cases have been identified across four continents. It has been detected in more than 20 countries in the Americas, including the United States.  One of the major concerns regarding Zika is that its spread may be linked to birth defects such as microcephaly, prompting some countries to advise pregnant women against going to areas where Zika has been detected.  Symptoms can include: mild fever, rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle or joint pain, and a general feeling of illness that begins two to seven days after infection. Four out of five people who are infected show no symptoms at all. If you are not a woman of childbearing age, pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, the Zika virus is unlikely to cause you any serious trouble.  ZIKV cannot be transmitted from person to person through air, food, or water. Nevertheless, the virus can be transmitted via sexual contact and there are strong indications of infection via blood transfusion.  There have been no deaths attributed to the Zika Virus so far. Those infected usually just need to take aspirin, drink water, and get lots of rest, but aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided until dengue can be ruled out. Medicine such as acetaminophen is suggested to relieve fever and pain. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. There is no known vaccine or cure for Zika at this time.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is developing a Zika vaccine that shows promise in its first phase of testing. As part of its phase two trial, the NIAID is “ currently leading an international effort to evaluate ” the vaccine. Mexico is part of this international effort .  Important Update: On November 18, 2016 the World Health Organization declared that Zika was no longer a global health emergency and should be considered a dangerous mosquito-borne virus because, like malaria or yellow fever. Read, “ Zika Is No Longer a Global Emergency”     CURRENT UPDATE: APRIL 2ND, 2018 ZIKA VIRUS IN MEXICO  As of April 02, 2018 there have been 41 confirmed cases of Zika across Mexico during 2018. You can find a complete state-by-state breakdown  here , or click here and scroll down to ‘Documentos’  and click on the arrow next to “Cuadro Casos Zika.”  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has no current ZIKV notice for Mexico, but it acknowledges there’s a risk of Zika Virus in the country.  Mexico has and continues to take steps to prevent the spread of the Zika virus infection through public service announcements, campaigns and preventive travel advisories and warnings. Mexico’s Epidemiological Surveillance System is fully prepared to recognize and diagnose infections by Zika virus.  The WHO has stated that “there should be no restrictions on travel or trade with countries, areas and/or territories with Zika virus transmission.”  There are currently no restrictions against travelers visiting Mexico. Both the US Government and Mexican authorities have not placed a general restriction on visiting Mexico, only urged caution to prevent mosquito bites.  GUIDELINES AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES  Stay informed about the ZIKV situation as it develops.  Prevent mosquito bites by covering exposed skin with sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks.  Sleep under a mosquito net to prevent bites.  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin and reapply as directed. Insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus are very effective and safe when used according to the label. If you’re also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.  The CDC recommends that women who are pregnant in any trimester consider postponing travel to areas where there’s risk of Zika virus transmission. If pregnant women do opt to travel to Zika affected areas, the CDC recommends to avoid mosquito bites during their trip. Specific guidance for women who are trying to become pregnant is also included in the CDC advisory .  JOURNEY MEXICO RECOMMENDS  At Journey Mexico we take the health of our clients very seriously, but we strongly believe that the Zika virus does not pose an extraordinary threat to our travelers.  We have no known cases of Zika with any of our passengers, staff members, and guides. We continue to monitor Mexico’s specific situation.  We advise, as always, to travel sensibly and take precautions to avoid getting mosquito bites, as they can also transmit other diseases, like dengue. We are only recommending that pregnant women consider visiting Mexico at another time in accordance with CDC/WHO advice. If you’re considering Mexico as a destination for future travel, we recommend purchasing travel insurance.  The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.   *The categories shown on this map are intended as a general guideline and should not be considered to indicate absolute risk. Elevation may vary within an area to a larger extent than this map can depict. The presence of mosquitoes may change seasonally, with increasing temperatures or rainfall, and may change over time.

Where it has existed in Mexico has been very localized, and there have been very few cases. Throughout the years Mexico has had effective campaigns to eradicate other mosquito-borne diseases. The campaign has been done in the tropical areas, mostly the south and the rural areas, and these campaigns have been very effective. The places where Zika has taken place have been specific and rural with difficult access. It has not been an element that is present in the resorts.”   source: Travel Weekly / One-on-one with tourism board director by Meagan Drillinger   Mexico Map Indicating Location of Zika - Feb 2016  In an effort to help travelers understand precisely where in Mexico cases of the Zika virus have been found the Mexico Tourism Board released a map indicating where Zika has been reported.  “All of the resort areas are Zika-free … the Zika problem is not throughout the country,” said Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, CEO of Mexico’s Tourism Board.  Negrete noted that there are currently 65 reported Zika cases in Mexico. Of those, 35 are in Chiapas, 21 in Oaxaca, four in Nueva Leon, and one each in Jalisco, Sinaloa, Guerrero, Veracruz and Yucatan.   source: Travel Weekly / Mexico draws map indicating location of Zika cases by Michelle Baran   Mexico Remains Proactive in Reducing Risk of Zika Virus  February 9, 2016 – Mexico City –  No need to cancel vacation plans to Mexico’s top hot spots as the Mexico Tourism Board continues to improve on efforts to reduce the risk of Zika virus, especially in major international tourism destinations.  Through ongoing proactive communications and meetings with tourism destinations and travel partners, the goal is to keep the flow of information sharing open through open dialogue. Preventive measures and educational materials have been developed and disseminated, including posters and key facts; and infection reducing procedures are being reinforced.  “Our Mexico Tourism partners continue to demonstrate their strength in addressing travelers concerns,” states Jack E. Richards, President and CEO of Pleasant Holidays. “It’s very clear they are committed to being very proactive to reduce the risk of Zika, especially in the primary beach destinations of Huatulco, Mazatlan, Vallarta-Nayarit, Ixtapa, Cancun, Riviera Maya and Los Cabos. The Mexico Tourism Board sets a high standard for others to follow in similar situations.”  In a related survey released by the Travel Leader’s Group conducted to gauge the impact of the Zika virus on vacation travel, their findings note the majority of travelers are continuing with their travel plans where there have been confirmed Zika virus cases.  The latest reports from Mexico are a total of 65 cases in only 8 states. Of the prior 34 reported cases, patients are on the road to recovery and new cases will be treated immediately. The Zika virus reported is a low-grade strain and non-life threatening. It is important to note that the cases in Mexico represent a nominal percentage (less than .003%) of all the cases, globally.  “The reality is Zika virus does not pose a massive risk to health in Mexico,” notes Pablo Kuri Morales, Mexican Undersecretary for Prevention and Health Promotion.  The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) February 1, 2016 statement confirms there is no reason to cancel or change travel plans to any country reporting Zika virus cases, including for pregnant women. With this advisory applying to all countries, even those with high numbers of cases, it’s yet another reason that Mexico, with a very low number of cases, continues to be a destination that millions of tourists are visiting each month.   Zika Virus Poses No Risk to Mexico Tourists February 3, 2015 – Officials from Mexico’s Ministry of Health met with tour operators from the United States and Canada yesterday in Cancun, Mexico, at a meeting organized by the Mexico Tourism Board. The meeting focused on a report of the latest Zika virus facts, the prevention and containment efforts by the Mexican government and tourism industry, and a continued practice of close coordination with the international tourism industry. Dr. Alberto Diaz Quiñonez, Deputy General Director of the Mexican Institute for Diagnostic and Epidemiology, shared that Mexico has only 34 confirmed cases of the Zika virus, representing just 0.03% of the total cases reported globally. All of these cases are from Mexican nationals living in rural areas, far from the tourist destinations frequently visited by international tourists. Dr. Diaz shared, “While the Zika virus is inevitable in Mexico given its vast size, climate and trade in the region, the number of cases remains very low. Strong prevention efforts have already been in practice for years to prevent similar diseases.” He went on to emphasize, “Given these facts, there is no threat to tourists visiting Mexico.” For several years Mexico’s major tourist destinations and businesses have practiced world- class procedures to control the mosquito population and minimize cases of dengue and other diseases. Hotels, restaurants, airports, and other areas frequently visited by tourists have in place mosquito eradication practices and closely follow international guidelines to monitor and control their growth. Given that the Zika virus is contracted in a manner similar to other mosquito-borne diseases that Mexico has long been combating, the entire country and especially its tourist destinations, are already well prepared to contain this latest disease. Dr. Diaz referenced the World Health Organization (WHO)’s February 1, 2016, statement confirming that there is no reason to cancel or change travel plans to any country reporting Zika cases, including for pregnant women. With this advisory applying to all countries, even those with high numbers of cases, it’s yet another reason that Mexico, with a very low number of cases, continues to be a destination that millions of tourists are visiting each month. Following the meeting, the group of international tour operators affirmed that Mexico’s comprehensive preparations and control measures give them the confidence to continue to recommend travel to Mexico for all tourists.  Mexico tourism industry not impacted by the Zika Virus Mexico City, Mexico, January 21, 2016 – The Mexico Tourism Board reported that the Zika virus infection is a new and emerging disease in the country with only a minimal number of cases identified. Epidemiologic studies have found that the virus is under control in the country. With very few cases identified and containment efforts in place the tourism industry in Mexico has not been affected and is not at risk. The Ministry of Health of Mexico launched a variety of measures to maintain epidemiological control of the virus and limit its potential to spread. As the Zika virus infection is similar to that of dengue and chikungunya, prevention programs, health communication activities, and epidemiology screenings implemented since 2014, have helped to minimize the breeding of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in the country. Measures to prevent and control the virus will remain in place to inhibit an outbreak. Additionally, stronger clinical services and operations, epidemiology screenings, health communication programs and vector control efforts have been deployed. The Mexico Tourism Board urges visitors to follow the guidelines presented by the Ministry of Health of Mexico to reduce the chance of mosquito bites. Recommendations for the public and pregnant women: • Wear long sleeves, pants, and bug repellant • Wash and cover the containers and dishes that hold water • Keep doors and windows closed and use screens • Follow prenatal care guidelines  Sources & More: Latin American Travel Association – Zika Virus Questions and Answers (Mar 2, 2016) World Tourism Organization UNWTO – Zika Statement Center for Disease Control and Prevention – Zika Center for Disease Control and Prevention – Interim Guidelines for Pregnant Women During Zika Outbreak Pan American Health Organization – Zika  Mexican Government – Zika Virus Infection in Mexico Mexcio’s Secretary of Health – Zika (Spanish) The Guardian – Zika Virus Speading Explosively About.com – Zika Virus in Mexico This post was written and published on January 29, 2016.

Alissa, the health secretary only provide online the information by states, and information for each city is necessary to contact the local health secretary office (no all the office have people who speak English). We recommend you to contact your resort and asked if they receive some updates for the city or check what are the prevention measures they are taking for the guests.  Have a wonderful week.

(link below) While it seems to be decreasing in some areas, there is still Zika present! May not be a good idea to visit if you’re pregnant, unless absolutely necessary. The link below lists the # of confirmed cases by province. (If you’re traveling to Cancun for example, you’ll have to view stats for the whole province of Quintana Roo) Column 1 shows cases in 2015-2016, column 2 shows cases in 2017, column 3 shows the total for all of those years. Note: Page 1 appears to be general cases of Zika virus, whereas page 2 appears to refer only to cases in pregnant women. I also presume there are some cases that go undiagnosed/unreported…the virus supposedly doesn’t show symptoms in everyone infected.  https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/258140/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_sem_37_2017.pdf   Reply           Rafael Mendez  October 3rd, 2017    Hello Kitty,  Thanks for your comment and you’re right, the report only shows information by state or province (if the information is for each town and city the document will be too long) and as you can see in most of the states the numbers of cases confirmed are going down, this is basically because either the government, companies, and people are working together to eradicate the mosquitos breedings.  In addition, last year the World Health Organization declared the Zika is no longer global health emergency so if you take normal precautions like using an insect repellent you reduce the risk of being biting by a mosquito.  Have a wonderful day.   Reply                 Lisa  September 26th, 2017    Hi, what is the state of Zika in Colima? I’m nervous that my husband is traveling there in early oct. while I’m pregnant.

I would like to get pregnant within the next year … is Zika a big concern? I read that there are not many mosquitos in November   Reply           Rafael Mendez  October 18th, 2017    Hello Sabrina and thank you to reach out to us.  About your question, in the whole state of Quintana Roo there are just 7 confirmed cases of Zika in the year and you’re right during the fall and winter, the mosquitos rates are very low.

We have been trying to get pregnant and we completely forgot about the Zika risk and now we are in complete panic. A Doctor from Ixtapa told us that the risk was minimal this year as there hasn’t been an outbreak and we cant get tested in our country.  Do you you have any advice for us?   Reply           Rafael Mendez  October 23rd, 2017    Hello Sarah,  We hope you had had a wonderful time in Mexico, about your concern and how the doctor explained to you, Zika is no longer an outbreak emergency.  In the following link, you will find the most updated report issued by the Health Secretary in Mexico today and as you will see the number of cases reported in the whole state of Guerrero is very low.  https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/266148/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_SE41_2017.pdf   We hope you find this information useful.

Reply             Laura Wang  November 6th, 2017    I am pregnant and my family is planning to go to Playa Del Carmen later this month. The following report by the department of health says that there are 102 confirmed cases in Quintana Roo as of the 34th week of 2017:  https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/252529/Pano_dengue_sem_34_2017.pdf  Which report should I trust?  Why is there such a huge difference (e.g., 102 vs. 7)?  Thanks!  Laura   Reply           Rafael Mendez  November 8th, 2017    Hello Laura,  Thanks for this report, it’s very interesting. About your concern, this report is about Dengue in Mexico and not about Zika that’s the reason of the difference.  Have a wonderful day!   Reply             Rod  November 8th, 2017    Greetings, We are thinking of going to Los Cabos.  Is Zika still there?  Also, is there a better time of the year where mosquitos are less prevalent.  I understand its better to travel there around April or May where mosquitos are minimal.  Lastly, do moquitos tend to be less at the resorts that are on the ocean?  Thank you for your help. Best regards, Rod   Reply           Rafael Mendez  November 8th, 2017    Hello Rod,  Thanks for your comment and reaching out to us, about your doubts. On the whole state of Baja California Sur, there are just 5 confirmed cases of Zika. The mosquitos rates are less during the fall and winter due to the raining season has ended but as part of prevention to avoid the mosquitos propagation, most of the hotels go with the Health Secretary campaigns to eradicate the mosquitoes breeding.

Reply             Jordan  November 20th, 2017    Hello,  We went to Peurtoa Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Cabo last week. We had a few bug bites. If bitten (we do not know by what), are we to assume we have Zika? The flyer from the trip said that symptoms would occur 12-15 days after infection, but various websites are saying 2-7 days.   Reply           Rafael Mendez  November 20th, 2017    Hello Jordan,  Thanks for reaching out to us, about your doubts, not all the mosquitos transmit this virus but if you start feeling some symptoms we recommend you to visit your doctor and confirm if you got or not the virus.  Have a wonderful week.   Reply             Anna  December 1st, 2017    The most recent PAHO report on Mexico says there have been 334 reported cases of pregnant women with Zika in Quintana Roo total from 2015-2017. How can that number be so drastically different from your source? So hard to make a decision when “reliable” sources contradict each other.   Reply           Rafael Mendez  December 8th, 2017    Hello Anna,  Thank you for your comment, about your doubts, we are not counting the total number of cases from 2015 to 2017 because of since November 18, 2016, Zika was declared no longer a global health emergency by the World Health Organization.  As you can see on the chart provided by the PAHO on its last report, we will notice how the number of cases has dropped down http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=41708&lang=en  And according to the most recent report issued by the health secretary in Mexico, the number of cases of Zika in Quintana Roo (2017) are just 7.  https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/279196/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_sem_47_2017.pdf  we hope the links provided helps you to better compare the actual situation in Mexico.

We are ttc so I am just wondering if we really need to wait the 6 months now. Thanks!   Reply           Rafael Mendez  December 8th, 2017    Hello Sam,  Thanks for your comment, about your concern, Quintana Roo is one of the states with less confirmed cases of Zika and the symptoms began a few days after you get the virus (between 2 or 12 days) but if your husband start feeling any symptoms we recommend to visit your doctor and discard that he got Zika.

We hope this information could be useful 🙂   Reply             maya regev  December 10th, 2017    Hi!

Many thanks!   Reply           Carlos Villamayor  January 10th, 2018    Hi Selina! The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet because of environmental conditions. Mexico City is located above this elevation so there is minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito. Hope this helps and let us know if there’s anything we can do for you!

These countries are currently listed at alert level 2 which means that travelers should practice enhanced mosquito-bite precautions, particularly at-risk groups like pregnant women or couples planning a pregnancy. But this doesn’t mean that the region is totally out of bounds. The Zika-carrying mosquito isn’t found at altitudes above 6,500 feet, which lowers the risk of transmission. However, note that since the virus can also be transmitted sexually, Zika warnings apply to entire countries regardless of altitude.  Where is the Zika virus in Mexico?  According to public health officials, mosquitoes are transmitting Zika to humans in Mexico. The country is at alert level 2, but the travel restrictions only apply to regions below 6,500 feet. According to the CDC , “If your trip is limited entirely to areas above 6,500 feet, there is minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.”  The bad news is that many of Mexico’s most popular destinations are well under that level.  Cancun is a major tourist destination on the Yucatan peninsula, with turquoise waters and low-priced package vacations. Since it is located at sea level, Zika is present in Cancun and you should protect yourself against mosquito bites.  Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of the Baja Peninsula, is another popular beach vacation spot. Despite its dry climate, the area is at sea level which means that Zika is a risk.      On the Pacific Coast, Puerto Vallarta attracts visitors with its long stretches of white sand and attractive town backed by mountains. Once again, the low altitude means that Zika-carrying mosquitoes are present, so take precautions against bites.  Popular towns above 6,500 feet with minimal risk of Zika include Mexico City and Puebla. If you’re happy to trade a beach vacation for a more cultural experience these places could provide Zika-free alternatives.  You could also consider San Cristóbal de las Casas or Guanajuato, although you will need to travel at lower altitudes in order to reach them.  Zika in Belize  Belize is known for its stunning barrier reef, the second largest in the world, as well as Mayan ruins, jungles, caves, and waterfalls. An English-speaking country with a Caribbean feel, it attracts visitors in search of sun and sea and has been popular for honeymoons and babymoons.  The Zika virus has been confirmed in Belize. The country is listed at alert level 2 by the CDC, which means that higher-risk groups should avoid traveling here, and other visitors need to take enhanced precautions, such as protecting themselves from mosquito bites and practicing safe sex.  Zika in Costa Rica  Costa Rica is a peaceful country (it has no army!) whose main draw is ecotourism. Its rainforests, cloud forests, waterfalls, volcanoes, and beaches, in addition to a remarkable biodiversity, have been attracting expats and vacationers in search of pura vida for decades. It’s also popular with honeymooners.  Zika-carrying mosquitoes are present in Costa Rica, and the country is currently at Zika-alert level 2 like the rest of the region.  Zika in Panama  With long coasts and many islands along both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Panama has been gaining popularity in recent years. Coffee plantations, ecotourism, native cultures, black- and white-sand beaches, and of course the Panama Canal, are popular attractions.      But as with the rest of Central America, Zika has been confirmed in Panama so pregnant women, and those planning to be, should look elsewhere for now.  Zika in Guatemala  Unlike its neighbors, Guatemala is not known for its beaches but it offers a traditional culture, beautiful handicrafts (especially textiles), the colonial jewel of Antigua, and the Mayan ruins of Tikal. It is also one of the best and most affordable places in the world to learn Spanish.  Public health authorities have reported that mosquitoes are transmitting the Zika virus to people in Guatemala and the country is at Zika alert level 2.  Parts of Guatemala’s western highlands (such as the city of Quetzaltenango) are above 6,500 feet, which means a lower risk of Zika transmission. To get there you’ll need to travel at lower altitudes but this part of the country could be an option for travelers wanting to minimize their risk of contracting the disease.  Zika in Nicaragua  Cheaper than Panama and Costa Rica, Nicaragua has been attracting clued-in travelers for several years with its long undeveloped Pacific sand beaches, and the remote Corn Islands off the Caribbean coast. A couple of splendid colonial cities, impressive volcanoes, and the largest lake in Central America round off its appeal.  Unfortunately, Zika is present in Nicaragua and, since the country has no areas above 6,500 feet, pregnant women and babymooners should avoid the country for now.  Zika-free alternatives to Central America  If the risks seem too great but you’re desperate for a short-haul escape, all is not lost! There are a handful of Zika-free Caribbean islands that might make a promising alternative to Central America, especially for higher-risk travelers. All information was correct at time of publication but travelers should be sure to check the latest CDC Zika advisories before booking.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   Nov 27, 2017, 9:07 AM      CDC does not do a good job of breakdowns for specific areas. With their methods, you would not step outside in Texas florida, california, texas and so many other USA states, that they do not issue the same warnings for. This data I have found to be accurate for more detail. Mexicos reported rates.. bajainsider.com/article/zika-virus-mexico-no…       Also if you do go even though reported is so minimal, take precautions from the second you are getting off the plane to the resort anyway. Before you step off the plane to the airport terminal spray your legs especially ankles, feet and rest with deet, so on the plane take deet wipes. And do this as you leave your hotel room to get to the plane. and when you go out for breakfast, walks, shopping and so on all day and evening.     Hawaii it is zika free at the moment.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   Jan 29, 2018, 7:17 PM      We just came home yesterday. We did not see or get bit by a single mosquito. Spent a lot of time out at night walking along the hotel strip and lagoon.     It's drier this time of year there so I think that helps to control the mosquitoes.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

View Sample    Sign Up Now     Should women who plan to get pregnant avoid traveling to places with Zika?  Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   28 Nov 2017, 3:07 AM      CDC does not do a good job of breakdowns for specific areas. With their methods, you would not step outside in Texas florida, california, texas and so many other USA states, that they do not issue the same warnings for. This data I have found to be accurate for more detail. Mexicos reported rates.. bajainsider.com/article/zika-virus-mexico-no…       Also if you do go even though reported is so minimal, take precautions from the second you are getting off the plane to the resort anyway. Before you step off the plane to the airport terminal spray your legs especially ankles, feet and rest with deet, so on the plane take deet wipes. And do this as you leave your hotel room to get to the plane. and when you go out for breakfast, walks, shopping and so on all day and evening.     Hawaii it is zika free at the moment.

I LOVE the Yucatán area but no way I'm going down there right now. I always get covered in bug bites down there no matter how much bug spray I use. I had gone to puerto Vallarta before I got pregnant and my doctors office gave me a really hard time for it. They also said there have been reported cases in Ensenada now even. For me, it's just not worth the risk. Reply  Close d  djames47 I had a cruise planned for next month and asked my doctor about it on my first appointment. She advised against it and stated that for me at this stage, the brain is just starting to develop and she wouldn't want me to take the risk of getting Zika especially if it could've been prevented. My husband and I talked about it and don't want to take the risk. My cruise was with Carnival. I spoke with them about getting a refund/credit for a future cruise and I just have to provide a doctor's note. I did have two other trips planned for this week and also another in December that are in USA and was approved by the doctor. Those will be our babymoon trips instead.

Jan. 30, 2017, 6:20 p.m.      The site I just looked at said one new reported case of Zika in the state of Quintana Roo in the past week. Makes a total of 350+.     I don't spend time in Cancun , have heard there aren't many mosquitos, if any, in the hotel zone.     If I was pregnant, I wouldn't risk it. If you are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant in the near future, please speak to your physician.

Cozumel and Isla Mujeres were day trips from either Cancun or Playa del Carmen. Still never saw one. We head to Cancun next week, and we aren't even bringing skeeter spray with.

Re: Zika Virus in Cancun 2017?   May 1, 2017, 7:54 a.m.      I am in cancun now. The mosquitos love us for whatever reason. We're from CA and Texas . My husband might currently have a mosquito virus. I wouldn't be here if I wanted to get pregnant again. There are a lot of mosquitos to us. Cause they find us and we wear repellent.

Re: Zika Virus in Cancun 2017?   May 1, 2017, 8:28 a.m.      We got back from Cancun on Saturday. We got there last Wednesday and we never left our resort. It was super windy and we actually never saw one mosquito the entire time we were there. We had bug repellant bracelets and spray as well. Where are you guys? On a resort? Odd that you are seeing so many as I was told they are mostly near the jungle areas.

Re: Zika Virus in Cancun 2017?   May 3, 2017, 3:45 p.m.      I would definitely talk to your doctor before you go. I believe August is considered the rainy season there and mosquitoes are more prevelant during that time. When we were there it was also very windy which probably helped with the mosquitoes.

Re: Zika Virus in Cancun 2017?   May 3, 2017, 4:28 p.m.      34 weeks?! My doctor told me not to travel AT ALL past 36 and that's awfully close. My husband and I took a short weekend to NYC at 29 weeks and I was miserable enough then - I'm 38 weeks now and the idea of getting on a plane at this stage just sound absolutely miserable to me.     We are planning a trip in September to Hard Rock for my birthday sin baby. I haven't gone to any "zika" areas since finding out I was pregnant, but did travel at the end of July prior to getting pregnant at the end of August. I never got sick and got one mosquito bite that trip.     My humble, non-medical advice is to skip it if you are currently pregnant, and go and have fun if you aren't. Even if you are "planning" to get pregnant in the future, as long as you wait about a month after your trip to try (assuming you don't get sick) you are fine.

Affected states include: Colima, Guerrero, Morelos, Sonora, Veracruz, and Yucatan . Take meticulous anti-mosquito bite measures during the daytime. Pregnant travellers should postpone travel to this country.  For the latest information on Zika virus outbreaks please go to: ProMED-mail. Zika virus (02): Americas, Europe, research, observations. ProMED-mail 2018; January 16: 20180116.5563987. < ProMED-mail >. Accessed on January 17, 2018. Description  Zika Virus infection is caused by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The virus is primarily transmitted by infected daytime biting female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are typically active from dawn to dusk. There is evidence that Zika Virus is also transmitted by other mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Human transmission can also occur through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some patients, researchers have found that the virus can be shed through saliva and urine. Risk Zika Virus is present in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Africa. All travellers are at risk. Long-term travellers and aid or missionary workers going to areas where Zika Virus is endemic are at greater risk. Information about the virus is continuously evolving. However, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika Virus causes neurological complications: Guillain-Barré syndrome (progressive muscle weakness that can lead to temporary paralysis) and microcephaly (decreased head size which may lead to developmental delays) in infants born to pregnant women infected with the virus. Symptoms In the majority of cases, Zika Virus infection is asymptomatic – persons do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. The illness is characterized by pink eye (inflammation of the conjunctiva), a skin rash with red spots on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms which can spread to the palms or soles, and sensitivity to light. Some may also have a lack of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and dizziness. Most people fully recover from the illness within 7 days. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available. The Zika Virus is related to Dengue , Yellow Fever , West Nile Virus , and Japanese Encephalitis . It may be misdiagnosed for Dengue and Chikungunya . Prevention Travellers going to areas with Zika Virus should take meticulous measures to prevent mosquito bites during the daytime. There is currently no preventive medication or vaccine against Zika Virus.  Use a repellent containing 20%-30% DEET or 20% Picaridin on exposed skin. Re-apply according to manufacturer's directions.  Wear neutral-coloured (beige, light grey) clothing. If possible, wear long-sleeved, breathable garments.  If available, pre-soak or spray outer layer clothing and gear with permethrin.  Get rid of water containers around dwellings and ensure that door and window screens work properly.  Apply sunscreen first followed by the repellent (preferably 20 minutes later).  More details on insect bite prevention .     Pregnancy and Zika Virus  Travellers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should postpone travel to areas with Zika Virus transmission.  To avoid sexual transmission of the virus to a pregnant partner , travellers who have been in areas with risk of Zika Virus transmission should practice safe sex for the duration of the pregnancy.  All travellers, particularly partners considering pregnancy , should practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 6 months if one or both partners have travelled to an area with risk of Zika Virus transmission. Practicing safe sex is recommended even if you or your partner do not have symptoms. Most Zika Virus infections are asymptomatic (show no signs or symptoms), but transmission of the virus to another person can still occur.  If you travel to or live in an area with risk of Zika virus transmission, follow meticulous mosquito bite prevention measures during the daytime.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Posted In: Health and Safety Tags:  health and safety , mexico information    General Zika (ZIKV) Information  The Zika Virus is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is transmitted by the same type of mosquito linked to dengue and chikungunya.  Cases have been identified across four continents. It has been detected in more than 20 countries in the Americas, including the United States.  One of the major concerns regarding Zika is that its spread may be linked to birth defects such as microcephaly, prompting some countries to advise pregnant women against going to areas where Zika has been detected.  Symptoms can include: mild fever, rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle or joint pain, and a general feeling of illness that begins two to seven days after infection. Four out of five people who are infected show no symptoms at all. If you are not a woman of childbearing age, pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, the Zika virus is unlikely to cause you any serious trouble.  ZIKV cannot be transmitted from person to person through air, food, or water. Nevertheless, the virus can be transmitted via sexual contact and there are strong indications of infection via blood transfusion.  There have been no deaths attributed to the Zika Virus so far. Those infected usually just need to take aspirin, drink water, and get lots of rest, but aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided until dengue can be ruled out. Medicine such as acetaminophen is suggested to relieve fever and pain. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. There is no known vaccine or cure for Zika at this time.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is developing a Zika vaccine that shows promise in its first phase of testing. As part of its phase two trial, the NIAID is “ currently leading an international effort to evaluate ” the vaccine. Mexico is part of this international effort .  Important Update: On November 18, 2016 the World Health Organization declared that Zika was no longer a global health emergency and should be considered a dangerous mosquito-borne virus because, like malaria or yellow fever. Read, “ Zika Is No Longer a Global Emergency”     CURRENT UPDATE: APRIL 2ND, 2018 ZIKA VIRUS IN MEXICO  As of April 02, 2018 there have been 41 confirmed cases of Zika across Mexico during 2018. You can find a complete state-by-state breakdown  here , or click here and scroll down to ‘Documentos’  and click on the arrow next to “Cuadro Casos Zika.”  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has no current ZIKV notice for Mexico, but it acknowledges there’s a risk of Zika Virus in the country.  Mexico has and continues to take steps to prevent the spread of the Zika virus infection through public service announcements, campaigns and preventive travel advisories and warnings. Mexico’s Epidemiological Surveillance System is fully prepared to recognize and diagnose infections by Zika virus.  The WHO has stated that “there should be no restrictions on travel or trade with countries, areas and/or territories with Zika virus transmission.”  There are currently no restrictions against travelers visiting Mexico. Both the US Government and Mexican authorities have not placed a general restriction on visiting Mexico, only urged caution to prevent mosquito bites.  GUIDELINES AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES  Stay informed about the ZIKV situation as it develops.  Prevent mosquito bites by covering exposed skin with sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks.  Sleep under a mosquito net to prevent bites.  Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents on exposed skin and reapply as directed. Insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus are very effective and safe when used according to the label. If you’re also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.  The CDC recommends that women who are pregnant in any trimester consider postponing travel to areas where there’s risk of Zika virus transmission. If pregnant women do opt to travel to Zika affected areas, the CDC recommends to avoid mosquito bites during their trip. Specific guidance for women who are trying to become pregnant is also included in the CDC advisory .  JOURNEY MEXICO RECOMMENDS  At Journey Mexico we take the health of our clients very seriously, but we strongly believe that the Zika virus does not pose an extraordinary threat to our travelers.  We have no known cases of Zika with any of our passengers, staff members, and guides. We continue to monitor Mexico’s specific situation.  We advise, as always, to travel sensibly and take precautions to avoid getting mosquito bites, as they can also transmit other diseases, like dengue. We are only recommending that pregnant women consider visiting Mexico at another time in accordance with CDC/WHO advice. If you’re considering Mexico as a destination for future travel, we recommend purchasing travel insurance.  The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.   *The categories shown on this map are intended as a general guideline and should not be considered to indicate absolute risk. Elevation may vary within an area to a larger extent than this map can depict. The presence of mosquitoes may change seasonally, with increasing temperatures or rainfall, and may change over time.

Where it has existed in Mexico has been very localized, and there have been very few cases. Throughout the years Mexico has had effective campaigns to eradicate other mosquito-borne diseases. The campaign has been done in the tropical areas, mostly the south and the rural areas, and these campaigns have been very effective. The places where Zika has taken place have been specific and rural with difficult access. It has not been an element that is present in the resorts.”   source: Travel Weekly / One-on-one with tourism board director by Meagan Drillinger   Mexico Map Indicating Location of Zika - Feb 2016  In an effort to help travelers understand precisely where in Mexico cases of the Zika virus have been found the Mexico Tourism Board released a map indicating where Zika has been reported.  “All of the resort areas are Zika-free … the Zika problem is not throughout the country,” said Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, CEO of Mexico’s Tourism Board.  Negrete noted that there are currently 65 reported Zika cases in Mexico. Of those, 35 are in Chiapas, 21 in Oaxaca, four in Nueva Leon, and one each in Jalisco, Sinaloa, Guerrero, Veracruz and Yucatan.   source: Travel Weekly / Mexico draws map indicating location of Zika cases by Michelle Baran   Mexico Remains Proactive in Reducing Risk of Zika Virus  February 9, 2016 – Mexico City –  No need to cancel vacation plans to Mexico’s top hot spots as the Mexico Tourism Board continues to improve on efforts to reduce the risk of Zika virus, especially in major international tourism destinations.  Through ongoing proactive communications and meetings with tourism destinations and travel partners, the goal is to keep the flow of information sharing open through open dialogue. Preventive measures and educational materials have been developed and disseminated, including posters and key facts; and infection reducing procedures are being reinforced.  “Our Mexico Tourism partners continue to demonstrate their strength in addressing travelers concerns,” states Jack E. Richards, President and CEO of Pleasant Holidays. “It’s very clear they are committed to being very proactive to reduce the risk of Zika, especially in the primary beach destinations of Huatulco, Mazatlan, Vallarta-Nayarit, Ixtapa, Cancun, Riviera Maya and Los Cabos. The Mexico Tourism Board sets a high standard for others to follow in similar situations.”  In a related survey released by the Travel Leader’s Group conducted to gauge the impact of the Zika virus on vacation travel, their findings note the majority of travelers are continuing with their travel plans where there have been confirmed Zika virus cases.  The latest reports from Mexico are a total of 65 cases in only 8 states. Of the prior 34 reported cases, patients are on the road to recovery and new cases will be treated immediately. The Zika virus reported is a low-grade strain and non-life threatening. It is important to note that the cases in Mexico represent a nominal percentage (less than .003%) of all the cases, globally.  “The reality is Zika virus does not pose a massive risk to health in Mexico,” notes Pablo Kuri Morales, Mexican Undersecretary for Prevention and Health Promotion.  The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) February 1, 2016 statement confirms there is no reason to cancel or change travel plans to any country reporting Zika virus cases, including for pregnant women. With this advisory applying to all countries, even those with high numbers of cases, it’s yet another reason that Mexico, with a very low number of cases, continues to be a destination that millions of tourists are visiting each month.   Zika Virus Poses No Risk to Mexico Tourists February 3, 2015 – Officials from Mexico’s Ministry of Health met with tour operators from the United States and Canada yesterday in Cancun, Mexico, at a meeting organized by the Mexico Tourism Board. The meeting focused on a report of the latest Zika virus facts, the prevention and containment efforts by the Mexican government and tourism industry, and a continued practice of close coordination with the international tourism industry. Dr. Alberto Diaz Quiñonez, Deputy General Director of the Mexican Institute for Diagnostic and Epidemiology, shared that Mexico has only 34 confirmed cases of the Zika virus, representing just 0.03% of the total cases reported globally. All of these cases are from Mexican nationals living in rural areas, far from the tourist destinations frequently visited by international tourists. Dr. Diaz shared, “While the Zika virus is inevitable in Mexico given its vast size, climate and trade in the region, the number of cases remains very low. Strong prevention efforts have already been in practice for years to prevent similar diseases.” He went on to emphasize, “Given these facts, there is no threat to tourists visiting Mexico.” For several years Mexico’s major tourist destinations and businesses have practiced world- class procedures to control the mosquito population and minimize cases of dengue and other diseases. Hotels, restaurants, airports, and other areas frequently visited by tourists have in place mosquito eradication practices and closely follow international guidelines to monitor and control their growth. Given that the Zika virus is contracted in a manner similar to other mosquito-borne diseases that Mexico has long been combating, the entire country and especially its tourist destinations, are already well prepared to contain this latest disease. Dr. Diaz referenced the World Health Organization (WHO)’s February 1, 2016, statement confirming that there is no reason to cancel or change travel plans to any country reporting Zika cases, including for pregnant women. With this advisory applying to all countries, even those with high numbers of cases, it’s yet another reason that Mexico, with a very low number of cases, continues to be a destination that millions of tourists are visiting each month. Following the meeting, the group of international tour operators affirmed that Mexico’s comprehensive preparations and control measures give them the confidence to continue to recommend travel to Mexico for all tourists.  Mexico tourism industry not impacted by the Zika Virus Mexico City, Mexico, January 21, 2016 – The Mexico Tourism Board reported that the Zika virus infection is a new and emerging disease in the country with only a minimal number of cases identified. Epidemiologic studies have found that the virus is under control in the country. With very few cases identified and containment efforts in place the tourism industry in Mexico has not been affected and is not at risk. The Ministry of Health of Mexico launched a variety of measures to maintain epidemiological control of the virus and limit its potential to spread. As the Zika virus infection is similar to that of dengue and chikungunya, prevention programs, health communication activities, and epidemiology screenings implemented since 2014, have helped to minimize the breeding of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in the country. Measures to prevent and control the virus will remain in place to inhibit an outbreak. Additionally, stronger clinical services and operations, epidemiology screenings, health communication programs and vector control efforts have been deployed. The Mexico Tourism Board urges visitors to follow the guidelines presented by the Ministry of Health of Mexico to reduce the chance of mosquito bites. Recommendations for the public and pregnant women: • Wear long sleeves, pants, and bug repellant • Wash and cover the containers and dishes that hold water • Keep doors and windows closed and use screens • Follow prenatal care guidelines  Sources & More: Latin American Travel Association – Zika Virus Questions and Answers (Mar 2, 2016) World Tourism Organization UNWTO – Zika Statement Center for Disease Control and Prevention – Zika Center for Disease Control and Prevention – Interim Guidelines for Pregnant Women During Zika Outbreak Pan American Health Organization – Zika  Mexican Government – Zika Virus Infection in Mexico Mexcio’s Secretary of Health – Zika (Spanish) The Guardian – Zika Virus Speading Explosively About.com – Zika Virus in Mexico This post was written and published on January 29, 2016.

We recommend you to contact your resort and asked if they receive some updates for the city or check what are the prevention measures they are taking for the guests.  Have a wonderful week.

Can you give me some information on zika in the area?   Reply           Rafael Mendez  September 25th, 2017    Dear Stephanie,  Thanks for your comment and we hope you enjoy your trip to Mexico.  About your question, the Health Secretary in Mexico issue a weekly report with the confirmed cases of zika for States. In Quintana Roo, the number of cases is very low (6 in the whole state)  You can check the report in the following link https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/257051/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_sem_36_2017.pdf  Regards.   Reply             Tricia  September 26th, 2017    Hi we are traveling to Cancun next week and I am wondering about reported cases of Zika. I am currently not pregnant, but hope to be in the near future. Any info would be great. Thanks.   Reply           Rafael Mendez  September 26th, 2017    Hello Tricia,  Thanks for reaching out to us.  About your concern, there are a few reported cases of Zica in the whole state of Quintana Roo. You can see the official report issued by the Health Secretary every week: https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/258140/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_sem_37_2017.pdf  We hope you enjoy your stay in Cancun and we would love to hear about your experience in Mexico 🙂   Reply           Kitty  October 1st, 2017    Take a look at the number of people infected by province – reported as of Sept 18, 2017. (link below) While it seems to be decreasing in some areas, there is still Zika present! May not be a good idea to visit if you’re pregnant, unless absolutely necessary. The link below lists the # of confirmed cases by province. (If you’re traveling to Cancun for example, you’ll have to view stats for the whole province of Quintana Roo) Column 1 shows cases in 2015-2016, column 2 shows cases in 2017, column 3 shows the total for all of those years. Note: Page 1 appears to be general cases of Zika virus, whereas page 2 appears to refer only to cases in pregnant women. I also presume there are some cases that go undiagnosed/unreported…the virus supposedly doesn’t show symptoms in everyone infected.  https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/258140/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_sem_37_2017.pdf   Reply           Rafael Mendez  October 3rd, 2017    Hello Kitty,  Thanks for your comment and you’re right, the report only shows information by state or province (if the information is for each town and city the document will be too long) and as you can see in most of the states the numbers of cases confirmed are going down, this is basically because either the government, companies, and people are working together to eradicate the mosquitos breedings.  In addition, last year the World Health Organization declared the Zika is no longer global health emergency so if you take normal precautions like using an insect repellent you reduce the risk of being biting by a mosquito.  Have a wonderful day.   Reply                 Lisa  September 26th, 2017    Hi, what is the state of Zika in Colima? I’m nervous that my husband is traveling there in early oct. while I’m pregnant.

About your concern, this report is about Dengue in Mexico and not about Zika that’s the reason of the difference.  Have a wonderful day!   Reply             Rod  November 8th, 2017    Greetings, We are thinking of going to Los Cabos.  Is Zika still there?  Also, is there a better time of the year where mosquitos are less prevalent.  I understand its better to travel there around April or May where mosquitos are minimal.  Lastly, do moquitos tend to be less at the resorts that are on the ocean?  Thank you for your help. Best regards, Rod   Reply           Rafael Mendez  November 8th, 2017    Hello Rod,  Thanks for your comment and reaching out to us, about your doubts. On the whole state of Baja California Sur, there are just 5 confirmed cases of Zika. The mosquitos rates are less during the fall and winter due to the raining season has ended but as part of prevention to avoid the mosquitos propagation, most of the hotels go with the Health Secretary campaigns to eradicate the mosquitoes breeding.

Reply             Jordan  November 20th, 2017    Hello,  We went to Peurtoa Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Cabo last week. We had a few bug bites. If bitten (we do not know by what), are we to assume we have Zika? The flyer from the trip said that symptoms would occur 12-15 days after infection, but various websites are saying 2-7 days.   Reply           Rafael Mendez  November 20th, 2017    Hello Jordan,  Thanks for reaching out to us, about your doubts, not all the mosquitos transmit this virus but if you start feeling some symptoms we recommend you to visit your doctor and confirm if you got or not the virus.

Reply             Anna  December 1st, 2017    The most recent PAHO report on Mexico says there have been 334 reported cases of pregnant women with Zika in Quintana Roo total from 2015-2017. How can that number be so drastically different from your source? So hard to make a decision when “reliable” sources contradict each other.   Reply           Rafael Mendez  December 8th, 2017    Hello Anna,  Thank you for your comment, about your doubts, we are not counting the total number of cases from 2015 to 2017 because of since November 18, 2016, Zika was declared no longer a global health emergency by the World Health Organization.  As you can see on the chart provided by the PAHO on its last report, we will notice how the number of cases has dropped down http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=41708&lang=en  And according to the most recent report issued by the health secretary in Mexico, the number of cases of Zika in Quintana Roo (2017) are just 7.  https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/279196/Cuadro_Casos_ZIKA_y_Emb_sem_47_2017.pdf  we hope the links provided helps you to better compare the actual situation in Mexico.

Many thanks!   Reply           Carlos Villamayor  January 10th, 2018    Hi Selina! The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet because of environmental conditions. Mexico City is located above this elevation so there is minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito. Hope this helps and let us know if there’s anything we can do for you!

These countries are currently listed at alert level 2 which means that travelers should practice enhanced mosquito-bite precautions, particularly at-risk groups like pregnant women or couples planning a pregnancy. But this doesn’t mean that the region is totally out of bounds. The Zika-carrying mosquito isn’t found at altitudes above 6,500 feet, which lowers the risk of transmission. However, note that since the virus can also be transmitted sexually, Zika warnings apply to entire countries regardless of altitude.  Where is the Zika virus in Mexico?  According to public health officials, mosquitoes are transmitting Zika to humans in Mexico. The country is at alert level 2, but the travel restrictions only apply to regions below 6,500 feet. According to the CDC , “If your trip is limited entirely to areas above 6,500 feet, there is minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.”  The bad news is that many of Mexico’s most popular destinations are well under that level.  Cancun is a major tourist destination on the Yucatan peninsula, with turquoise waters and low-priced package vacations. Since it is located at sea level, Zika is present in Cancun and you should protect yourself against mosquito bites.  Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of the Baja Peninsula, is another popular beach vacation spot. Despite its dry climate, the area is at sea level which means that Zika is a risk.      On the Pacific Coast, Puerto Vallarta attracts visitors with its long stretches of white sand and attractive town backed by mountains. Once again, the low altitude means that Zika-carrying mosquitoes are present, so take precautions against bites.  Popular towns above 6,500 feet with minimal risk of Zika include Mexico City and Puebla. If you’re happy to trade a beach vacation for a more cultural experience these places could provide Zika-free alternatives.  You could also consider San Cristóbal de las Casas or Guanajuato, although you will need to travel at lower altitudes in order to reach them.  Zika in Belize  Belize is known for its stunning barrier reef, the second largest in the world, as well as Mayan ruins, jungles, caves, and waterfalls. An English-speaking country with a Caribbean feel, it attracts visitors in search of sun and sea and has been popular for honeymoons and babymoons.  The Zika virus has been confirmed in Belize. The country is listed at alert level 2 by the CDC, which means that higher-risk groups should avoid traveling here, and other visitors need to take enhanced precautions, such as protecting themselves from mosquito bites and practicing safe sex.  Zika in Costa Rica  Costa Rica is a peaceful country (it has no army!) whose main draw is ecotourism. Its rainforests, cloud forests, waterfalls, volcanoes, and beaches, in addition to a remarkable biodiversity, have been attracting expats and vacationers in search of pura vida for decades. It’s also popular with honeymooners.  Zika-carrying mosquitoes are present in Costa Rica, and the country is currently at Zika-alert level 2 like the rest of the region.  Zika in Panama  With long coasts and many islands along both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Panama has been gaining popularity in recent years. Coffee plantations, ecotourism, native cultures, black- and white-sand beaches, and of course the Panama Canal, are popular attractions.      But as with the rest of Central America, Zika has been confirmed in Panama so pregnant women, and those planning to be, should look elsewhere for now.  Zika in Guatemala  Unlike its neighbors, Guatemala is not known for its beaches but it offers a traditional culture, beautiful handicrafts (especially textiles), the colonial jewel of Antigua, and the Mayan ruins of Tikal. It is also one of the best and most affordable places in the world to learn Spanish.  Public health authorities have reported that mosquitoes are transmitting the Zika virus to people in Guatemala and the country is at Zika alert level 2.  Parts of Guatemala’s western highlands (such as the city of Quetzaltenango) are above 6,500 feet, which means a lower risk of Zika transmission. To get there you’ll need to travel at lower altitudes but this part of the country could be an option for travelers wanting to minimize their risk of contracting the disease.  Zika in Nicaragua  Cheaper than Panama and Costa Rica, Nicaragua has been attracting clued-in travelers for several years with its long undeveloped Pacific sand beaches, and the remote Corn Islands off the Caribbean coast. A couple of splendid colonial cities, impressive volcanoes, and the largest lake in Central America round off its appeal.  Unfortunately, Zika is present in Nicaragua and, since the country has no areas above 6,500 feet, pregnant women and babymooners should avoid the country for now.  Zika-free alternatives to Central America  If the risks seem too great but you’re desperate for a short-haul escape, all is not lost! There are a handful of Zika-free Caribbean islands that might make a promising alternative to Central America, especially for higher-risk travelers. All information was correct at time of publication but travelers should be sure to check the latest CDC Zika advisories before booking.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   Nov 25, 2017, 1:02 AM      No, it will not be mosquito free on your stated date or any date in the foreseeable future. If you're already scared, you'll likely gain more fear as you go forward on this if you decide to go. The Mexican Caribbean will still be available to visit in the future should you decide to wait.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   Nov 27, 2017, 9:07 AM      CDC does not do a good job of breakdowns for specific areas. With their methods, you would not step outside in Texas florida, california, texas and so many other USA states, that they do not issue the same warnings for. This data I have found to be accurate for more detail. Mexicos reported rates.. bajainsider.com/article/zika-virus-mexico-no…       Also if you do go even though reported is so minimal, take precautions from the second you are getting off the plane to the resort anyway. Before you step off the plane to the airport terminal spray your legs especially ankles, feet and rest with deet, so on the plane take deet wipes. And do this as you leave your hotel room to get to the plane. and when you go out for breakfast, walks, shopping and so on all day and evening.     Hawaii it is zika free at the moment.

Spent a lot of time out at night walking along the hotel strip and lagoon.     It's drier this time of year there so I think that helps to control the mosquitoes.

By Alexandra Sifferlin  June 23, 2017        TIME Health  For more, visit TIME Health .   Last summer, public health experts were on high alert due to the rapid spread of the Zika virus , which has now been proven to cause birth defects and other health problems in infants. Today, experts know far more about the virus than they did at the start of the outbreak. Here’s what you need to know now about Zika.  Should pregnant women worry about Zika while traveling?  Short answer: yes. “Our general advice is that if you are pregnant, you should not go to places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing,” says Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “It’s all a matter of risk. Obviously, if you are staying in an air-conditioned hotel, your risk may be less. However, are you willing to take that risk? We know the consequences of infection of the fetus are huge and lifelong.”      Petersen recommends people check the CDC website for guidance on what locations have active Zika transmission. The CDC updates this list regularly, sometimes on a daily basis. If an area is no longer on the list, Petersen says it’s considered safe to travel. Currently, the CDC recommends that if a pregnant woman or her partner travel to an area with Zika, the couple should use condoms every time they have sex or avoid sex for the rest of the pregnancy, even if they do not have symptoms of Zika.

Women who are planning to get pregnant, and their partners, should also pay attention to where they are traveling. The first trimester, during which women may not know they are pregnant, appears to be the most risky time when it comes to Zika-related health complications for infants down the line.    The CDC recommends that women who travel to areas with Zika who want to get pregnant in the near future wait at least eight weeks after their last possible exposure to the virus before trying to conceive. For male partners, the CDC advises waiting six months after the last possible exposure before trying to conceive. Using condoms is also recommended for the waiting period.  What if I am invited to a destination wedding in a place with Zika? Should I not go?  It may be challenging to get a firm yes or no from your doctor about whether or not you should travel for a major event, though the recommendations are not to go to places with active Zika transmission if you’re pregnant or want to be soon. “My job is to give guidance; I never tell people what to do,” says Dr. Richard Beigi, the chief medical officer of the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “But I think the travel warnings are there for a reason, and nothing has changed from last year other than the fact that we have more information that has validated that Zika causes congenital health problems. The overall risk is the same.”      Deciding to travel despite the risk is ultimately a personal decision. “I ask my patients, ‘Do you really need to go?’ For some people, the answer to that is yes, and that’s fine, and I give them the best advice I can,” Beigi says.  Should I worry about traveling to places that have the types of mosquitoes that can spread Zika?  The CDC recently reported that the types of mosquito that carry Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , are appearing in more counties in the southern U.S. where they haven’t been before. But unless the mosquitoes are transmitting Zika, there’s a “very, very, very low risk,” Petersen says. “In all of the places where we have this kind of mosquito that can spread Zika virus, we also see the kinds of mosquitoes that can spread West Nile and other diseases,” says Petersen. “General mosquito precautions in the summer are important for everybody—not only pregnant women.”      How likely is it that I will get Zika?  Experts can’t give a definitive answer to a person’s chances of getting Zika if they travel to a place that has reported spread of the disease. But experts are getting closer to understanding the likelihood of adverse events should a pregnant woman get infected.  A recent study found that one in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. with a Zika infection had a baby with brain damage or other serious birth defects. The first trimester was the most critical time: 15% of women with confirmed Zika infection in the first trimester had babies with birth defects. Another study found similar numbers for women in U.S. territories, revealing that during their first trimester, nearly 1 in 12 had a baby or fetus with Zika-associated birth defects.      “Out of the data collected, it appears that 5-10% of the time a woman gets Zika during her pregnancy, there will be in impact,” says Beigi. “Most of the impact is a malfunction; some of it is miscarriage. Probably the absolute risk of you having a problem is not very big, but it’s not zero, and it’s hard to know.”  How bad will Zika get in the U.S. this summer?  It’s unclear how many cases of Zika will be expected in and outside the U.S. this summer, though experts say it could be lower than last year. “Based on historical evidence, we would expect that outbreaks this year throughout the Western Hemisphere are going to be less than they were the year before,” says Petersen. “It’s not going away, but since a lot of people have already been infected and are no longer susceptible to infection, it will lower the number of cases over time.”  So far in 2017, about 650 Americans have gotten Zika, though that it is considered an underestimate. Most people do not experience symptoms and will not know they have the virus.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   25 Nov 2017, 3:12 AM      Mexico is still designated as an area with Zika risk.

If you're already scared, you'll likely gain more fear as you go forward on this if you decide to go. The Mexican Caribbean will still be available to visit in the future should you decide to wait.

Re: Zika Virus Cancun Jan 2018   28 Nov 2017, 3:07 AM      CDC does not do a good job of breakdowns for specific areas. With their methods, you would not step outside in Texas florida, california, texas and so many other USA states, that they do not issue the same warnings for. This data I have found to be accurate for more detail. Mexicos reported rates.. bajainsider.com/article/zika-virus-mexico-no…       Also if you do go even though reported is so minimal, take precautions from the second you are getting off the plane to the resort anyway. Before you step off the plane to the airport terminal spray your legs especially ankles, feet and rest with deet, so on the plane take deet wipes. And do this as you leave your hotel room to get to the plane. and when you go out for breakfast, walks, shopping and so on all day and evening.     Hawaii it is zika free at the moment.

Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  21 Posts c  csmith32313 It's definitely a Zika affected area and pregnant women are advised to not travel to the area. You can use mosquito spray with Deet safely but that doesn't guarantee you 100%. The risks do not outweigh the benefits. There are lots of places that aren't Zika affected you can travel.

Reply  Close c  chrismarzo2018 Im from mexico, mexico city though, so no risks here, my doctor told me there is zika risk in any beach around here, and he said its unlikely to get bitten by it but theres a possibility, he left the decision to me, me and my husband have decided not to take the risk and we are going to canada... if you go, make sure to use a good bug spray, good luck! Reply  Close j  jrockgraham @chrismarzo2018  Hi there, are you going to stay in Canada your whole pregnancy or just a babymoon? I am actually supposed to visit Mexico City next month for work. Reply  Close b  booskibee We went to Cancun before I found out I was preggo hubby and I had to both be tested. I'd say better to be safe. Zika is no joke Reply  Close E  Efree0520 If you look on the CDC website, all of Mexico is on a Zika advisory and it's not advised you travel there. I LOVE the Yucatán area but no way I'm going down there right now. I always get covered in bug bites down there no matter how much bug spray I use. I had gone to puerto Vallarta before I got pregnant and my doctors office gave me a really hard time for it. They also said there have been reported cases in Ensenada now even. For me, it's just not worth the risk. Reply  Close d  djames47 I had a cruise planned for next month and asked my doctor about it on my first appointment. She advised against it and stated that for me at this stage, the brain is just starting to develop and she wouldn't want me to take the risk of getting Zika especially if it could've been prevented. My husband and I talked about it and don't want to take the risk. My cruise was with Carnival. I spoke with them about getting a refund/credit for a future cruise and I just have to provide a doctor's note. I did have two other trips planned for this week and also another in December that are in USA and was approved by the doctor. Those will be our babymoon trips instead. Reply  Close M  MdG21 I went to Mexico a month before getting pregnant.. should I tell my midwife? I didn't even think of this when I met her yesterday. I need to get some blood work done tomorrow.

Reply  Close j  jamilakafafi My husband and I had planned our honeymoon in Cancun Mexico. I was advised not to go due by my OB because of the high risk of Zika.

Reply  Close C  ChaChaDipper @MdG21  I went to Honduras a month before I got pregnant and got tested a few weeks ago. Results were negative, praise God! But my midwife didn't encourage me one way or another... I had to choose to make the call to the health dept. and they led me through the process from there. They took urine and blood. I'd talk it over with your midwife like you said.. Reply  Close c  chrismarzo2018 @Lupita05  I think it's safe! Anyplace beyond 1800 mts alttitude is safe!

I don't spend time in Cancun , have heard there aren't many mosquitos, if any, in the hotel zone.     If I was pregnant, I wouldn't risk it. If you are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant in the near future, please speak to your physician.

Re: Zika Virus in Cancun 2017?   May 3, 2017, 3:45 p.m.      I would definitely talk to your doctor before you go. I believe August is considered the rainy season there and mosquitoes are more prevelant during that time. When we were there it was also very windy which probably helped with the mosquitoes.

Re: Zika Virus in Cancun 2017?   May 3, 2017, 4:28 p.m.      34 weeks?! My doctor told me not to travel AT ALL past 36 and that's awfully close. My husband and I took a short weekend to NYC at 29 weeks and I was miserable enough then - I'm 38 weeks now and the idea of getting on a plane at this stage just sound absolutely miserable to me.     We are planning a trip in September to Hard Rock for my birthday sin baby. I haven't gone to any "zika" areas since finding out I was pregnant, but did travel at the end of July prior to getting pregnant at the end of August. I never got sick and got one mosquito bite that trip.     My humble, non-medical advice is to skip it if you are currently pregnant, and go and have fun if you aren't. Even if you are "planning" to get pregnant in the future, as long as you wait about a month after your trip to try (assuming you don't get sick) you are fine.

Affected states include: Colima, Guerrero, Morelos, Sonora, Veracruz, and Yucatan . Take meticulous anti-mosquito bite measures during the daytime. Pregnant travellers should postpone travel to this country.  For the latest information on Zika virus outbreaks please go to: ProMED-mail. Zika virus (02): Americas, Europe, research, observations. ProMED-mail 2018; January 16: 20180116.5563987. < ProMED-mail >. Accessed on January 17, 2018. Description  Zika Virus infection is caused by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The virus is primarily transmitted by infected daytime biting female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are typically active from dawn to dusk. There is evidence that Zika Virus is also transmitted by other mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Human transmission can also occur through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some patients, researchers have found that the virus can be shed through saliva and urine. Risk Zika Virus is present in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Africa. All travellers are at risk. Long-term travellers and aid or missionary workers going to areas where Zika Virus is endemic are at greater risk. Information about the virus is continuously evolving. However, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika Virus causes neurological complications: Guillain-Barré syndrome (progressive muscle weakness that can lead to temporary paralysis) and microcephaly (decreased head size which may lead to developmental delays) in infants born to pregnant women infected with the virus. Symptoms In the majority of cases, Zika Virus infection is asymptomatic – persons do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. The illness is characterized by pink eye (inflammation of the conjunctiva), a skin rash with red spots on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms which can spread to the palms or soles, and sensitivity to light. Some may also have a lack of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and dizziness. Most people fully recover from the illness within 7 days. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available. The Zika Virus is related to Dengue , Yellow Fever , West Nile Virus , and Japanese Encephalitis . It may be misdiagnosed for Dengue and Chikungunya . Prevention Travellers going to areas with Zika Virus should take meticulous measures to prevent mosquito bites during the daytime. There is currently no preventive medication or vaccine against Zika Virus.  Use a repellent containing 20%-30% DEET or 20% Picaridin on exposed skin. Re-apply according to manufacturer's directions.  Wear neutral-coloured (beige, light grey) clothing. If possible, wear long-sleeved, breathable garments.  If available, pre-soak or spray outer layer clothing and gear with permethrin.  Get rid of water containers around dwellings and ensure that door and window screens work properly.  Apply sunscreen first followed by the repellent (preferably 20 minutes later).  More details on insect bite prevention .     Pregnancy and Zika Virus  Travellers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should postpone travel to areas with Zika Virus transmission.  To avoid sexual transmission of the virus to a pregnant partner , travellers who have been in areas with risk of Zika Virus transmission should practice safe sex for the duration of the pregnancy.  All travellers, particularly partners considering pregnancy , should practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 6 months if one or both partners have travelled to an area with risk of Zika Virus transmission. Practicing safe sex is recommended even if you or your partner do not have symptoms. Most Zika Virus infections are asymptomatic (show no signs or symptoms), but transmission of the virus to another person can still occur.  If you travel to or live in an area with risk of Zika virus transmission, follow meticulous mosquito bite prevention measures during the daytime.
