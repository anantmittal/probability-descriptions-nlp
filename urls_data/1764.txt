                                    The Monty Hall Problem          With Two Dice, What’s the Probability of Rolling Doubles? June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

We were talking about probability in math, and I was wanted to know what the probability (odds) of rolling two sixes would be rolling two dice? If it is not to difficult could you tell me what the probability (odds) of rolling any number with two dice were?  Thank You!  Sincerely, Carmen Hi Carmen, First of all we will find how many possible outcomes we have rolling two dice. 
Assume that the first one is Green, the second is Red. Then all possible 
outcomes can be represented in the following table. The numbers in the top row are the possibilities for the red die and the numbers in the first column are the possibilities for the green die. The numbers on the purple background are the sum of the numbers on the red and green dice.    You can see that we have 36 possible outcomes. We are interested only in ONE 
outcome, a 6 on the red die and a 6 on the green die. This gives a total of 12. Thus only one of the 36 possible outcomes has a 6 on both dice and hence the probability of two sixes will be 1 over 36, or 1/36.
Odds in favour 1 to 35, where 35 = 36-1.  For your second question you can read the probabilities off the table. For example suppose you want "the probability of rolling a 4", that is the probability that the sum on the two dice is 4. From the table, there are 3 of the possible 36 outcomes that have a sum of 4. Hence the probability of rolling a 3 is 3/36 = 1/12. Cheers, Andrei and Penny Go to Math Central           Home -> Personal -> TFT ->
Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

Hi Matt.  All the rolls are independent, so rolling double sixes twice in a row is the same as rolling a six (on one die) four times in a row. Since there are six choices, then each time there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a six.  The fact they are entirely independent of each other means we simply multiply each roll's probability together: 1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 = (1/6) 4 = 1/1296 = 0.00077.  Now let's say you had already rolled double sixes. What is the probability of rolling double sixes on your next roll? The answer is 1/36. The past rolls are entirely independent of future rolls, so history doesn't matter.  Stephen.

A Simple Probability Error Almost Everyone Makes (Including this Gambling Author)   by Matt    Tweet  The following is from Joseph Mazur’s new book, What’s Luck Got to Do with It? :  …there is an authentically verified story that sometime in the 1950s a [roulette] wheel in Monte Carlo came up even twenty-eight times in straight succession.  The odds of that happening are close to 268,435,456 to 1.  Based on the number of coups per day at Monte Carlo, such an event is likely to happen only once in five hundred years.                     Mazur uses this story to backup an argument which holds that, at least until very recently, many roulette wheels were not at all fair.  Assuming the math is right (we’ll check it later), can you find the flaw in his argument?  The following example will help.  The Probability of Rolling Doubles  Imagine you hand a pair of dice to someone who has never rolled dice in her life.  She rolls them, and gets double fives in her first roll.  Someone says, “Hey, beginner’s luck!  What are the odds of that on her first roll?”  Well, what are they?  There are two answers I’d take here, one much better than the other.  The first one goes like this.  The odds of rolling a five with one die are 1 in 6; the dice are independent so the odds of rolling another five are 1 in 6; therefore the odds of rolling double fives are  $$(1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36$$.  1 in 36.  By this logic, our new player just did something pretty unlikely on her first roll.  But wait a minute.  Wouldn’t ANY pair of doubles been just as “impressive” on the first roll?  What we really should be calculating are the odds of rolling doubles, not necessarily fives.  What’s the probability of that?  Since there are six possible pairs of doubles, not just one, we can just multiply by six to get 1/6. Another easy way to compute it: The first die can be anything at all.  What’s the probability the second die matches it?  Simple: 1 in 6.  (The fact that the dice are rolled simultaneously is of no consequence for the calculation.)  Not quite so remarkable, is it?  For some reason, a lot of people have trouble grasping that concept.  The chances of rolling doubles with a single toss of a pair of dice is 1 in 6.  People want to believe it’s 1 in 36, but that’s only if you specify which pair of doubles must be thrown.  Now let’s reexamine the roulette “anomaly”  This same mistake is what causes Joseph Mazur to incorrectly conclude that because a roulette wheel came up even 28 straight times in 1950, it was very likely an unfair wheel.  Let’s see where he went wrong.  There are 37 slots on a European roulette wheel .  18 are even, 18 are odd, and one is the 0, which I’m assuming does not count as either even or odd here.  So, with a fair wheel, the chances of an even number coming up are 18/37.  If spins are independent, we can multiply probabilities of single spins to get joint probabilities, so the probability of two straight evens is then (18/37)*(18/37).  Continuing in this manner, we compute the chances of getting 28 consecutive even numbers to be $$(18/37)^{28}$$.  Turns out, this gives us a number that is roughly twice as large (meaning an event twice as rare) as Mazur’s calculation would indicate.  Why the difference?  Here’s where Mazur got it right: He’s conceding that a run of 28 consecutive odd numbers would be just as interesting (and is just as likely) as a run of evens.  If 28 odds would have come up, that would have made it into his book too, because it would be just as extraordinary to the reader.  Thus, he doubles the probability we calculated, and reports that 28 evens in a row or 28 odds in a row should happen only once every 500 years.  Fine.  But what about 28 reds in a row?  Or 28 blacks?  Here’s the problem: He fails to account for several more events that would be just as interesting. Two obvious ones that come to mind are 28 reds in a row and 28 blacks in a row.  There are 18 blacks and 18 reds on the wheel (0 is green).  So the probabilities are identical to the ones above, and we now have two more events that would have been remarkable enough to make us wonder if the wheel was biased.  So now, instead of two events (28 odds or 28 evens), we now have four such events.  So it’s almost twice as likely that one would occur.  Therefore, one of these events should happen about every 250 years, not 500.  Slightly less remarkable.  What about other unlikely events?  What about a run of 28 numbers that exactly alternated the entire time, like even-odd-even-odd, or red-black-red-black?  I think if one of these had occurred, Mazur would have been just as excited to include it in his book.  These events are just as unlikely as the others.  We’ve now almost doubled our number of remarkable events that would make us point to a broken wheel as the culprit.  Only now, there are so many of them, we’d expect that one should happen every 125 years.  Finally, consider that Mazur is looking back over many years when he points out this one seemingly extraordinary event that occurred.  Had it happened anytime between 1900 and the present, I’m guessing Mazur would have considered that recent enough to include as evidence of his point that roulette wheels were biased not too long ago.  That’s a 110-year window.  Is it so surprising, then, that something that should happen once every 125 years or so happened during that large window?  Not really.  Slightly unlikely perhaps, but nothing that would convince anyone that a wheel was unfair.

A standard die has six sides with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the die is fair (and we will assume that all of them are), then each of these outcomes are equally likely. Since there are six possible outcomes, the probability of obtaining any side of the die is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6 and so on for 3, 4, 5 and 6.         But what happens if we add another die? What are the probabilities for rolling two dice? What Not to Do To correctly determine the probability of an event we need to know two things.  First, how often the event occurs.  Then second divide the number of outcomes in the event by the total number of outcomes in the sample space . Where most go wrong is to miscalculate the sample space. Their reasoning runs something like this: “We know that each die has six sides. We have rolled two dice , and so the total number of possible outcomes must be 6 + 6 = 12.” Although this explanation was straightforward, it is unfortunately incorrect. It’s plausible that going from one die to two should cause us to add six to itself and get 12, but this comes from not thinking carefully about the problem. A Second Attempt Rolling two fair dice more than doubles the difficulty of calculating probabilities. This is because rolling one die is independent of rolling a second one.   One roll has no effect on the other one. When dealing with independent events we use the multiplication rule . The use of a tree diagram demonstrates that there are really 6 x 6 =36 outcomes from rolling two dice. To think about this, suppose that the first die we roll comes up as a 1. The other die could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.         Now suppose that the first die is a 2. The other die again could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. We have already found 12 potential outcomes, and have yet to exhaust all of the possibilities of the first die. A table of all 36 of the outcomes are in the table below. Sample Problems With this knowledge we can calculate all sorts of two dice probability problems. A few follow: Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is seven? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is three? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the numbers on the dice are different? Three (Or More) Dice The same principle applies if we are working on problems involving three dice . We multiply and see that there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 outcomes. As it gets cumbersome to write the repeated multiplication, we can use exponents to simplify our work. For two dice there are 6 2 outcomes. For three dice there are 6 3 outcomes. In general, if we roll n dice, then there are a total of 6 n outcomes.

For example, this will help you realise that (2, 3) and (3, 2) are not the same way to get a total of 5. There are 6 ways to get doubles and there are 4 ways to get a sum of 5. List them if you need to. These are mutually exclusive (doubles always have an even total). There are 36 possible results. The rest is easy. 2.5k Views · Answer requested by  Mary L.

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Dave Buchfuhrer , B.S. in Math Answered Feb 7, 2017 · Author has 581 answers and 728.9k answer views What you’re looking for is the Binomial distribution . This tells you that the probability of getting [math]n[/math] successes from [math]t[/math] trials with a probability [math]p[/math] of success per trial is [math]{t \choose n}p^n(1-p)^{t-n}[/math] . This sums the [math]p^n(1-p)^{t-n}[/math] probability of getting any particular set of [math]n[/math] rolls as doubles over the [math]t \choose n[/math] ways of picking which [math]n[/math] rolls are doubles. So the answer you’re looking for is [math]{100 \choose n}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{100-n}[/math] . In the question details, you state that you know the answer would be [math]\left(\frac{6}{36}\right)^n[/math] (which equals [math]\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n[/math] ) if the question didn’t specify how many times you roll. This is not accurate. The answer would only be [math]\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n[/math] if the question specifies that you get [math]n[/math] doubles out of [math]n[/math] rolls. If you don’t specify the number of rolls, there’s no way to know the probability. 406 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below A die is thrown n times.

Let’s say these were both 2s. Then for the second roll, (1/6)(1/6) since there is a 1/6 chance the first will be a 2 and another 1/6 chance the second will also be a 2. For the third roll, again it would be (1/6)(1/6). Then we would use the multiplication rule since this is an “and” problem.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Dan Murphy Answered Apr 30, 2016 Perhaps a simpler way of thinking of this: Since the two dice being rolled are completely independent of one another (that is to say, the one die has no idea what number the other die is landing on at any given point in time, or vice versa), and they have no possible way of affecting one another's outcome, this question is equivalent to "If a 6-sided die is rolled 180 times, how many 4's do you expect to roll?" To which the answer is, of course, 30 (180 rolls / 6 sides). And yes, you can replace the 4 with any number, I just had to pick one for sake of argument :) 713 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below A fair die is rolled 180 times.

This gave me the classic bell-shaped curve that peaked at 30, as expected.  I was surprised to see that one sequence of 180 rolls produced only 17 doubles, while another produced 44!   The largest number of sequences, 28 out of 256, produced 30 doubles. 719 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Statistics and Probability Homework Question  Mathematics Homework Question You are playing a board game in which every turn, you roll 2 dice. However, you cannot begin until you roll doubles (the same number on both dice). If you do not roll doubles, you lose the turn, and must try again next turn. How many turns do you lose until you finally get the doubles you need to start? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers Quora User , University Webmaster and Programmer (1999-present) Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 3k answers and 1.3m answer views Assuming the dice are standard six-sided cubes, the odds of any given number are one in six. To find the odds of doubles on a single roll of two dice, consider the dice one at a time. The first die doesn't affect the probability in any way; all it says is which of six equally likely numbers you need from the second die. In other words, no matter which number the first die rolls, there is a one in six chance that the second die will match it, giving you doubles. Of course, that's still not what you asked. To find out how many rolls it is likely to take before you get doubles, a bit more calculation is needed. For this, it helps to consider the odds of getting non -doubles for some number of rolls in a row. That is the number of rolls you have to wait before you get to move. For a single roll, because doubles only have a one-in-six chance, non-doubles have a five in six chance. For multiple rolls, multiply the single-roll probability by itself once for every roll beyond the first. To do that you need to convert five-in-six odds into a number; just divide five by six, which makes 0.8333... with the three repeating forever. For simplicity I'll round that to 0.83, which can also be stated as 83 percent; in other words, you have an 83% chance of not getting doubles on any one roll. So the probability that your first two rolls aren't double is 0.83 times 0.83, or about 69 percent. For three rolls, it's 0.83 times 0.83 times 0.83, which is about a 58 percent chance that you don't get to go in your first three rolls. The probability of four rolls without doubles is about 48 percent, finally less than an even chance. This means you are slightly more likely to get doubles within your first four rolls than you are to have four unsuccessful rolls in a row. Of course this is hardly a guarantee, so let's go on a bit more. Five non-doubles has a 40 percent probability, and for six it's 33 percent. So, one out of every three times I play this game, I'll still be stuck after six rolls. I don't think this would be my favorite game. 937 Views Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Sarnat , Physician / Anesthesiologist Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 562 answers and 613.1k answer views The chances of rolling a double is 1/6 per roll (6 out of 36 possible outcomes). So the chances of not rolling doubles is 5/6 per roll. A measure of expected number  of rolls is the 50-50 point, for which  you are equally likely to get doubles as not. (5/6)^4 = 0.482, meaning that the chances are 48% of rolling no doubles in 4 rolls, so the chances of rolling at least one double in the first four rolls is 52%.  In other words, in 4 rolls you are slightly more likely than not to get doubles. You can compute it exactly: (5/6)^N=1/2 Take log of both sides, rearrange N = log(1/2) / log(5/6) = approx 3.80 rolls of the dice. Of course, it could take 1000 rolls if you're very unlucky!

I am a member of a grade 5 class in Edmonton, AB. We were talking about probability in math, and I was wanted to know what the probability (odds) of rolling two sixes would be rolling two dice? If it is not to difficult could you tell me what the probability (odds) of rolling any number with two dice were?  Thank You!  Sincerely, Carmen Hi Carmen, First of all we will find how many possible outcomes we have rolling two dice. 
Assume that the first one is Green, the second is Red. Then all possible 
outcomes can be represented in the following table. The numbers in the top row are the possibilities for the red die and the numbers in the first column are the possibilities for the green die. The numbers on the purple background are the sum of the numbers on the red and green dice.    You can see that we have 36 possible outcomes. We are interested only in ONE 
outcome, a 6 on the red die and a 6 on the green die. This gives a total of 12. Thus only one of the 36 possible outcomes has a 6 on both dice and hence the probability of two sixes will be 1 over 36, or 1/36.
Odds in favour 1 to 35, where 35 = 36-1.  For your second question you can read the probabilities off the table. For example suppose you want "the probability of rolling a 4", that is the probability that the sum on the two dice is 4. From the table, there are 3 of the possible 36 outcomes that have a sum of 4. Hence the probability of rolling a 3 is 3/36 = 1/12.

One die rolls a 6.  What is the probability of rolling a double 6?  One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance).  Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1). So the probability of rolling a double six if one six has already been rolled is $\frac{1}{11}$.

second roll. The second roll is independent of the first. So the probability
of a 6 again on the second roll is $1/6.$  If both dice have already been rolled out of your sight, and you are

With this distinction made, yes, the probability of obtaining two sixes when rolling one die twice, and the probability of rolling two sixes simultaneously are equal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 8 '15 at 18:42             answered Mar 8 '15 at 18:26       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  I understand how the sample space is defined. But isn't it the same thing as rolling two dice back to back? it just happens that in the two dice sample, the rolls are happening together. Whereas in the one die example, the rolls happen with a small delay in between. – William Falcon  Mar 8 '15 at 18:28        2      You specified the probability of rolling two sixes. On the other hand, the probability of rolling consecutively (one roll, then another), and obtaining the same number twice is $1/6$. The first roll can be any number (probability of rolling a number $1-6$ is equal to $1$, and then the probability of rolling that particular number on the second roll is $\frac 16$ for overall probability of rolling the same number twice being $1/6$. – amWhy  Mar 8 '15 at 18:32         add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Note that you are asking two different questions.  In the first problem, you are asking the probability of rolling a particular number twice, while in the second problem, you are asking the probability of rolling one of the numbers twice.  The probability of rolling a $6$ twice is 
$$\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$$
but so is the probability of rolling a $1$ twice, a $2$ twice, a $3$ twice, a $4$ twice, or a $5$ twice.  Hence, the probability of rolling the same number twice is 
$$6 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 '15 at 1:56       N. F.

This is the way I thought about the problem. Let $X$ be the random variable describing the number of occurrences of a number $a$, where $1 \leq a \leq 6$. Then the probability that $a$ occurs twice is the binomial  $P(X=2) = {5 \choose 2}(\frac{1}{6})^2(\frac{5}{6})^3 = 0.16$  Now there are 6 possibilities for $a$, so the probability of rolling a pair of any number between one and six is $0.16*6 = 0.96$.  I don't know where I went wrong  but the final answer I get seems wrong intuitively to me. I would be grateful for some correction or verification.    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:05             asked Nov 28 '14 at 13:53       Björn   6 3              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote      You can't simply add the probabilities $P(X=2)$ as $a$ ranges over $1,\dots, 6$, since the events of rolling two of a number aren't mutually exclusive (it is possible to roll two ones and two fives). Furthermore, you would want to look at $P(X\ge 2)$, not $P(X=2)$, since having 3 or more of a number also counts as having a matching pair.  I think the best way to do this problem is first find the probability there is no mathcing pair, then subtract from 1. For the dice to be all different, there are 6 choices for the first die, 5 for the second, 4 for the third$\dots$, and $6^5$ possible rolls total, so the probability is
$$
1-\frac{6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2}{6^5}

If you want to add the probabilities of getting your pair rather than subtracting the probability of not getting a pair, you have to avoid double-counting.
As has already been mentioned, you can roll two $1$s and two $2$s in the same five rolls.
To compute the probability of exactly two $1$s and no other pairs,
you have $5$ choices for the first die that is not in the pair, but for each of those
there remain only $4$ choices for the next die, and at the end there are
only $3$ choices for the last die, so
$$P(\mbox{pair of twos}) = 
\binom52 \left(\frac16\right)^2 \cdot \frac56 \cdot \frac 46 \cdot \frac 36.$$
This event is mutually exclusive from having a pair of $2$s, so now it is OK to
multiply by $6$ to find the probability of having exactly one pair of exactly one number.  If you want at least one pair, then you must also add the probability of
having exactly one pair each of two different numbers
and the probability of having three or more of a single number
(which you could further subdivide into exactly three, exactly four, or five
of the same number).
This is much more tedious and error-prone than the method of subtracting the
probability of no pairs.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:37       David K   44.4k 3 35 95              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      I'm going to assume you're asking for the probability that there is at least one pair, not exactly one pair. These are of course different questions. The probability that there are no matching pairs given five dice rolled is
$$P=1\cdot\frac56\cdot\frac46\cdot\frac36\cdot\frac26=\frac5{54}.$$
The probability that there is at least one pair is $1-P=\frac{49}{54}$.  It isn't too much more difficult to work out the probability that there is exactly one pair. By symmetry and mutual exclusion, this is six times the probability that the number $a$ appears exactly twice and there are no other pairs. This is given by
$$Q=\frac{{5\choose{2}}\cdot{5\choose3}\cdot3!}{6^5}=\frac{25}{6\cdot54}$$
and so the probability is $\frac{25}{54}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:55             answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:12       Jason   11.6k 1 8 29                  Should that be $\binom53$ rather than $\binom43$ in the calculation of $Q$?

Imagine the dice are coloured blue, white, and red. Record the outcome as a triple $(b,w,r)$, where $b$ is the number on the blue, and so on. There are $6^3$ possible outcomes, all equally likely.  How many doubles are there? The number we have two of can be chosen in $6$ ways. For each choice, the number we have one of can be chosen in $5$ ways, and its location (colour) can be chosen in $3$ ways, for a total of $(6)(5)(3)$. the required probability is therefore $\frac{(6)(5)(3)}{6^3}$.  Another way: The probability all the tosses are the same is $\frac{1}{36}$, since whatever we get on the blue, we must get on the white and on the red.  The probability the tosses are all different is $\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{4}{6}$. So the probability of not getting a double is $\frac{1}{36}+\frac{20}{36}$. It follows that the probability of a double is $\frac{15}{36}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 14 '13 at 1:20             answered Oct 13 '13 at 20:47       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      $\displaystyle{%

Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with the first and second die is 6/36, or 1/6.  There is also a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the first and third die.  And a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the second and third die.  Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with all three dice is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 or 1/2 (including triples).  The probability of rolling triples is 1/36 so the probability of rolling doubles with no triples is 18/36 - 1/36 = 17/36.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 21 '17 at 19:43       user494128   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

By contrast, the situation "one dice shows a 4, the other shows a 1" can occur in two ways - either the first dice is 4 and the second is 1, or the first dice is 1 and the second is 4.

June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

We were talking about probability in math, and I was wanted to know what the probability (odds) of rolling two sixes would be rolling two dice? If it is not to difficult could you tell me what the probability (odds) of rolling any number with two dice were?  Thank You!  Sincerely, Carmen Hi Carmen, First of all we will find how many possible outcomes we have rolling two dice. 
Assume that the first one is Green, the second is Red. Then all possible 
outcomes can be represented in the following table. The numbers in the top row are the possibilities for the red die and the numbers in the first column are the possibilities for the green die. The numbers on the purple background are the sum of the numbers on the red and green dice.    You can see that we have 36 possible outcomes. We are interested only in ONE 
outcome, a 6 on the red die and a 6 on the green die. This gives a total of 12. Thus only one of the 36 possible outcomes has a 6 on both dice and hence the probability of two sixes will be 1 over 36, or 1/36.
Odds in favour 1 to 35, where 35 = 36-1.  For your second question you can read the probabilities off the table. For example suppose you want "the probability of rolling a 4", that is the probability that the sum on the two dice is 4. From the table, there are 3 of the possible 36 outcomes that have a sum of 4. Hence the probability of rolling a 3 is 3/36 = 1/12. Cheers, Andrei and Penny Go to Math Central           Home -> Personal -> TFT ->
Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

Hi Matt.  All the rolls are independent, so rolling double sixes twice in a row is the same as rolling a six (on one die) four times in a row. Since there are six choices, then each time there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a six.  The fact they are entirely independent of each other means we simply multiply each roll's probability together: 1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 = (1/6) 4 = 1/1296 = 0.00077.  Now let's say you had already rolled double sixes. What is the probability of rolling double sixes on your next roll? The answer is 1/36. The past rolls are entirely independent of future rolls, so history doesn't matter.  Stephen.

The Monty Hall Problem          With Two Dice, What’s the Probability of Rolling Doubles? June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

A Simple Probability Error Almost Everyone Makes (Including this Gambling Author)   by Matt    Tweet  The following is from Joseph Mazur’s new book, What’s Luck Got to Do with It? :  …there is an authentically verified story that sometime in the 1950s a [roulette] wheel in Monte Carlo came up even twenty-eight times in straight succession.  The odds of that happening are close to 268,435,456 to 1.  Based on the number of coups per day at Monte Carlo, such an event is likely to happen only once in five hundred years.                     Mazur uses this story to backup an argument which holds that, at least until very recently, many roulette wheels were not at all fair.  Assuming the math is right (we’ll check it later), can you find the flaw in his argument?  The following example will help.  The Probability of Rolling Doubles  Imagine you hand a pair of dice to someone who has never rolled dice in her life.  She rolls them, and gets double fives in her first roll.  Someone says, “Hey, beginner’s luck!  What are the odds of that on her first roll?”  Well, what are they?  There are two answers I’d take here, one much better than the other.  The first one goes like this.  The odds of rolling a five with one die are 1 in 6; the dice are independent so the odds of rolling another five are 1 in 6; therefore the odds of rolling double fives are  $$(1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36$$.  1 in 36.  By this logic, our new player just did something pretty unlikely on her first roll.  But wait a minute.  Wouldn’t ANY pair of doubles been just as “impressive” on the first roll?  What we really should be calculating are the odds of rolling doubles, not necessarily fives.  What’s the probability of that?  Since there are six possible pairs of doubles, not just one, we can just multiply by six to get 1/6. Another easy way to compute it: The first die can be anything at all.  What’s the probability the second die matches it?  Simple: 1 in 6.  (The fact that the dice are rolled simultaneously is of no consequence for the calculation.)  Not quite so remarkable, is it?  For some reason, a lot of people have trouble grasping that concept.  The chances of rolling doubles with a single toss of a pair of dice is 1 in 6.  People want to believe it’s 1 in 36, but that’s only if you specify which pair of doubles must be thrown.  Now let’s reexamine the roulette “anomaly”  This same mistake is what causes Joseph Mazur to incorrectly conclude that because a roulette wheel came up even 28 straight times in 1950, it was very likely an unfair wheel.  Let’s see where he went wrong.  There are 37 slots on a European roulette wheel .  18 are even, 18 are odd, and one is the 0, which I’m assuming does not count as either even or odd here.  So, with a fair wheel, the chances of an even number coming up are 18/37.  If spins are independent, we can multiply probabilities of single spins to get joint probabilities, so the probability of two straight evens is then (18/37)*(18/37).  Continuing in this manner, we compute the chances of getting 28 consecutive even numbers to be $$(18/37)^{28}$$.  Turns out, this gives us a number that is roughly twice as large (meaning an event twice as rare) as Mazur’s calculation would indicate.  Why the difference?  Here’s where Mazur got it right: He’s conceding that a run of 28 consecutive odd numbers would be just as interesting (and is just as likely) as a run of evens.  If 28 odds would have come up, that would have made it into his book too, because it would be just as extraordinary to the reader.  Thus, he doubles the probability we calculated, and reports that 28 evens in a row or 28 odds in a row should happen only once every 500 years.  Fine.  But what about 28 reds in a row?  Or 28 blacks?  Here’s the problem: He fails to account for several more events that would be just as interesting. Two obvious ones that come to mind are 28 reds in a row and 28 blacks in a row.  There are 18 blacks and 18 reds on the wheel (0 is green).  So the probabilities are identical to the ones above, and we now have two more events that would have been remarkable enough to make us wonder if the wheel was biased.  So now, instead of two events (28 odds or 28 evens), we now have four such events.  So it’s almost twice as likely that one would occur.  Therefore, one of these events should happen about every 250 years, not 500.  Slightly less remarkable.  What about other unlikely events?  What about a run of 28 numbers that exactly alternated the entire time, like even-odd-even-odd, or red-black-red-black?  I think if one of these had occurred, Mazur would have been just as excited to include it in his book.  These events are just as unlikely as the others.  We’ve now almost doubled our number of remarkable events that would make us point to a broken wheel as the culprit.  Only now, there are so many of them, we’d expect that one should happen every 125 years.  Finally, consider that Mazur is looking back over many years when he points out this one seemingly extraordinary event that occurred.  Had it happened anytime between 1900 and the present, I’m guessing Mazur would have considered that recent enough to include as evidence of his point that roulette wheels were biased not too long ago.  That’s a 110-year window.  Is it so surprising, then, that something that should happen once every 125 years or so happened during that large window?  Not really.  Slightly unlikely perhaps, but nothing that would convince anyone that a wheel was unfair.

A standard die has six sides with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the die is fair (and we will assume that all of them are), then each of these outcomes are equally likely. Since there are six possible outcomes, the probability of obtaining any side of the die is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6 and so on for 3, 4, 5 and 6.         But what happens if we add another die? What are the probabilities for rolling two dice? What Not to Do To correctly determine the probability of an event we need to know two things.  First, how often the event occurs.  Then second divide the number of outcomes in the event by the total number of outcomes in the sample space . Where most go wrong is to miscalculate the sample space. Their reasoning runs something like this: “We know that each die has six sides. We have rolled two dice , and so the total number of possible outcomes must be 6 + 6 = 12.” Although this explanation was straightforward, it is unfortunately incorrect. It’s plausible that going from one die to two should cause us to add six to itself and get 12, but this comes from not thinking carefully about the problem. A Second Attempt Rolling two fair dice more than doubles the difficulty of calculating probabilities. This is because rolling one die is independent of rolling a second one.   One roll has no effect on the other one. When dealing with independent events we use the multiplication rule . The use of a tree diagram demonstrates that there are really 6 x 6 =36 outcomes from rolling two dice. To think about this, suppose that the first die we roll comes up as a 1. The other die could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.         Now suppose that the first die is a 2. The other die again could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. We have already found 12 potential outcomes, and have yet to exhaust all of the possibilities of the first die. A table of all 36 of the outcomes are in the table below. Sample Problems With this knowledge we can calculate all sorts of two dice probability problems. A few follow: Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is seven? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is three? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the numbers on the dice are different? Three (Or More) Dice The same principle applies if we are working on problems involving three dice . We multiply and see that there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 outcomes. As it gets cumbersome to write the repeated multiplication, we can use exponents to simplify our work. For two dice there are 6 2 outcomes. For three dice there are 6 3 outcomes. In general, if we roll n dice, then there are a total of 6 n outcomes.

For example, this will help you realise that (2, 3) and (3, 2) are not the same way to get a total of 5. There are 6 ways to get doubles and there are 4 ways to get a sum of 5. List them if you need to. These are mutually exclusive (doubles always have an even total). There are 36 possible results. The rest is easy. 2.5k Views · Answer requested by  Mary L.

This tells you that the probability of getting [math]n[/math] successes from [math]t[/math] trials with a probability [math]p[/math] of success per trial is [math]{t \choose n}p^n(1-p)^{t-n}[/math] . This sums the [math]p^n(1-p)^{t-n}[/math] probability of getting any particular set of [math]n[/math] rolls as doubles over the [math]t \choose n[/math] ways of picking which [math]n[/math] rolls are doubles. So the answer you’re looking for is [math]{100 \choose n}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{100-n}[/math] . In the question details, you state that you know the answer would be [math]\left(\frac{6}{36}\right)^n[/math] (which equals [math]\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n[/math] ) if the question didn’t specify how many times you roll. This is not accurate. The answer would only be [math]\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n[/math] if the question specifies that you get [math]n[/math] doubles out of [math]n[/math] rolls.

Let’s say these were both 2s. Then for the second roll, (1/6)(1/6) since there is a 1/6 chance the first will be a 2 and another 1/6 chance the second will also be a 2. For the third roll, again it would be (1/6)(1/6). Then we would use the multiplication rule since this is an “and” problem.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Dan Murphy Answered Apr 30, 2016 Perhaps a simpler way of thinking of this: Since the two dice being rolled are completely independent of one another (that is to say, the one die has no idea what number the other die is landing on at any given point in time, or vice versa), and they have no possible way of affecting one another's outcome, this question is equivalent to "If a 6-sided die is rolled 180 times, how many 4's do you expect to roll?" To which the answer is, of course, 30 (180 rolls / 6 sides). And yes, you can replace the 4 with any number, I just had to pick one for sake of argument :) 713 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below A fair die is rolled 180 times.

This gave me the classic bell-shaped curve that peaked at 30, as expected.  I was surprised to see that one sequence of 180 rolls produced only 17 doubles, while another produced 44!   The largest number of sequences, 28 out of 256, produced 30 doubles. 719 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Statistics and Probability Homework Question  Mathematics Homework Question You are playing a board game in which every turn, you roll 2 dice. However, you cannot begin until you roll doubles (the same number on both dice). If you do not roll doubles, you lose the turn, and must try again next turn. How many turns do you lose until you finally get the doubles you need to start? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers Quora User , University Webmaster and Programmer (1999-present) Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 3k answers and 1.3m answer views Assuming the dice are standard six-sided cubes, the odds of any given number are one in six. To find the odds of doubles on a single roll of two dice, consider the dice one at a time. The first die doesn't affect the probability in any way; all it says is which of six equally likely numbers you need from the second die. In other words, no matter which number the first die rolls, there is a one in six chance that the second die will match it, giving you doubles. Of course, that's still not what you asked. To find out how many rolls it is likely to take before you get doubles, a bit more calculation is needed. For this, it helps to consider the odds of getting non -doubles for some number of rolls in a row. That is the number of rolls you have to wait before you get to move. For a single roll, because doubles only have a one-in-six chance, non-doubles have a five in six chance. For multiple rolls, multiply the single-roll probability by itself once for every roll beyond the first. To do that you need to convert five-in-six odds into a number; just divide five by six, which makes 0.8333... with the three repeating forever. For simplicity I'll round that to 0.83, which can also be stated as 83 percent; in other words, you have an 83% chance of not getting doubles on any one roll. So the probability that your first two rolls aren't double is 0.83 times 0.83, or about 69 percent. For three rolls, it's 0.83 times 0.83 times 0.83, which is about a 58 percent chance that you don't get to go in your first three rolls. The probability of four rolls without doubles is about 48 percent, finally less than an even chance. This means you are slightly more likely to get doubles within your first four rolls than you are to have four unsuccessful rolls in a row. Of course this is hardly a guarantee, so let's go on a bit more. Five non-doubles has a 40 percent probability, and for six it's 33 percent. So, one out of every three times I play this game, I'll still be stuck after six rolls. I don't think this would be my favorite game. 937 Views Related Questions More Answers Below How to fix “Screen Overlay Detected” in any android device?

Sarnat , Physician / Anesthesiologist Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 562 answers and 613.1k answer views The chances of rolling a double is 1/6 per roll (6 out of 36 possible outcomes). So the chances of not rolling doubles is 5/6 per roll. A measure of expected number  of rolls is the 50-50 point, for which  you are equally likely to get doubles as not. (5/6)^4 = 0.482, meaning that the chances are 48% of rolling no doubles in 4 rolls, so the chances of rolling at least one double in the first four rolls is 52%.  In other words, in 4 rolls you are slightly more likely than not to get doubles. You can compute it exactly: (5/6)^N=1/2 Take log of both sides, rearrange N = log(1/2) / log(5/6) = approx 3.80 rolls of the dice. Of course, it could take 1000 rolls if you're very unlucky!

I am a member of a grade 5 class in Edmonton, AB. We were talking about probability in math, and I was wanted to know what the probability (odds) of rolling two sixes would be rolling two dice? If it is not to difficult could you tell me what the probability (odds) of rolling any number with two dice were?  Thank You!  Sincerely, Carmen Hi Carmen, First of all we will find how many possible outcomes we have rolling two dice. 
Assume that the first one is Green, the second is Red. Then all possible 
outcomes can be represented in the following table. The numbers in the top row are the possibilities for the red die and the numbers in the first column are the possibilities for the green die. The numbers on the purple background are the sum of the numbers on the red and green dice.    You can see that we have 36 possible outcomes. We are interested only in ONE 
outcome, a 6 on the red die and a 6 on the green die. This gives a total of 12. Thus only one of the 36 possible outcomes has a 6 on both dice and hence the probability of two sixes will be 1 over 36, or 1/36.
Odds in favour 1 to 35, where 35 = 36-1.  For your second question you can read the probabilities off the table. For example suppose you want "the probability of rolling a 4", that is the probability that the sum on the two dice is 4. From the table, there are 3 of the possible 36 outcomes that have a sum of 4. Hence the probability of rolling a 3 is 3/36 = 1/12.

One die rolls a 6.  What is the probability of rolling a double 6?  One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance).  Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1). So the probability of rolling a double six if one six has already been rolled is $\frac{1}{11}$.

second roll. The second roll is independent of the first. So the probability
of a 6 again on the second roll is $1/6.$  If both dice have already been rolled out of your sight, and you are

This doesn't clarify which one. Was it the first die or the second one? (Note that the dice are distinguishable by the turn of their throws.)  So, the latter logic is correct.

Whereas in the one die example, the rolls happen with a small delay in between. – William Falcon  Mar 8 '15 at 18:28        2      You specified the probability of rolling two sixes. On the other hand, the probability of rolling consecutively (one roll, then another), and obtaining the same number twice is $1/6$. The first roll can be any number (probability of rolling a number $1-6$ is equal to $1$, and then the probability of rolling that particular number on the second roll is $\frac 16$ for overall probability of rolling the same number twice being $1/6$. – amWhy  Mar 8 '15 at 18:32         add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Note that you are asking two different questions.  In the first problem, you are asking the probability of rolling a particular number twice, while in the second problem, you are asking the probability of rolling one of the numbers twice.  The probability of rolling a $6$ twice is 
$$\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$$
but so is the probability of rolling a $1$ twice, a $2$ twice, a $3$ twice, a $4$ twice, or a $5$ twice.  Hence, the probability of rolling the same number twice is 
$$6 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 '15 at 1:56       N. F.

This is the way I thought about the problem. Let $X$ be the random variable describing the number of occurrences of a number $a$, where $1 \leq a \leq 6$. Then the probability that $a$ occurs twice is the binomial  $P(X=2) = {5 \choose 2}(\frac{1}{6})^2(\frac{5}{6})^3 = 0.16$  Now there are 6 possibilities for $a$, so the probability of rolling a pair of any number between one and six is $0.16*6 = 0.96$.  I don't know where I went wrong  but the final answer I get seems wrong intuitively to me. I would be grateful for some correction or verification.    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:05             asked Nov 28 '14 at 13:53       Björn   6 3              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote      You can't simply add the probabilities $P(X=2)$ as $a$ ranges over $1,\dots, 6$, since the events of rolling two of a number aren't mutually exclusive (it is possible to roll two ones and two fives). Furthermore, you would want to look at $P(X\ge 2)$, not $P(X=2)$, since having 3 or more of a number also counts as having a matching pair.  I think the best way to do this problem is first find the probability there is no mathcing pair, then subtract from 1. For the dice to be all different, there are 6 choices for the first die, 5 for the second, 4 for the third$\dots$, and $6^5$ possible rolls total, so the probability is
$$
1-\frac{6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2}{6^5}

If you want to add the probabilities of getting your pair rather than subtracting the probability of not getting a pair, you have to avoid double-counting.
As has already been mentioned, you can roll two $1$s and two $2$s in the same five rolls.
To compute the probability of exactly two $1$s and no other pairs,
you have $5$ choices for the first die that is not in the pair, but for each of those
there remain only $4$ choices for the next die, and at the end there are
only $3$ choices for the last die, so
$$P(\mbox{pair of twos}) = 
\binom52 \left(\frac16\right)^2 \cdot \frac56 \cdot \frac 46 \cdot \frac 36.$$
This event is mutually exclusive from having a pair of $2$s, so now it is OK to
multiply by $6$ to find the probability of having exactly one pair of exactly one number.  If you want at least one pair, then you must also add the probability of
having exactly one pair each of two different numbers
and the probability of having three or more of a single number
(which you could further subdivide into exactly three, exactly four, or five
of the same number).
This is much more tedious and error-prone than the method of subtracting the
probability of no pairs.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:37       David K   44.4k 3 35 95              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      I'm going to assume you're asking for the probability that there is at least one pair, not exactly one pair. These are of course different questions. The probability that there are no matching pairs given five dice rolled is
$$P=1\cdot\frac56\cdot\frac46\cdot\frac36\cdot\frac26=\frac5{54}.$$
The probability that there is at least one pair is $1-P=\frac{49}{54}$.  It isn't too much more difficult to work out the probability that there is exactly one pair. By symmetry and mutual exclusion, this is six times the probability that the number $a$ appears exactly twice and there are no other pairs. This is given by
$$Q=\frac{{5\choose{2}}\cdot{5\choose3}\cdot3!}{6^5}=\frac{25}{6\cdot54}$$
and so the probability is $\frac{25}{54}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:55             answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:12       Jason   11.6k 1 8 29                  Should that be $\binom53$ rather than $\binom43$ in the calculation of $Q$?

Imagine the dice are coloured blue, white, and red. Record the outcome as a triple $(b,w,r)$, where $b$ is the number on the blue, and so on. There are $6^3$ possible outcomes, all equally likely.  How many doubles are there? The number we have two of can be chosen in $6$ ways. For each choice, the number we have one of can be chosen in $5$ ways, and its location (colour) can be chosen in $3$ ways, for a total of $(6)(5)(3)$. the required probability is therefore $\frac{(6)(5)(3)}{6^3}$.  Another way: The probability all the tosses are the same is $\frac{1}{36}$, since whatever we get on the blue, we must get on the white and on the red.  The probability the tosses are all different is $\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{4}{6}$. So the probability of not getting a double is $\frac{1}{36}+\frac{20}{36}$. It follows that the probability of a double is $\frac{15}{36}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 14 '13 at 1:20             answered Oct 13 '13 at 20:47       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      $\displaystyle{%

Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with the first and second die is 6/36, or 1/6.  There is also a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the first and third die.  And a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the second and third die.  Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with all three dice is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 or 1/2 (including triples).  The probability of rolling triples is 1/36 so the probability of rolling doubles with no triples is 18/36 - 1/36 = 17/36.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 21 '17 at 19:43       user494128   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

By contrast, the situation "one dice shows a 4, the other shows a 1" can occur in two ways - either the first dice is 4 and the second is 1, or the first dice is 1 and the second is 4.  The easiest way to convince yourself of this is to tabulate all 36 possibilities:  1 1    1 2    1 3    1 4    1 5    1 6
