Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

McDonald University of Delaware    Introduction  Arm folding  Asparagus urine  Attached earlobe  Beeturia  Bent pinkie  Cheek dimples  Cleft chin  Darwin's tubercle  Earwax  Eye color  Hair color  Hair whorl  Hand clasping  Hitchhiker's thumb  Mid-digital hair  PTC tasting  Toe length  Tongue rolling  Widow's peak    Eye color: The myth  One of the oldest myths in human genetics is that having blue eyes is determined by a single gene, with the allele for blue eyes recessive to the allele for non-blue eyes (green, brown, or hazel). Many people who know nothing else about genetics think that two blue-eyed parents cannot have a brown-eyed child.   The reality  Eye color as a character  The color of the iris is determined by the amount of melanin, the ratio of eumelanin (which is dark brown) to pheomelanin (which is reddish), and the way the melanin is distributed in the eye. Irises with little melanin appear blue due to scattering of light by collagen fibers in the iris. Blue, gray, green and hazel eyes are only common in people of European ancestry; other people's eyes are various shades of brown.  Many studies divide eye colors into three categories: blue (or blue and gray); green and hazel; and brown. This has been criticized as an oversimplification (Brues 1975), and eye colors have been divided into nine categories (Mackey et al. 2011) or the hue and saturation values quantified (Liu et al. 2010). Eye color can change dramatically in the first few years of life, as many babies are born with blue eyes but then develop green or brown eyes (Matheny and Dolan 1975), and changes can also occur later in life (Bito et al. 1997, Liu et al. 2010). Some people have a blue or green iris with a brown ring around the pupil (Sturm and Larsson 2009), which makes the classification of eye color even more complicated.  Family studies  Davenport and Davenport (1907) were the first to suggest that blue eye color was caused by a recessive allele. They claimed that whenever both parents had blue eyes, all of the children have blue eyes, but their data actually included two hazel-eyed offspring of blue-eyed parents. The authors said "we suspect [these] to be of a blue type," whatever that means.  Hurst (1908) divided eyes into just two types, "simplex" (blues and some grays, with no pigment on the outer surface of the iris) and "duplex" (all other colors). He found the following results:    Parents  Duplex offspring  Simplex offspring    Duplex x Duplex  240  18    Duplex x Simplex  187  137    Simplex x Simplex  0  101    Because there are no "duplex" (non-blue-eyed) offspring of two blue-eyed parents, these data fit the model of blue eyes being caused by a recessive allele at one gene.  Holmes and Loomis (1909) criticized the earlier work, saying that eye color varies continuously, and dividing it into categories is arbitrary. Out of 52 offspring of two blue-eyed parents in their data, one had brown eyes and two had gray eyes, which does not fit the idea that blue eyes are caused by a recessive allele. Boas (1918) found an even larger number of non-blue-eyed offspring of two blue-eyed parents, 26 out of 223. Surprisingly, there don't seem to have been any parent-offspring studies of eye color since then, at least none that I could find.  Molecular genetics  A number of groups surveyed associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with eye color, with fairly consistent results: variation in the HERC2 and OCA2 genes, which are next to each other on chromosome 15, plays a major role in determining eye color. However, variation in at least 10 other genes, plus complicated interactions between these genes, also influences eye color (reviewed in Sturm and Larsson 2009, with more recent results in Liu et al. 2010 and Pospiech et al. 2011).   Conclusion  Eye color is not an example of a simple genetic trait, and blue eyes are not determined by a recessive allele at one gene. Instead, eye color is determined by variation at several different genes and the interactions between them, and this makes it possible for two blue-eyed parents to have brown-eyed children.

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Eye Colors Around the World: How Rare is Your Eye Color?   June 9, 2017 What's In Style      79   0        0               Eyes are such a unique characteristic that people have. Eyes range in different colors, some that are very common and some that are quite rare. Here are some of the most common and rarest eye colors found around the world.  Brown Eyes  With brown-eye people making up more than 55% of the global population, brown eyes are the most common eye color amongst people. In fact, nearly all members of the African and Asian population share brown eyes. This is because of it being a dominant genetic trait due to melanin existing in the eye.  Blue Eyes  While brown eyes are genetically dominant, blue eye color is recessive genetic trait, which makes them much less common amongst people. Blue eye color exists because there is an absence of pigments, and blue eyes appear from the scattered light reflected off of the iris. Although less common than brown eyes, about 8% of people in the world have blue eyes. They can often be found in people in northern Europe.  Hazel Eyes  While hazel eyes have similarities to brown eyes, they are usually a lighter color with more of a green and yellow tint. Hazel eyes are created because there is higher concentrated melanin around the border of the pupil than the rest of the iris. This results in the appearance of a multi-colored iris that ranges from copper to green in certain lights. Approximately 5-8% of people in the world have hazel eyes.  Green Eyes  Green eyes can often be mistaken for hazel eyes, but they are two completely different eye colors. In addition, green eyes are one of the rarest eye colors found worldwide with only 2% of people having green eyes. Green eyes occur because of a mild amount of melanin, a burst a lipochrome, and a golden tint. The golden tint mixes with a natural base of blue to create the green color. Green eye people most frequently live in northern and central Europe, but western Asia can also be a place where it is found.  Silver Eyes  Often, silver colored eyes are considered to be a variation of blue eyes. However, they are a rare eye color that still look distinct from blue eyes. Like blue colored eyes, silver is created due to low pigmentation in the eyes. Though quite rare, silver eyes can be found most frequently in eastern Europe.  Black Eyes  Although there are some people with eyes as dark as night, this is not true black. It is actually just extremely dark brown. This happens because of a significantly higher concentration of melanin throughout the iris. Often with this eye color, it is even difficult to distinguish between the pupil and the iris.  Red or Pink Eyes  Red or pink colored eyes can be a result of albinism or blood leaking into the iris. Albino people often have extremely light blue eye from lack of pigmentation, but certain forms of albinism causes a red or pink eye color instead.  Amber Eyes  Amber colored eyes are a very rare find around the world, but they are most common in Asia and South America. This eye color can vary from a golden yellow to more of a copper color. While amber eyes are frequently confused with hazel eyes, the difference is that hazel has brown and green while amber is a single color. The high amount of lipochrome gives the appearance of glowing eyes. This eye color is found more in animals than in humans.  Violet Eyes  This is another rare eye color typically found in people with albinism. In fact, it is believed that truly violet eyes cannot exist with having albinism.

Eye Colors Around the World: How Rare is Your Eye Color?   June 9, 2017 What's In Style      79   0        0               Eyes are such a unique characteristic that people have. Eyes range in different colors, some that are very common and some that are quite rare. Here are some of the most common and rarest eye colors found around the world.  Brown Eyes  With brown-eye people making up more than 55% of the global population, brown eyes are the most common eye color amongst people. In fact, nearly all members of the African and Asian population share brown eyes. This is because of it being a dominant genetic trait due to melanin existing in the eye.  Blue Eyes  While brown eyes are genetically dominant, blue eye color is recessive genetic trait, which makes them much less common amongst people. Blue eye color exists because there is an absence of pigments, and blue eyes appear from the scattered light reflected off of the iris. Although less common than brown eyes, about 8% of people in the world have blue eyes. They can often be found in people in northern Europe.  Hazel Eyes  While hazel eyes have similarities to brown eyes, they are usually a lighter color with more of a green and yellow tint. Hazel eyes are created because there is higher concentrated melanin around the border of the pupil than the rest of the iris. This results in the appearance of a multi-colored iris that ranges from copper to green in certain lights. Approximately 5-8% of people in the world have hazel eyes.  Green Eyes  Green eyes can often be mistaken for hazel eyes, but they are two completely different eye colors. In addition, green eyes are one of the rarest eye colors found worldwide with only 2% of people having green eyes. Green eyes occur because of a mild amount of melanin, a burst a lipochrome, and a golden tint. The golden tint mixes with a natural base of blue to create the green color. Green eye people most frequently live in northern and central Europe, but western Asia can also be a place where it is found.  Silver Eyes  Often, silver colored eyes are considered to be a variation of blue eyes. However, they are a rare eye color that still look distinct from blue eyes. Like blue colored eyes, silver is created due to low pigmentation in the eyes. Though quite rare, silver eyes can be found most frequently in eastern Europe.  Black Eyes  Although there are some people with eyes as dark as night, this is not true black. It is actually just extremely dark brown. This happens because of a significantly higher concentration of melanin throughout the iris. Often with this eye color, it is even difficult to distinguish between the pupil and the iris.  Red or Pink Eyes  Red or pink colored eyes can be a result of albinism or blood leaking into the iris. Albino people often have extremely light blue eye from lack of pigmentation, but certain forms of albinism causes a red or pink eye color instead.  Amber Eyes  Amber colored eyes are a very rare find around the world, but they are most common in Asia and South America. This eye color can vary from a golden yellow to more of a copper color. While amber eyes are frequently confused with hazel eyes, the difference is that hazel has brown and green while amber is a single color. The high amount of lipochrome gives the appearance of glowing eyes. This eye color is found more in animals than in humans.  Violet Eyes  This is another rare eye color typically found in people with albinism. In fact, it is believed that truly violet eyes cannot exist with having albinism. Violet eyes occurs from mixing lack of pigment and red from light reflecting off of blood vessels within the eyes.  While not all of us have these eye colors, you can still make your pair look good with our glasses!

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Dominant vs. Recessive          Back to Dominant vs. Recessive           English   Español       Which parent gives you the most dominant genes?        -An undergraduate from Indiana   October 12, 2011  Except for a few special cases (see below), it doesn't really matter which parent gave you which gene. If a gene version is dominant, it will dominate whether it came from mom or dad.  So your chances of getting a dominant trait don't depend on which parent it came from. If mom gives you the dominant brown eye version of an eye color gene, odds are you'll end up with brown eyes. Same thing if dad passes the same gene. In neither case would you have higher odds for getting brown eyes.  Now that isn't to say that if mom has brown eyes then all her kids will too. They could end up with the other parent's recessive blue or green eyes. Or an eye color that neither parent has!  This is how brown-eyed parents end up with a blue-eyed child. Or how two parents who don't have red hair have a redheaded baby.  As you can see, genetics is a complicated business. But one thing we do know...no one is more likely to favor one parent over the other. Which traits you get depend on the combination of genes you get from both parents.  What I'll do for the rest of the answer is explain a bit about how genes work. Then I'll focus on some situations where the parents do matter. As you'll see, this is usually when a trait is on the X chromosome.   Dominant and Recessive  Let's say that a child has a mom with brown eyes and dad with blue eyes. Since brown eyes are dominant, the mom can have either one brown (B) and one blue (b) version of an eye color gene or she can have two browns. As geneticists like to say, she can be either Bb or BB.  To make things easier, we will say that she is BB (both genes are the brown version). Since the dad has blue eyes, he has two copies of the recessive blue version. He is bb.  Each parent will pass one copy of their eye color gene to their child. In this case, the mom will always pass B and the dad will always pass b. This means all of their kids will be Bb and have brown eyes. Each child will show the mom's dominant trait.  Now if we flip things around where the father has two brown versions (BB) and the mom has two blue ones (bb), the child will still end up Bb and having brown eyes. It doesn't matter if B came from mom or dad. It only mattered that the child got a B.  I don't want you to think that if one parent shows the dominant trait, all their children will too. They may not. Let me give another eye color example to show you what I mean.  Imagine a mom with one version of the brown and one version of the blue eye color gene. She is Bb and has brown eyes. Dad is bb and has blue eyes.  These are the same eye colors that the parents had in the first example. But the result could turn out very differently.  The kids each have a 50% chance of having mom's brown eyes and a 50% chance of having dad's blue eyes. (This is because mom has a 50% chance of passing her B and a 50% chance of passing her b.) So in this case, the kids can end up with mom's dominant trait or dad's recessive one. Which one is a simple matter of chance.*  And if we take a Bb dad (brown eyes) and a bb mother (blue eyes), there is still a 50% chance for the child to have blue eyes. Again it didn't matter which parent gave which gene version. What was important is that these two gene versions were involved.  This is true for many, many traits besides eye color. But not all of them. Sometimes it matters whether your mom or dad has a dominant trait.   Blame (or Thank) Mom Through our discussion so far, you may have picked up on the fact that we have two copies of our genes - one from mom and one from dad. But this isn't true for every gene.   Red-green colorblindness (II) is one of the few traits where it matters which parent the gene came from.  Whether you are a boy or a girl mostly depends on whether you have an X and a Y chromosome or two X's. If you have an X and a Y, then you are a boy. If you have two X's, then you are a girl.  This matters for our discussion because it means that girls (and so moms) have two copies of all the genes on the X chromosome while boys (and dads) have just one. The genes on mom's X chromosome will dominate for her sons whether they are dominant or recessive. Let's look at color blindness as an example to figure out why.  Imagine that mom is colorblind. Since being colorblind is recessive, she has two copies of the color blind version of the gene (c). Geneticists say she is Xc Xc because the recessive version is on the X chromosome.  In our case, dad isn't color blind. Since he has just one X chromosome, he has a single copy of the version of the gene that lets him tell red from green. He is XC Y. (The XC means he has the dominant version of the color vision gene on his X. The Y has no color vision gene on it and so is here as a marker.)  OK, now what happens when these two parents have sons? They are all colorblind like their mother. Her recessive trait dominates!  Let me take you through how this happened. Since the child is a boy, we know dad passed his Y (otherwise the child would be a girl). This doesn't contribute any color vision genes.  Mom will pass one of her Xc's to her son. The son now has an Xc and a Y. He has no dominant color vision gene version to overcome his color blind version and so is color blind like his mother. Every son will have that trait.  Colorblindness is one of a few special traits where it matters which parent a gene copy came from. For most traits it doesn't matter. What matters is the combination of genes you get no matter the source.  * As we talk about here , it is also possible for the child to have green, hazel or any other eye color.

It doesn't matter if brown eyes come from mom or dad. If you get the gene you'll have brown eyes.

Animated video shows the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

Will your new baby start with the classic blue eyes? And will they stay that way? Despite what you may have been taught, eye color inheritance is very complicated. We'll walk you through the odds that your child will inherit your eye colour, and your sight problems. We'll also cover some wild traits, like a pair of eyes with two different colors, albinism, and even purple eyes. Here's what you need to know!  15 Not as Simple as It Sounds                     Advertising [x]        Perhaps you once heard that eye color is determined by one gene, and that brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes so that if a child has the genetics for both colors they'll always end up with brown eyes. Well, scientists have found that eye color is much more complicated than we originally thought. There are at least four, and there may be fifteen or more, genes that contribute to eye color and so we can't predict with certainty what a child will inherit. Yet, this new complexity in eye color genetics allows for some interesting possibilities: two blue-eyed parents can have a brown-eyed child just like two brown-eyed parents can have a blue-eyed child. Let's start with some specifics.  14 The Eye "Ring"                     Advertising [x]        The iris is the colored part of the eye and is found all around the black pupil. The iris is the muscle that contracts to adjust the size of the pupil, changing how much light gets into the eye. Yet, there is another part of the eye that's important for color: the Limbal ring. It's a dark ring around the iris. Your child's will likely be very distinct, but they do tend to get smaller and lighter with age - while on some people they are imperceptible. As they get smaller and lighter, the color of your eyes appear to lighten with them.  13 Some Children Are Born with Blue Eyes                     Advertising [x]        Children with light skin will likely be born with blue eyes. This is because the same substance that produces skin colour, melanin, also produces eye colour. Children with less melanin will have blue eyes that can change colour until about three years old. These parents will have to play a waiting game to know for sure what colour their child's eyes will be, but, of course, they may remain blue.  12 Heterochromia: Two Different Colored Eyes                     Some babies are born with, or develop, two different eye colors. If you notice this, be sure to mention it to your doctor as it may be a sign of Horner's Syndrome, which can be serious. There are other causes of heterochromia including: trauma in the womb, inflammation, chimerism, another (harmless) genetic disorder, or a freckle on one iris. The freckle is usually harmless, especially in young people, and may make for all kinds of odd or beautiful eyes.  11 Blue Eyes                     If you love blue eyes you'll be disappointed to know that predicting them is now very complicated, with the ten or so genes involved. But, we know how the two major genes in eye colour genetics work, and if you and your partner both have blue eyes you're likely to pass it on. If one of you has brown eyes your chances are much slimmer, probably around twenty-five per cent. They do improve somewhat, to about fifty per cent, if the brown-eyes parent carries a recessive gene for blue eyes. You're more likely to carry this recessive blue eyed gene if your siblings and/or your parents have blue eyes, but its no guarantee. Also, it's still possible to have a brown eyed child, even if both you and your partner have light eyes.  10 Grey Eyes                     Advertising [x]        Grey eyes aren't an urban myth, but they are a mystery. There are a few theories as to what makes eyes grey. Some think that grey eyes have even less melanin than blue eyes, while others think that the shape of the eye is different, so the light is refracted at a different angle, which changes the colour. But, because no one knows what causes this eye colour no one can predict if your child will have grey eyes or not.  9 Green Eyes                     So far we've talked about melanin as though it's only one thing, but there are actually two types of melanin in humans: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is dark and responsible for dark skin and dark eye colour. Pheomelanin is yellow, and is responsible for green eye colour. Why green? When yellow light refracts through the shape of the human eye it turns green. Its the same reason that the sky is blue, as the light changes angles when it moves through the atmosphere and becomes blue. Green eyes aren't very likely, but they are common to both Irish and German ancestries.

Brown eyes are the result of high levels of eumelanin. regardless of the level of pheomelanin, as eumelanin usually cancels it out as far as colour is concerned. If you have brown eyes you're likely to pass them on, although its not impossible for your child to have other eye colors. If you feel like brown eyes are a little overlooked, don't worry, people actually find them more youthful than other eye colors and so they receive their fair share of adoration.  7 Hazel Eyes                     Advertising [x]        These eyes are a simple mixture between blue and green eyes, or between eumelanin and pheomelanin. The mixture explains why the eye sometimes appears more green, and sometimes appears more brown, as lighting conditions or surrounding colors emphasize one melanin or the other.  6 Amber Eyes                     Keeping in mind that human eye colour occurs on a spectrum, amber eyes are a variant of brown eyes. These eyes appear in stunning shades of warm browns to almost honey yellow. However, little is certain about how this eye colour is formed, never mind how it is passed on.  5 Purple Eyes                     Although there's a popular myth that purple, or violet eyes exist, they don't. The myth also argues that people with purple eyes also have super human gifts, so its no surprise that the myth originated in fan fiction.  4 Red Eyes: Albinism                     Advertising [x]        This is a very rare condition that results in very light, even seemingly pure white, hair and skin colour. Sometimes the eyes of people with albinism can appear red, because in some lighting the blood vessels at the back of eye can be seen due to the total lack of melanin. Otherwise the eyes appear blue, or even darker colors depending on the type of albinism. Though children with albinism are usually born to parents without it, and though albinism can occur in any ethnicity, only one in 17,000 Americans have albinism. Your child is very unlikely to be born with albinism.  3 Will Your Child Need Glasses?                     There are other eye genetics that you could pass onto your child, including the need for glasses. Both nearsightedness and farsightedness are very likely to be determined by genetics, but the inheritance isn't cut and dry. Research from 2013 suggests that there is a strong environmental component to nearsightedness, including a lack of natural light during a child's eye development, making its occurrence hard to predict. It's best to get your child's eyes checked as they begin school, and frequently as they grow.  2 Color Blindness                     Those who are color blind were usually born with it and are more often boys than girls. The genes for red/green and blue colour blindness are carried on the X chromosome, so when a girl inherits this gene they usually have a healthy second X chromosome that prevents the color blindness. Men, however, have a Y chromosome instead and will be color blind if they have one copy of color blindness genes. Your son will have a chance of being color blind if their maternal grandfather was. For sons, the father's genes don't matter as the father only passes on a Y chromosome. On the other hand, your daughter may become a carrier if her father is color blind, because he does pass down an X chromosome to her.  1 Other Hereditary Blindness                     Blindness is very unlikely. For example, only five out of a thousand children will be born with cataracts, which cause blindness without treatment . Despite the low odds, it is important to bring any concerns you have about your child's sight to your doctor. Surgery for congenital eye cataracts should and can be done before the child is four months old, which will prevent the child from becoming blind. The sooner any potential sight issue is caught, the less of an affect it may have on your child's development.

(Click to expand) Image by Mike DeHaan  Although the main question expectant parents ask is, ‘Will my baby be healthy?’ it’s also fun to ask other questions – such as, ‘What eye color will my baby have?’  Baby Eye Color Predictor  How can we predict a baby’s eye color?  We expect that a Caucasian baby will have gray or blue eyes at birth, since the color pigments have not yet developed fully, and usually African and Asian babies have brown eyes from birth.  By nine months, most Caucasian babies settle into their adult color: blue, brown, green or hazel. Some children will change eye color all the way up to age three, so don’t get too comfortable with your baby’s eye color until he or she is in preschool, it could still change!  Regardless of the eye color your baby ends up with later on, but before he or she is born, there’s no way to know for sure. Can you The question, however, is to predict your child’s eye color before birth, based on the parent’s genetic legacy? Let’s start with the classic “blue versus brown” match-up, and deal with the simplest situation.  ________________  Would you like to see more articles like this?

Each gene consists of a pair of alleles . Each parent donates one allele, so the child inherits a pair of alleles. The chart in the image above is a essentially a Punnett square.  A person with two dominant brown alleles, ‘ BB ‘, will have brown eyes. Another, with two recessive blue alleles, ‘ bb ‘, will have blue eyes. The brown dominance means that a mixed gene, ‘ Bb ‘, will be expressed as brown-eyed. Two blue-eyed people will have a blue-eyed child. Since the parents must each have a ‘bb’ gene, they can only pass ‘b’ alleles to the next generation. However, brown-eyed parents have either a ‘Bb’ or a ‘BB’ gene. You only know that a brown-eyed person has a mixed ‘Bb’ allele if that person had one blue-eyed parent.  From the chart, we can see that a child with brown-eyed parents has one chance in eight, or 12.5%, of being blue-eyed; and then only if one parent has some possible blue-eyed ancestry. Again, a mix of blue-eyed and brown-eyed parents has a “2/8=1/4=25%” chance of a blue-eyed child.  However, there is no guarantee that the situation will be quite this simple. Hazel and green eye color can both result from a weaker “brown” contribution.  Blue Eyed, Brown Eyed, Hazel or Green?  When you’re pregnant, it’s natural to wonder what your new baby’s eyes will be like, not to mention whether you’re having a boy or a girl , or how tall will she be . Although there’s no way to know for sure, you can use math to calculate the chances of brown eyes vs. blue, and more. © Copyright 2013 Mike DeHaan: Math, All rights Reserved.

Reply        jackie  says:    May 28, 2014 at 7:54 pm     Youre an idiot. Recessive genes dont run out. Each child has equal opportunity to have a recessive eye color. And it just happened to work out the way it did. Just against odds, and entirely possible. Try taking biology again.

I am pretty sure our baby will just have brown eyes. Brown is pretty dominant and with your husband having only brown eyed parents, I don't think its likely recessive genes like colored eyes will show up over that. But there's a chance you could be surprised! I'm sure your baby will be adorable no matter what :) Reply  Close M  Miramarsol My brother sent me a video of different percentages.

If you have a recessive blue gene hidden somewhere it could be blue. Otherwise I'm afraid it'll be brown. Reply  Close c  cassie77775 Brown Is dominant so Big chance they will be Brown. I have brown and hubby Has a bluish green. Oldest son has Bluish green, middle has blue and littlest has blue. No brown eyes whatsoever so my best guess is my moms blue eyes got passed down instead of my dads brown.

Somehow all 3 of their boys came out with blue eyes. I'm married to their blue eyed middle son & I have brown eyes as well (I'm black) and our 2yr old has bright blue eyes! Reply  Close P  Pumi7 @Kb2129  Green is a mutation. My mother has green eyes and her parents had blue and brown, so the 0% on that chart is totally incorrect. Reply  Close s  sadabug I have brown eyes and I'm mostly Croatian. We just had our 3rd child this past December and he was my first brown eyed baby. My son has beautiful blue eyes. My daughter has a rare eye condition where she doesn't really have any irises. However, there is a slight rim and it appears to be blue as well. My husband has beautiful green eyes. I'm hoping this boy will have his daddy's eyes. Then I'll have one of each color and a black eyed child (due to the Aniridia). Reply  Close g  genevieve127 I think they have discovered now that eye color has a lot more genetics than originally thought. It has something to do with the amount of melanin that you are born with. My husband I both have brown eyes and really dark hair. Our son came out blonde haired and blue eyed and he is 100% ours we didn't let him out of our sight at the hospital lol. It's a total gamble. I'm curios what this one is going to look like will we have 2 children that look nothing like us? Haha Reply  Close n  nshelton16 My husband & I both have very very dark brown eyes, he is Mexican also so his whole family has brown eyes. I'm half black, half white & all of my siblings have brown eyes. However my mom has hazel eyes & her father, my grandfather has blue eyes. Well our daughter came out with blue eyes (to everyone's surprise!) & around 15 months they switched to green. They're amazing. But a lot of people ask how it happened & we're still not sure other than maybe some recessive genes from my mothers side. So anything is possible!

My husbands family is all blue eyes and I'm pretty sure my family has brown eyes unfortunately I'm not 100% sure about my family since I was removed when I was a toddler. So I guess it can go both ways. Reply  Close E  Ejoynerk @nshelton16  Wow that is amazing! Reply  Close K  Kb2129 @Pumi7  Yeah, that makes sense! I know my husband has no melanin in his eye (I think that's what he said). When he has eye appointments the eye docs are always fascinated to see his eyes because usually people have a little. His is completely empty. He has the light blue eyes. And here I have dark, brown eyes, which I think means I have a lot of melanin in my eyes? Makes sense for our daughter's eyes to be somewhere between since we are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. I am curious to see what babe #2 has! Reply  Close m  mollmill0 @Pumi7  Agreed! My mom has blue, my dad has brown. I have green! My dad's mother had green also.

I have brown/green eyes and DH has blue. At 11 weeks, our girls still have a deeper blue. I'm hoping they stay blue but we'll see what happens. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  10 Posts a  alifix @DoubleUnicornPoo  I'm wondering this too. Our girls are 16 weeks and I swear they're a different shade every day & also look different depending on the light. Some days they still look blue, and yet from other angles they look green/brown. I think babies have up until 6 months till their final color should be dominant. k  kseds @DoubleUnicornPoo  My babies were all born with blue eyes - they never changed colour. My eyes are blue, and my husband's range from grey to green depending on what colour he is wearing! D  DoubleUnicornPoo @kseds  Yeah. DH's are this crazy pale blue but they'll be more blue some days and more gray others depending on what he's wearing and the light. Apparently growing up, him and his siblings always bothered their mom with who had the best eyes (all 3 had blue) and one day his mom gave in and said he did. Well, when his niece was born, she took the "best eyes in the family" crown. So obviously he's hoping to get that back to our girls instead of his sister's daughter. Oh the sibling rivalry never ends! :-) m  miracleprincebabies @DoubleUnicornPoo  My oldest was born with bright blue eyes. My eyes are brown and my husband has hazel. By the time she was six they turned gray and now she is 14 and they change from hazel, green, gray, and a hint of blue lol. K  Kraiford My son's eyes were blue at birth and changed to hazel after about three weeks and still are at 4, my daughter was born with brown eyes and they never changed. d  dsirish My daughter's eyes lightened from a dark blue into a pretty icy blue like my husband's around 5 mos. I know that brown is a dominant trait, and blue (eyes) is recessive, but I'm not sure about changes from blue to brown. My cousin's daughter's eyes were brown when born, the lightened into bright blue after a few mos. J  Jamiex6 I have one kid with blue, two with brown, and three with hazel.  It was clear from early on that my blue eyed baby would be blue and my brown eyed babies would be brown.  The hazel took longer to develop and kind of looked like a muddled grey as babies. m  merryjlewis I have brown eyes (with a 50% chance of a recessive blue gene) and my ex husband has green eyes (his parents and brother all have blue).  Our 10 yr old son was born with blue eyes.  Normally they say that if they're going to go brown they do so within the first year.  But when he was 1 they changed to green, when he was 2 they changed to grey, and it wasn't til he was between 3 and 4 that they finally deepened to brown.  Right now I'm 21w with identical twins with my new husband (who has blue eyes), so I'm wondering if it will follow a similar pattern. D  DoubLL My DH has dark brown eyes. His mom has bright blue eyes. I have light brown eyes and my dad has bright blue eyes. With my twins my dd has my brown eyes and our ds has bright blue eyes! Their dr said that most likely he will keep his blue eyes. He said as long as both parents carry the recessive blue gene then it is a possibility. He is almost 15 weeks.

Keep in mind that my dad has black hair and brownish eyes with tan skin. Any Indian and white couples?! Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  293 Posts K  KingsMommie Yes it's possible for your daughter  to have blue eyes.  She could have a recessive gene.  I'm blk (dark brown eyes) hubby is white (blue/green eyes) and our son was born with dark grey eyes that have gone to blue to blueish/grey to more of a grey now. He's 1.5 yrs old. I never thought I'd have a baby with eyes any color than brown L  Leyla28 @brexie  Same here except that my husband is Pakistani. Well, our two kids are proper Pakistani (no blue eyes :-()... I also wonder how this LO will be like. But it seems that the Pakistani genes are way stronger than mine :-) H  Hubbinator Blue eyes are recessive, that means it takes two recessive genes for them to occur. One recessive gene from you, one from your husband. If your daughter gets a recessive blue eyed gene from you and a dominate brown eyed gene from her dad, she will have brown eyes. k  kmezanava2135782723 @mcgeelisha  my daughter has blue eyes and brown hair. I'm white (blonde/green eyes) and husband is Mexican and Puerto Rican S  SarahChron @brexie  Both parents need to have blue eyes in the family. Both my parents had brown eyes. I ended up with blue because both grandmothers and one grandpa had blue eyes. Blue is represented with bb and Brown is represented with BB. So if both couple carry a b the it's likely for a baby to get bb. However if one parent does not carry a b and only BB the likely your baby can only be BB = brown or Bb =brown which in the case dominant gene rules. My husband is Asian I am Caucasian. Our children will never have blue eyes because he only has BB. However they may have lighter brown not so black. And of course they may be Bb so when they have children and marry someone with b then can have blue eyed grand babies hehehe H  Hubbinator @kmezanava2135782723  So somewhere along the line your husband inherited a recessive blue eyed gene. Really, not uncommon. My husband is from Brazil and our son ended up with blue eyes because there is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of Italian in him that gave him a recessive blue eyed gene. G  Gmom0218 @mcgeelisha  I am Vietnamese and DH is caucasian with red hair and hazel eyes. I must have some French in me b/c our son has the same coloring as daddy. He was born with blue eyes that turned hazel but his hair has stayed red. It can happen! 1  10bacon4 @mcgeelisha  My husband is Mexican and Portuguese with very dark brown eyes and I'm caucasian with blue eyes. At a year old our son's eyes are exactly the same blue as mine. We are definitely surprised since both my parents and his parents have brown eyes. n  nolechick429 @brexie  I'm Filipina and husband is Caucasian. Our 6 month old daughter has bright blue eyes. It skipped 5 generations on my side but it showed up eventually:) l  llotsoflove I'm white with hazel eyes and BF is black. He does not know of anyone on his side with blue but my Mothers family all have blue eyes. Our second son has beautiful blue grey eyes at 3 months old :) k  katedgd its nothing to do with indianess--do either of his parents or grandparents have light eyes? babes need 1 gene from eah side ti= e  etoledo3 I'm Cuban and my husband is puerto rican, we both have brown eyes. Our oldest son who's 9 has blue eyes. My grandparents had blue eyes on my dads side and my husband had to have blue eyes on his side of the family. Funny thing is that each of my siblings has one child with blue eyes. a  ana_karen so im full Mexican brown hair brown eyes. my hubby is half Mexican (dad) and half caucasian (mom) he has medium light brown eyes and hair. now one of my grampas gas hazel greenish eyes, my hubbys brother has hazel eyes as well. is there a chance my daughter can have colored eyes? 7  78renegade @brexie  Over the last couple of years scientists have discovered that there are MULTIPLE genes responsible for eye color so the old idea of using the punnet square (scientific equation involving mixing alleles, or more commonly known a dominant and recessive trait) apply to only each INDIVIDUAL gene. What this means is that it is possible for the blue eyes to come through. The information posted on here is somewhat true but a little outdated! Don't believe me --- google it! a  ayla_bean There is a possibility that your LO could have a combination of you and your mans eyes. My mother has really green eyes almost a blue and my biological father had dark brown, I can out with hazel eyes. Me and my bf are due in march and he is Indian and I am white, but because he has a bit of German in his family our baby could even come out with blue eyes. M  MonikaSk @brexie  This depends on the father, if your father passed on a "recessive light eye color" to you, your mother would have passed on one too. I would assume your dad is not 100% since he has recessive blue eyes jeans not a trait in that culture and it can from somewhere. It maybe way down line. (It's genealogy) now if your child's father has no recessive eye color jeans the dark will dominate the light. Such as it would be a constant dominate/recessive pairing & the dark will dominate. My parents have brown eyes, but both my grandmothers had blue. My sister has green eyes, I have brown, my husband has hazel & so does our daughter. So I am carrying a recessive jean. M  Mommysteinpfad It is possible if your baby's dad has a parent with blue eyes. If you out eye color into their alleles brown eyes=BB (both parents have brown eyes) or Bb(one parent has brown eyes and one parents has blue, which is what your child's alleles will be if she has brown eyes) and blue eyes=bb. So depending on your so alleles your daughters will be either Bb=she will have brown eyes or bb= your daughter will have blue eyes. If your so alleles are BB (both of his parents have brown eyes) your daughter will only get Bb alleles meaning she can only have brown eyes. C  Cevanne @brexie  Your dark eyes parent carried a recessive gene and a dominance one. Blue eyes must have 2 recessives. So your dad Bb. You bb. Your husband does not likely carry any recessive genes unless there has been an infusion somewhere in his families history. So he's probably BB. That means that your kids will probably be Bb. Sorry!!! So hazel or brown. My husbands family is Asian and both my kids ended up with his beautiful brown eyes. t  tambo_rambo83 Eye color is not simply determined by dominant recessive genetics! There are multiple alleles involved on 15 genes. It's much more complex than what people think ;) Related Articles & Discussions Baby Olympians Take Home Awards At Pittsburgh Hospital  Best Napper.

How it works           The determination of the eye color of an individual is a complex and fascinating phenomenon, especially when the birth of a new child approaches.  What color would my child's eyes be?  What are his chances of having brown, blue or green eyes?  The following answers are simplified explanations, the determination of the eye color of an individual depends on much more parameters than those cited below.  This method of calculation takes into account only three theoretical eye colors: brown, green and blue.
					
					The results given by this calculator are an estimate of the chance of having a child with the eyes of one of these three colors.  Two principal genes are detected as determinants for eye color: EYCL3 (localized on chromosome 15) and EYCL1 (localized on chromosome 19).
					
					The EYCL3 gene determines the amount of melanin present in our eye color, light eyes or dark eyes. Its value can be: B (Brown) or b (blue).					
					The EYCL1 gene determines the blue color or green color of our eyes.
					Its value may be: G (Green) or b (blue).  On each chromosome, we have two different alleles that come from our mother AND our father.  These genes have a dominance / recessivity ratio between them, that is, some genes will override others. The B gene is dominant on the b gene, and the G gene is dominant on the b gene. The b gene is always recessive.  For example, an individual with brown eyes may have the combination:  Chromosome 15 (EYCL3 gene): Allele 1 => B, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => B Chromosome 19 (EYCL1 gene): Allele 1 => b, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => b The color determined by the EYCL1 gene is blue, but that determined by the EYCL3 gene is brown.
					
					Finally, this individual would have brown eyes because the gene EYCL3 (having value B) will be dominant on the EYCL1 gene (having value b).  The notion of "undefined" color corresponds to an individual whose eye color is unknown. This means that he can possess one of the sixteen possible combinations that can determine the color of his eyes.  Of the sixteen possible combinations: twelve correspond to the brown color, three to the green color, and one to the blue color.  Here are the sixteen possible combinations:  BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => BROWN Bb Gb => BROWN Bb bG => BROWN Bb bb => BROWN BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => GREEN Bb Gb => GREEN Bb bG => GREEN Bb bb => BLUE   When we know the color of an individual's eyes, we can determine the possible combinations corresponding to him.
The chromosomes of baby will be made up of one or the other of the alleles of each of the parents.  We can therefore calculate all the possible combinations determined by the eye color of each parent.  For example:  - For two parents with brown eyes, the number of possible combinations is 331776 !!! - For two parents with blue eyes, the number of possible combinations is now only 16 (but all equal to "bb bb").  Using this method of calculation, we find that two parents with blue eyes and / or green eyes can not have a child with brown eyes. Whereas in reality this could happen! Even if the possibilities are minimal, they prove the limits of this method of calculation.  It is for this reason that the calculator is "rigged" when the final result is displayed, in the event that both parents have green and or blue eyes, to indicate a minimum percentage of chance that the child could have brown eyes.           Frequently asked questions             What are the different elements that make up the eye?   The eye is an organ that detects light and is the basis of the sense of sight. Its function is to convert light energy into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the optic nerve. The human eye works in a very similar manner to that of most vertebrates and some molluscs.  It is made up of :    Of a lens, which is adjustable according to the distance;  Of a "diaphragm", called pupil, whose diameter is regulated by the iris;  And a light-sensitive tissue, which is the retina..    The light penetrates through the pupil, passes through the lens and is projected on the retina, where it is transformed, thanks to cells called photoreceptors, into nerve impulses that will be transported via the optic nerve to reach the brain.     Does the color of the eyes change with age?   The color or tint of the eyes of a human being changes very little during our existence, except during the first days of our lives when the color of our baby's eyes is not yet completely determined.  But some diseases, or serious accidents can slightly transform the color of our eyes.  Another cause of an individual's eye color change is the fact that some have an iris or melanin is not uniformly distributed, resulting in an iris of many colors. According to various external changes (such as sunlight), or physiological (blood pressure), the color perceived by people watching you may differ.     Can we change the color of his eyes?   The color of the eyes depends on the type and amount of pigment the iris has. This pigment, called melanin, is a natural eye protection against ultraviolet rays.  During the evolution of the human species, over the centuries, a greater amount of melanin has developed in the sunnier areas (brown eyes, black eyes, brown eyes) and less melanin (gray eyes, blue eyes, green eyes) in the less luminous areas.  Many people, for aesthetic reasons, want to change the color of their eyes and the only way is the use of cosmetic contact lenses which, if they are well adapted, is a safe method.     What is the percentage of people with brown, green or blue eyes?   The distribution of the color of the eyes of human beings on our planet is far from homogeneous. This distribution varies enormously according to the geographical areas and ethnic groups represented.  The eye colors vary from blue, green brown, amber, brown, almost black, gray or even multicolored! But we can classify them into three main categories: blue, green and brown.  The most represented color in the world is the brown color, with about 75% of the world's population, then comes the color of blue eyes with about 23% and finally the color green with less than 2%.     What are the laws of Mendelian genetics?   Mendel's laws were developed by a genetic researcher, considered the father of genetics: Gregor Mendel. This scientist has conducted experiments that have elucidated the fundamental elements of heredity, an example of Mendel's law is the prediction of the traits of descendants by the characteristics of the parents of an animal or plant species.  This scientist has been inventing some of the most well known terms of genetics, such as the terms "dominant" and "recessive", which are hereditary factors present in the characteristics and hereditary traits of organisms across the three laws from Mendel. Which are: "Law of uniformity of the first generation hybrids", "Law of disjunction of the alleles" and "Law of independent segregation of the multiple hereditary characters".     Where does the color of green eyes come from?   Green eyes are the product of moderate amounts of melanin. Green is an intermediate color between brown tones and blue or gray tones.  The genes involved are EYCL1 and EYCL3. Thus, the dominant allele for EYCL1, conjugated to any allele for EYCL3, with the exception of the dominant allele of the latter, leads to the green color of the eyes. It is native to Europe and only 2% of the world's population has this eye color.     What is the origin of the color of blue eyes?   Soon after birth, many babies have blue eyes, even if their parents have brown eyes, because the melanin proteins responsible for the pigmentation of the iris have not all been released yet.  It is the variation of the levels of this pigment, associated with the effect of light interference, which gives birth to all the colors of the eyes that we know. Depending on the amount of melanin present, the eye may appear dark brown, light, nutty, green, gray or blue.  In 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen discovered a particular genetic mutation regulating a protein needed for melanin production.  According to Hans Eiberg, who led the research, this genetic discovery suggests that all the blue-eyed people around us today are the descendants of a single human being, who would probably have lived between the ages of 6,000 and 10,000.  Eidberg argues that all people had brown eyes until this genetic mutation in the OCA2 gene triggers a process that literally "extinguishes" the ability to produce the brown color in the iris.  However, before this gene was discovered, Francis Galton was already curious about the origin of blue eye color, as Hugh Aldersey-Williams explains in his book Anatomies:  « A briefcase with sixteen numbered glass eyes of different colors was constructed. The eyes have been arranged in a sheet of molded metal so as to provide each eye with eyelids and an eyebrow, a surreal dread occurs when the briefcase is opened for the first time. Galton had to make sure that the color labels he had chosen from the "wide variety of terms" used by compilers of family registers were the most important in nature. He did not choose brown or blue, as we usually do, but categories of light and dark, dividing those with "hazel" eyes into both fields. Then he compared the children with their parents and grandparents, using abundantly their usual statistical storm, but found nothing more remarkable to say at the end of his observation is that the blue and brown eyes persist for generations. »  It seems that people with blue or green eyes are more likely to suffer from skin cancer, especially melanoma. In reality, being a person with white skin and blue eyes is an anomaly that has been produced by very specific conditions.  About 20% of the population has blue eyes. They are relatively common in Europe, with more marked areas in the Nordic and Eastern countries where the majority of the population has blue eyes.     Can we have one eye of one color and the other of another?   Yes, but it's pretty rare. Studies show that fewer than 11 out of a thousand people have different colored eyes.  This strange feature is due to several factors, and can change over time. The color of the iris develops during the first months after birth, melanin levels in the iris determine the color of the eyes. But sometimes the concentration and distribution of melanin are not uniform in both eyes, leading to a known phenomenon called heterochromia.  This anomaly can occur in different ways:   Complete heterochromia, when each eye is of a clearly different color, for example, a blue and other brown eye.  Central heterochromia, when the eyes have many colors, like a blue iris with a yellow-brown ring around the pupil.  And sectoral heterochromia, when the iris has a touch of color different from its general tone.  Alterations in eye pigmentation are not necessarily indicative of an underlying medical problem, but are the common features of many hereditary genetic disorders. But sometimes the formation of tumors inside the eye can cause heterochromia.     Why do babies have blue eyes at birth?   The color of the eye is due to the amount of melanin that the iris contains. It is a protein secreted by melanocytes that stain the iris, hair and skin.  In the newborn, the melanin-producing cells, the melanocytes, are still immature and produce melanin in small amounts. Over the months, this melanin production increases and darkens the skin, hair and eyes. There is a popular belief, which links the light color of the baby's eyes to the duration of breastfeeding. In other words, some people think that the light color of the baby's eyes is caused by breastfeeding. In fact, there is no scientific basis for this belief. The average duration of breastfeeding being 6 to 9 months, this could coincide with the darkening of the eyes of a baby depending on the maturation of melanocytes. But there appears to be a relationship between sun exposure and activation of melanin production by melanocytes. In some adults, the color of their eyes has changed as a function of their exposure to the sun. But the final color of a baby's eyes is defined genetically even though some external factors such as light are likely to influence it. After birth, if the melanocytes secrete a small amount of melanin, the baby will have blue eyes. If this amount is a bit higher, the baby's eyes will be green, honey or hazel. And if the secretion of melanin is greater, the baby's eyes will be brown, dark brown or black.     Can a blue-eyed mother and father have a brown-eyed baby?      Can two parents with brown eyes have a baby with blue eyes?      What are all the colors of the existing eyes?      What is the rarest eye color?

For starters, people describe this magnificent eye color in many different ways. Some say it looks like hazelnut, while others call it golden or brownish green. One of the reasons it's so hard to describe hazel-colored eyes is that the hue itself seems to change, depending on what you wear and the type of lighting you are in.  To complicate matters further, although hazel eyes appear to contain hues of green, amber and even blue, these color pigments don't exist in the human eye. So where does this stunning color come from?  What Determines Eye Color?  Most of us were taught in high school science class that we inherit our eye color from our parents, and that brown eye color is dominant and blue is recessive (so two parents with blue eyes cannot have a child with brown eyes because neither parent carries the dominant form of the gene for brown eyes).                   Hazel eyes often have a mixture of green, brown and amber hues. Their color can be hard to describe, since ambient lighting and clothing colors can affect your perception of them. [Enlarge]     But it turns out the story is more complicated than that.  More recent research has shown that up to 16 genes (not just one or two) may influence eye color, which makes predicting eye color much more difficult.  Due to variations in the interaction and expression of multiple genes, it's hard to say for sure what color a child's eyes will be based on the color of his or her parents' eyes. For example, we now know it's possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a child with brown eyes  something the old model of eye color inheritance would have deemed impossible.

Also, eye color can change dramatically in the first few years of life; many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes and then develop brown, green or hazel eyes in childhood. This phenomenon has little to do with genetics, but it does help explain where hazel eyes come from.  What Causes Hazel Eyes?  The pigmented structure inside the eye that surrounds the pupil and gives eyes their color is called the iris . The pigment responsible for eye color is called melanin, which also affects skin color.  The reason many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes is that they don't have the full amount of melanin present in their irises at birth. In the first few years of life, more melanin often develops in the iris, causing blue eyes to turn green, hazel or brown.  Babies whose eyes turn from blue to brown develop significant amounts of melanin. Those who end up with green eyes or hazel eyes develop a little less.  Babies of African-American, Hispanic and Asian ethnicities usually are born with dark eyes that stay brown throughout life. This is because these individuals naturally have more melanin in their eyes and skin, compared with non-Hispanic whites.     Light Absorption And Scattering  Remember, there are no blue, green or hazel pigments in the eye. Eyes merely have different amounts of melanin, which is dark brown.  So how can a dark brown pigment create blue, green or hazel eyes? This is possible because of two processes:   Melanin in the iris absorbs different wavelengths of light entering the eye.  Light is scattered and reflected by the iris, and some wavelengths (colors) scatter more easily than others.   Eyes with high concentrations of melanin absorb more light entering the eye, so less is scattered and reflected back from the iris. The result is a brown eye color.  In eyes with lower concentrations of melanin, less light is absorbed, and more is scattered and reflected by the iris. Since light rays with shorter wavelengths (blue and green light) scatter more easily than light rays with longer wavelengths (red light), eyes with less light-absorbing melanin appear green or hazel, and eyes with low concentrations of melanin appear blue.  Also, the distribution of melanin can vary in different parts of the iris, causing hazel eyes to appear light brown near the pupil and more green in the periphery of the iris.  Hazel Eyes Are A Work Of Art  Hazel eye color is both complex and magnificent, since its specific features are determined by so many factors  including the amount and distribution of melanin in the iris, how scattering of light by the iris and pigment molecules affects color, and how perception of eye color is influenced by lighting and the color of our clothing and surroundings.  Just as it takes many strokes of the artist's brush to produce a masterpiece, hazel eyes involve the dynamics of several elements to create the unique work of art that's represented in every hazel eye.  If you wear eyeglasses, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating to eliminate distracting reflections in your glasses and allow others to see the beauty of your hazel eye color.  Change Your Eye Color To Hazel  If your eyes aren't naturally hazel, but you've always wanted them to be, you can achieve your wish with color contact lenses. They won't actually change your eye color, of course, just the appearance of it.  Want to try hazel eye color? Ask your eye care professional for a prescription for color contact lenses. [Enlarge]   Contact lenses are available in many colors, so you'll have a choice of several shades of hazel. But it's not simply a matter of choosing a lens color you like; the natural color of your eyes has a role in determining which lenses you should wear.  If you have very light eyes, you might be able to use a lens with an "enhancement tint." This lens has a translucent color that lets some of your natural color show through. It's meant to enhance your natural eye color  to make your light blue eyes a deeper blue, for example  but if your eyes are light enough, you might achieve the hazel you want with an enhancement tint.  More likely, you'll need an "opaque tint." These lenses are designed to mask your natural color with a solid version of the color you desire. They're often used when the color you want to achieve is lighter than your natural color.  An eye care professional can show you various colors and help you make the right choice. Remember, contact lenses are a prescription item, and if you don't already wear contacts, you'll need an eye exam and a prescription before getting them  even if your lenses don't need any corrective power in them.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

McDonald University of Delaware    Introduction  Arm folding  Asparagus urine  Attached earlobe  Beeturia  Bent pinkie  Cheek dimples  Cleft chin  Darwin's tubercle  Earwax  Eye color  Hair color  Hair whorl  Hand clasping  Hitchhiker's thumb  Mid-digital hair  PTC tasting  Toe length  Tongue rolling  Widow's peak    Eye color: The myth  One of the oldest myths in human genetics is that having blue eyes is determined by a single gene, with the allele for blue eyes recessive to the allele for non-blue eyes (green, brown, or hazel). Many people who know nothing else about genetics think that two blue-eyed parents cannot have a brown-eyed child.   The reality  Eye color as a character  The color of the iris is determined by the amount of melanin, the ratio of eumelanin (which is dark brown) to pheomelanin (which is reddish), and the way the melanin is distributed in the eye. Irises with little melanin appear blue due to scattering of light by collagen fibers in the iris. Blue, gray, green and hazel eyes are only common in people of European ancestry; other people's eyes are various shades of brown.  Many studies divide eye colors into three categories: blue (or blue and gray); green and hazel; and brown. This has been criticized as an oversimplification (Brues 1975), and eye colors have been divided into nine categories (Mackey et al. 2011) or the hue and saturation values quantified (Liu et al. 2010). Eye color can change dramatically in the first few years of life, as many babies are born with blue eyes but then develop green or brown eyes (Matheny and Dolan 1975), and changes can also occur later in life (Bito et al. 1997, Liu et al. 2010). Some people have a blue or green iris with a brown ring around the pupil (Sturm and Larsson 2009), which makes the classification of eye color even more complicated.  Family studies  Davenport and Davenport (1907) were the first to suggest that blue eye color was caused by a recessive allele. They claimed that whenever both parents had blue eyes, all of the children have blue eyes, but their data actually included two hazel-eyed offspring of blue-eyed parents. The authors said "we suspect [these] to be of a blue type," whatever that means.  Hurst (1908) divided eyes into just two types, "simplex" (blues and some grays, with no pigment on the outer surface of the iris) and "duplex" (all other colors). He found the following results:    Parents  Duplex offspring  Simplex offspring    Duplex x Duplex  240  18    Duplex x Simplex  187  137    Simplex x Simplex  0  101    Because there are no "duplex" (non-blue-eyed) offspring of two blue-eyed parents, these data fit the model of blue eyes being caused by a recessive allele at one gene.  Holmes and Loomis (1909) criticized the earlier work, saying that eye color varies continuously, and dividing it into categories is arbitrary. Out of 52 offspring of two blue-eyed parents in their data, one had brown eyes and two had gray eyes, which does not fit the idea that blue eyes are caused by a recessive allele. Boas (1918) found an even larger number of non-blue-eyed offspring of two blue-eyed parents, 26 out of 223. Surprisingly, there don't seem to have been any parent-offspring studies of eye color since then, at least none that I could find.  Molecular genetics  A number of groups surveyed associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with eye color, with fairly consistent results: variation in the HERC2 and OCA2 genes, which are next to each other on chromosome 15, plays a major role in determining eye color. However, variation in at least 10 other genes, plus complicated interactions between these genes, also influences eye color (reviewed in Sturm and Larsson 2009, with more recent results in Liu et al. 2010 and Pospiech et al. 2011).   Conclusion  Eye color is not an example of a simple genetic trait, and blue eyes are not determined by a recessive allele at one gene. Instead, eye color is determined by variation at several different genes and the interactions between them, and this makes it possible for two blue-eyed parents to have brown-eyed children.

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Eye Colors Around the World: How Rare is Your Eye Color?   June 9, 2017 What's In Style      79   0        0               Eyes are such a unique characteristic that people have. Eyes range in different colors, some that are very common and some that are quite rare. Here are some of the most common and rarest eye colors found around the world.  Brown Eyes  With brown-eye people making up more than 55% of the global population, brown eyes are the most common eye color amongst people. In fact, nearly all members of the African and Asian population share brown eyes. This is because of it being a dominant genetic trait due to melanin existing in the eye.  Blue Eyes  While brown eyes are genetically dominant, blue eye color is recessive genetic trait, which makes them much less common amongst people. Blue eye color exists because there is an absence of pigments, and blue eyes appear from the scattered light reflected off of the iris. Although less common than brown eyes, about 8% of people in the world have blue eyes. They can often be found in people in northern Europe.  Hazel Eyes  While hazel eyes have similarities to brown eyes, they are usually a lighter color with more of a green and yellow tint. Hazel eyes are created because there is higher concentrated melanin around the border of the pupil than the rest of the iris. This results in the appearance of a multi-colored iris that ranges from copper to green in certain lights. Approximately 5-8% of people in the world have hazel eyes.  Green Eyes  Green eyes can often be mistaken for hazel eyes, but they are two completely different eye colors. In addition, green eyes are one of the rarest eye colors found worldwide with only 2% of people having green eyes. Green eyes occur because of a mild amount of melanin, a burst a lipochrome, and a golden tint. The golden tint mixes with a natural base of blue to create the green color. Green eye people most frequently live in northern and central Europe, but western Asia can also be a place where it is found.  Silver Eyes  Often, silver colored eyes are considered to be a variation of blue eyes. However, they are a rare eye color that still look distinct from blue eyes. Like blue colored eyes, silver is created due to low pigmentation in the eyes. Though quite rare, silver eyes can be found most frequently in eastern Europe.  Black Eyes  Although there are some people with eyes as dark as night, this is not true black. It is actually just extremely dark brown. This happens because of a significantly higher concentration of melanin throughout the iris. Often with this eye color, it is even difficult to distinguish between the pupil and the iris.  Red or Pink Eyes  Red or pink colored eyes can be a result of albinism or blood leaking into the iris. Albino people often have extremely light blue eye from lack of pigmentation, but certain forms of albinism causes a red or pink eye color instead.  Amber Eyes  Amber colored eyes are a very rare find around the world, but they are most common in Asia and South America. This eye color can vary from a golden yellow to more of a copper color. While amber eyes are frequently confused with hazel eyes, the difference is that hazel has brown and green while amber is a single color. The high amount of lipochrome gives the appearance of glowing eyes. This eye color is found more in animals than in humans.  Violet Eyes  This is another rare eye color typically found in people with albinism. In fact, it is believed that truly violet eyes cannot exist with having albinism. Violet eyes occurs from mixing lack of pigment and red from light reflecting off of blood vessels within the eyes.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this simple model .  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.  The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).  New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.  The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:   The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.  Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.  So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.  And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.  Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!  So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.                             Carrying a Dominant Trait               Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.  People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.  These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.  HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:    These different combinations give the following eye colors:    Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.  But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:    The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:    Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:    The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:    Here are the rest of the possibilities:    Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.  Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!  And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:    All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  (Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)  Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.                She could be carrying a brown eye gene!               Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other               Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click here to learn why no pigment gives blue.)  OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.  Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.  If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.  Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!  Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.  This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.  Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:    When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.  This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.  So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.  The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.   OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked  An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.  Imagine these parents:    If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:   The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.  Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:   Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.  Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called recombination .  That is a story for another day…     By Dr. Barry Starr, Stanford University                                                                                                               The Tech Museum of Innovation 201 South Market Street San Jose, CA 95113 +1 (408) 294-8324  The Tech Museum of Innovation 2013 © All rights reserved.

Dominant vs. Recessive          Back to Dominant vs. Recessive           English   Español       Which parent gives you the most dominant genes?        -An undergraduate from Indiana   October 12, 2011  Except for a few special cases (see below), it doesn't really matter which parent gave you which gene. If a gene version is dominant, it will dominate whether it came from mom or dad.  So your chances of getting a dominant trait don't depend on which parent it came from. If mom gives you the dominant brown eye version of an eye color gene, odds are you'll end up with brown eyes. Same thing if dad passes the same gene. In neither case would you have higher odds for getting brown eyes.  Now that isn't to say that if mom has brown eyes then all her kids will too. They could end up with the other parent's recessive blue or green eyes. Or an eye color that neither parent has!  This is how brown-eyed parents end up with a blue-eyed child. Or how two parents who don't have red hair have a redheaded baby.  As you can see, genetics is a complicated business. But one thing we do know...no one is more likely to favor one parent over the other. Which traits you get depend on the combination of genes you get from both parents.  What I'll do for the rest of the answer is explain a bit about how genes work. Then I'll focus on some situations where the parents do matter. As you'll see, this is usually when a trait is on the X chromosome.   Dominant and Recessive  Let's say that a child has a mom with brown eyes and dad with blue eyes. Since brown eyes are dominant, the mom can have either one brown (B) and one blue (b) version of an eye color gene or she can have two browns. As geneticists like to say, she can be either Bb or BB.  To make things easier, we will say that she is BB (both genes are the brown version). Since the dad has blue eyes, he has two copies of the recessive blue version. He is bb.  Each parent will pass one copy of their eye color gene to their child. In this case, the mom will always pass B and the dad will always pass b. This means all of their kids will be Bb and have brown eyes. Each child will show the mom's dominant trait.  Now if we flip things around where the father has two brown versions (BB) and the mom has two blue ones (bb), the child will still end up Bb and having brown eyes. It doesn't matter if B came from mom or dad. It only mattered that the child got a B.  I don't want you to think that if one parent shows the dominant trait, all their children will too. They may not. Let me give another eye color example to show you what I mean.  Imagine a mom with one version of the brown and one version of the blue eye color gene. She is Bb and has brown eyes. Dad is bb and has blue eyes.  These are the same eye colors that the parents had in the first example. But the result could turn out very differently.  The kids each have a 50% chance of having mom's brown eyes and a 50% chance of having dad's blue eyes. (This is because mom has a 50% chance of passing her B and a 50% chance of passing her b.) So in this case, the kids can end up with mom's dominant trait or dad's recessive one. Which one is a simple matter of chance.*  And if we take a Bb dad (brown eyes) and a bb mother (blue eyes), there is still a 50% chance for the child to have blue eyes. Again it didn't matter which parent gave which gene version. What was important is that these two gene versions were involved.  This is true for many, many traits besides eye color. But not all of them. Sometimes it matters whether your mom or dad has a dominant trait.   Blame (or Thank) Mom Through our discussion so far, you may have picked up on the fact that we have two copies of our genes - one from mom and one from dad. But this isn't true for every gene.   Red-green colorblindness (II) is one of the few traits where it matters which parent the gene came from.  Whether you are a boy or a girl mostly depends on whether you have an X and a Y chromosome or two X's. If you have an X and a Y, then you are a boy. If you have two X's, then you are a girl.  This matters for our discussion because it means that girls (and so moms) have two copies of all the genes on the X chromosome while boys (and dads) have just one. The genes on mom's X chromosome will dominate for her sons whether they are dominant or recessive. Let's look at color blindness as an example to figure out why.  Imagine that mom is colorblind. Since being colorblind is recessive, she has two copies of the color blind version of the gene (c). Geneticists say she is Xc Xc because the recessive version is on the X chromosome.  In our case, dad isn't color blind. Since he has just one X chromosome, he has a single copy of the version of the gene that lets him tell red from green. He is XC Y. (The XC means he has the dominant version of the color vision gene on his X. The Y has no color vision gene on it and so is here as a marker.)  OK, now what happens when these two parents have sons? They are all colorblind like their mother. Her recessive trait dominates!  Let me take you through how this happened. Since the child is a boy, we know dad passed his Y (otherwise the child would be a girl). This doesn't contribute any color vision genes.  Mom will pass one of her Xc's to her son. The son now has an Xc and a Y. He has no dominant color vision gene version to overcome his color blind version and so is color blind like his mother. Every son will have that trait.  Colorblindness is one of a few special traits where it matters which parent a gene copy came from. For most traits it doesn't matter. What matters is the combination of genes you get no matter the source.  * As we talk about here , it is also possible for the child to have green, hazel or any other eye color.

Animated video shows the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

Will your new baby start with the classic blue eyes? And will they stay that way? Despite what you may have been taught, eye color inheritance is very complicated. We'll walk you through the odds that your child will inherit your eye colour, and your sight problems. We'll also cover some wild traits, like a pair of eyes with two different colors, albinism, and even purple eyes. Here's what you need to know!  15 Not as Simple as It Sounds                     Advertising [x]        Perhaps you once heard that eye color is determined by one gene, and that brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes so that if a child has the genetics for both colors they'll always end up with brown eyes. Well, scientists have found that eye color is much more complicated than we originally thought. There are at least four, and there may be fifteen or more, genes that contribute to eye color and so we can't predict with certainty what a child will inherit. Yet, this new complexity in eye color genetics allows for some interesting possibilities: two blue-eyed parents can have a brown-eyed child just like two brown-eyed parents can have a blue-eyed child. Let's start with some specifics.  14 The Eye "Ring"                     Advertising [x]        The iris is the colored part of the eye and is found all around the black pupil. The iris is the muscle that contracts to adjust the size of the pupil, changing how much light gets into the eye. Yet, there is another part of the eye that's important for color: the Limbal ring. It's a dark ring around the iris. Your child's will likely be very distinct, but they do tend to get smaller and lighter with age - while on some people they are imperceptible. As they get smaller and lighter, the color of your eyes appear to lighten with them.  13 Some Children Are Born with Blue Eyes                     Advertising [x]        Children with light skin will likely be born with blue eyes. This is because the same substance that produces skin colour, melanin, also produces eye colour. Children with less melanin will have blue eyes that can change colour until about three years old. These parents will have to play a waiting game to know for sure what colour their child's eyes will be, but, of course, they may remain blue.  12 Heterochromia: Two Different Colored Eyes                     Some babies are born with, or develop, two different eye colors. If you notice this, be sure to mention it to your doctor as it may be a sign of Horner's Syndrome, which can be serious. There are other causes of heterochromia including: trauma in the womb, inflammation, chimerism, another (harmless) genetic disorder, or a freckle on one iris. The freckle is usually harmless, especially in young people, and may make for all kinds of odd or beautiful eyes.  11 Blue Eyes                     If you love blue eyes you'll be disappointed to know that predicting them is now very complicated, with the ten or so genes involved. But, we know how the two major genes in eye colour genetics work, and if you and your partner both have blue eyes you're likely to pass it on. If one of you has brown eyes your chances are much slimmer, probably around twenty-five per cent. They do improve somewhat, to about fifty per cent, if the brown-eyes parent carries a recessive gene for blue eyes. You're more likely to carry this recessive blue eyed gene if your siblings and/or your parents have blue eyes, but its no guarantee. Also, it's still possible to have a brown eyed child, even if both you and your partner have light eyes.  10 Grey Eyes                     Advertising [x]        Grey eyes aren't an urban myth, but they are a mystery. There are a few theories as to what makes eyes grey. Some think that grey eyes have even less melanin than blue eyes, while others think that the shape of the eye is different, so the light is refracted at a different angle, which changes the colour. But, because no one knows what causes this eye colour no one can predict if your child will have grey eyes or not.  9 Green Eyes                     So far we've talked about melanin as though it's only one thing, but there are actually two types of melanin in humans: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is dark and responsible for dark skin and dark eye colour. Pheomelanin is yellow, and is responsible for green eye colour. Why green? When yellow light refracts through the shape of the human eye it turns green. Its the same reason that the sky is blue, as the light changes angles when it moves through the atmosphere and becomes blue. Green eyes aren't very likely, but they are common to both Irish and German ancestries.

Brown eyes are the result of high levels of eumelanin. regardless of the level of pheomelanin, as eumelanin usually cancels it out as far as colour is concerned. If you have brown eyes you're likely to pass them on, although its not impossible for your child to have other eye colors. If you feel like brown eyes are a little overlooked, don't worry, people actually find them more youthful than other eye colors and so they receive their fair share of adoration.  7 Hazel Eyes                     Advertising [x]        These eyes are a simple mixture between blue and green eyes, or between eumelanin and pheomelanin. The mixture explains why the eye sometimes appears more green, and sometimes appears more brown, as lighting conditions or surrounding colors emphasize one melanin or the other.  6 Amber Eyes                     Keeping in mind that human eye colour occurs on a spectrum, amber eyes are a variant of brown eyes. These eyes appear in stunning shades of warm browns to almost honey yellow. However, little is certain about how this eye colour is formed, never mind how it is passed on.  5 Purple Eyes                     Although there's a popular myth that purple, or violet eyes exist, they don't. The myth also argues that people with purple eyes also have super human gifts, so its no surprise that the myth originated in fan fiction.  4 Red Eyes: Albinism                     Advertising [x]        This is a very rare condition that results in very light, even seemingly pure white, hair and skin colour. Sometimes the eyes of people with albinism can appear red, because in some lighting the blood vessels at the back of eye can be seen due to the total lack of melanin. Otherwise the eyes appear blue, or even darker colors depending on the type of albinism. Though children with albinism are usually born to parents without it, and though albinism can occur in any ethnicity, only one in 17,000 Americans have albinism. Your child is very unlikely to be born with albinism.  3 Will Your Child Need Glasses?                     There are other eye genetics that you could pass onto your child, including the need for glasses. Both nearsightedness and farsightedness are very likely to be determined by genetics, but the inheritance isn't cut and dry. Research from 2013 suggests that there is a strong environmental component to nearsightedness, including a lack of natural light during a child's eye development, making its occurrence hard to predict. It's best to get your child's eyes checked as they begin school, and frequently as they grow.  2 Color Blindness                     Those who are color blind were usually born with it and are more often boys than girls. The genes for red/green and blue colour blindness are carried on the X chromosome, so when a girl inherits this gene they usually have a healthy second X chromosome that prevents the color blindness. Men, however, have a Y chromosome instead and will be color blind if they have one copy of color blindness genes. Your son will have a chance of being color blind if their maternal grandfather was. For sons, the father's genes don't matter as the father only passes on a Y chromosome. On the other hand, your daughter may become a carrier if her father is color blind, because he does pass down an X chromosome to her.  1 Other Hereditary Blindness                     Blindness is very unlikely. For example, only five out of a thousand children will be born with cataracts, which cause blindness without treatment . Despite the low odds, it is important to bring any concerns you have about your child's sight to your doctor. Surgery for congenital eye cataracts should and can be done before the child is four months old, which will prevent the child from becoming blind. The sooner any potential sight issue is caught, the less of an affect it may have on your child's development.

(Click to expand) Image by Mike DeHaan  Although the main question expectant parents ask is, ‘Will my baby be healthy?’ it’s also fun to ask other questions – such as, ‘What eye color will my baby have?’  Baby Eye Color Predictor  How can we predict a baby’s eye color?  We expect that a Caucasian baby will have gray or blue eyes at birth, since the color pigments have not yet developed fully, and usually African and Asian babies have brown eyes from birth.  By nine months, most Caucasian babies settle into their adult color: blue, brown, green or hazel. Some children will change eye color all the way up to age three, so don’t get too comfortable with your baby’s eye color until he or she is in preschool, it could still change!  Regardless of the eye color your baby ends up with later on, but before he or she is born, there’s no way to know for sure. Can you The question, however, is to predict your child’s eye color before birth, based on the parent’s genetic legacy? Let’s start with the classic “blue versus brown” match-up, and deal with the simplest situation.  ________________  Would you like to see more articles like this?

Each gene consists of a pair of alleles . Each parent donates one allele, so the child inherits a pair of alleles. The chart in the image above is a essentially a Punnett square.  A person with two dominant brown alleles, ‘ BB ‘, will have brown eyes. Another, with two recessive blue alleles, ‘ bb ‘, will have blue eyes. The brown dominance means that a mixed gene, ‘ Bb ‘, will be expressed as brown-eyed. Two blue-eyed people will have a blue-eyed child. Since the parents must each have a ‘bb’ gene, they can only pass ‘b’ alleles to the next generation. However, brown-eyed parents have either a ‘Bb’ or a ‘BB’ gene. You only know that a brown-eyed person has a mixed ‘Bb’ allele if that person had one blue-eyed parent.  From the chart, we can see that a child with brown-eyed parents has one chance in eight, or 12.5%, of being blue-eyed; and then only if one parent has some possible blue-eyed ancestry. Again, a mix of blue-eyed and brown-eyed parents has a “2/8=1/4=25%” chance of a blue-eyed child.  However, there is no guarantee that the situation will be quite this simple. Hazel and green eye color can both result from a weaker “brown” contribution.  Blue Eyed, Brown Eyed, Hazel or Green?  When you’re pregnant, it’s natural to wonder what your new baby’s eyes will be like, not to mention whether you’re having a boy or a girl , or how tall will she be . Although there’s no way to know for sure, you can use math to calculate the chances of brown eyes vs. blue, and more. © Copyright 2013 Mike DeHaan: Math, All rights Reserved.

I am pretty sure our baby will just have brown eyes. Brown is pretty dominant and with your husband having only brown eyed parents, I don't think its likely recessive genes like colored eyes will show up over that.

Reply  Close j  jamiea1985 Brown is dominant, so unless you happen to have a recessive gene for blue eyes your baby will most likely have brown eyes. My 16 month old has big brown eyes that everyone falls in love with. Reply  Close J  Jeepin-Momma I seen this on fb. Idk how actuate it is but it is cool. I have super bright green eyes and my hubby has beautiful brown eyes so I'm interested to see what our kids have.

If you have a recessive blue gene hidden somewhere it could be blue. Otherwise I'm afraid it'll be brown. Reply  Close c  cassie77775 Brown Is dominant so Big chance they will be Brown. I have brown and hubby Has a bluish green. Oldest son has Bluish green, middle has blue and littlest has blue. No brown eyes whatsoever so my best guess is my moms blue eyes got passed down instead of my dads brown. Who knows I suck at genetics :) Reply  Close S  SelinaWarren94 My whole family has brown eyes except for my brother on my dads side. My husband's family ranges from brown to a few blue and our son has beautiful blue eyes!! Reply  Close K  Kb2129 @Jeepin-Momma  Only thing that makes me wonder, is I have dark brown eyes and my husband has light blue eyes. Our daughter was born with blue eyes that have changed to green.

Reply  Close P  Pumi7 @Kb2129  Green is a mutation. My mother has green eyes and her parents had blue and brown, so the 0% on that chart is totally incorrect. Reply  Close s  sadabug I have brown eyes and I'm mostly Croatian. We just had our 3rd child this past December and he was my first brown eyed baby. My son has beautiful blue eyes. My daughter has a rare eye condition where she doesn't really have any irises. However, there is a slight rim and it appears to be blue as well. My husband has beautiful green eyes. I'm hoping this boy will have his daddy's eyes. Then I'll have one of each color and a black eyed child (due to the Aniridia). Reply  Close g  genevieve127 I think they have discovered now that eye color has a lot more genetics than originally thought. It has something to do with the amount of melanin that you are born with. My husband I both have brown eyes and really dark hair. Our son came out blonde haired and blue eyed and he is 100% ours we didn't let him out of our sight at the hospital lol. It's a total gamble. I'm curios what this one is going to look like will we have 2 children that look nothing like us? Haha Reply  Close n  nshelton16 My husband & I both have very very dark brown eyes, he is Mexican also so his whole family has brown eyes. I'm half black, half white & all of my siblings have brown eyes. However my mom has hazel eyes & her father, my grandfather has blue eyes. Well our daughter came out with blue eyes (to everyone's surprise!) & around 15 months they switched to green. They're amazing. But a lot of people ask how it happened & we're still not sure other than maybe some recessive genes from my mothers side. So anything is possible! Reply  Close t  th3hbomb My eyes are brown, my husband's eyes are blue and our sons eyes are brown in the middle, then green, then metallic blue on the outside. They are the most fabulous eyes I've ever seen, haha! And so unexpected. Reply  Close E  Ejoynerk Thank you guys so much for responding! My husbands family is all blue eyes and I'm pretty sure my family has brown eyes unfortunately I'm not 100% sure about my family since I was removed when I was a toddler. So I guess it can go both ways. Reply  Close E  Ejoynerk @nshelton16  Wow that is amazing! Reply  Close K  Kb2129 @Pumi7  Yeah, that makes sense! I know my husband has no melanin in his eye (I think that's what he said). When he has eye appointments the eye docs are always fascinated to see his eyes because usually people have a little. His is completely empty. He has the light blue eyes. And here I have dark, brown eyes, which I think means I have a lot of melanin in my eyes? Makes sense for our daughter's eyes to be somewhere between since we are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. I am curious to see what babe #2 has! Reply  Close m  mollmill0 @Pumi7  Agreed! My mom has blue, my dad has brown. I have green! My dad's mother had green also. Reply  Close m  mardahockeystar As everyone is saying there little chance for blue eyes unless your parents or even any of your grandparents have blue eyes. There's always hope there's a mutation and blue becomes dominant!

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  10 Posts a  alifix @DoubleUnicornPoo  I'm wondering this too. Our girls are 16 weeks and I swear they're a different shade every day & also look different depending on the light. Some days they still look blue, and yet from other angles they look green/brown. I think babies have up until 6 months till their final color should be dominant. k  kseds @DoubleUnicornPoo  My babies were all born with blue eyes - they never changed colour. My eyes are blue, and my husband's range from grey to green depending on what colour he is wearing! D  DoubleUnicornPoo @kseds  Yeah. DH's are this crazy pale blue but they'll be more blue some days and more gray others depending on what he's wearing and the light. Apparently growing up, him and his siblings always bothered their mom with who had the best eyes (all 3 had blue) and one day his mom gave in and said he did. Well, when his niece was born, she took the "best eyes in the family" crown. So obviously he's hoping to get that back to our girls instead of his sister's daughter. Oh the sibling rivalry never ends! :-) m  miracleprincebabies @DoubleUnicornPoo  My oldest was born with bright blue eyes. My eyes are brown and my husband has hazel. By the time she was six they turned gray and now she is 14 and they change from hazel, green, gray, and a hint of blue lol. K  Kraiford My son's eyes were blue at birth and changed to hazel after about three weeks and still are at 4, my daughter was born with brown eyes and they never changed. d  dsirish My daughter's eyes lightened from a dark blue into a pretty icy blue like my husband's around 5 mos. I know that brown is a dominant trait, and blue (eyes) is recessive, but I'm not sure about changes from blue to brown. My cousin's daughter's eyes were brown when born, the lightened into bright blue after a few mos. J  Jamiex6 I have one kid with blue, two with brown, and three with hazel.  It was clear from early on that my blue eyed baby would be blue and my brown eyed babies would be brown.  The hazel took longer to develop and kind of looked like a muddled grey as babies. m  merryjlewis I have brown eyes (with a 50% chance of a recessive blue gene) and my ex husband has green eyes (his parents and brother all have blue).  Our 10 yr old son was born with blue eyes.  Normally they say that if they're going to go brown they do so within the first year.  But when he was 1 they changed to green, when he was 2 they changed to grey, and it wasn't til he was between 3 and 4 that they finally deepened to brown.  Right now I'm 21w with identical twins with my new husband (who has blue eyes), so I'm wondering if it will follow a similar pattern. D  DoubLL My DH has dark brown eyes. His mom has bright blue eyes. I have light brown eyes and my dad has bright blue eyes. With my twins my dd has my brown eyes and our ds has bright blue eyes! Their dr said that most likely he will keep his blue eyes. He said as long as both parents carry the recessive blue gene then it is a possibility. He is almost 15 weeks.

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  293 Posts K  KingsMommie Yes it's possible for your daughter  to have blue eyes.  She could have a recessive gene.  I'm blk (dark brown eyes) hubby is white (blue/green eyes) and our son was born with dark grey eyes that have gone to blue to blueish/grey to more of a grey now. He's 1.5 yrs old. I never thought I'd have a baby with eyes any color than brown L  Leyla28 @brexie  Same here except that my husband is Pakistani. Well, our two kids are proper Pakistani (no blue eyes :-()... I also wonder how this LO will be like. But it seems that the Pakistani genes are way stronger than mine :-) H  Hubbinator Blue eyes are recessive, that means it takes two recessive genes for them to occur. One recessive gene from you, one from your husband. If your daughter gets a recessive blue eyed gene from you and a dominate brown eyed gene from her dad, she will have brown eyes. k  kmezanava2135782723 @mcgeelisha  my daughter has blue eyes and brown hair. I'm white (blonde/green eyes) and husband is Mexican and Puerto Rican S  SarahChron @brexie  Both parents need to have blue eyes in the family. Both my parents had brown eyes. I ended up with blue because both grandmothers and one grandpa had blue eyes. Blue is represented with bb and Brown is represented with BB. So if both couple carry a b the it's likely for a baby to get bb. However if one parent does not carry a b and only BB the likely your baby can only be BB = brown or Bb =brown which in the case dominant gene rules. My husband is Asian I am Caucasian. Our children will never have blue eyes because he only has BB. However they may have lighter brown not so black. And of course they may be Bb so when they have children and marry someone with b then can have blue eyed grand babies hehehe H  Hubbinator @kmezanava2135782723  So somewhere along the line your husband inherited a recessive blue eyed gene. Really, not uncommon. My husband is from Brazil and our son ended up with blue eyes because there is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of Italian in him that gave him a recessive blue eyed gene. G  Gmom0218 @mcgeelisha  I am Vietnamese and DH is caucasian with red hair and hazel eyes. I must have some French in me b/c our son has the same coloring as daddy. He was born with blue eyes that turned hazel but his hair has stayed red. It can happen! 1  10bacon4 @mcgeelisha  My husband is Mexican and Portuguese with very dark brown eyes and I'm caucasian with blue eyes. At a year old our son's eyes are exactly the same blue as mine. We are definitely surprised since both my parents and his parents have brown eyes. n  nolechick429 @brexie  I'm Filipina and husband is Caucasian. Our 6 month old daughter has bright blue eyes. It skipped 5 generations on my side but it showed up eventually:) l  llotsoflove I'm white with hazel eyes and BF is black. He does not know of anyone on his side with blue but my Mothers family all have blue eyes. Our second son has beautiful blue grey eyes at 3 months old :) k  katedgd its nothing to do with indianess--do either of his parents or grandparents have light eyes? babes need 1 gene from eah side ti= e  etoledo3 I'm Cuban and my husband is puerto rican, we both have brown eyes. Our oldest son who's 9 has blue eyes. My grandparents had blue eyes on my dads side and my husband had to have blue eyes on his side of the family. Funny thing is that each of my siblings has one child with blue eyes. a  ana_karen so im full Mexican brown hair brown eyes. my hubby is half Mexican (dad) and half caucasian (mom) he has medium light brown eyes and hair. now one of my grampas gas hazel greenish eyes, my hubbys brother has hazel eyes as well. is there a chance my daughter can have colored eyes? 7  78renegade @brexie  Over the last couple of years scientists have discovered that there are MULTIPLE genes responsible for eye color so the old idea of using the punnet square (scientific equation involving mixing alleles, or more commonly known a dominant and recessive trait) apply to only each INDIVIDUAL gene. What this means is that it is possible for the blue eyes to come through. The information posted on here is somewhat true but a little outdated! Don't believe me --- google it! a  ayla_bean There is a possibility that your LO could have a combination of you and your mans eyes. My mother has really green eyes almost a blue and my biological father had dark brown, I can out with hazel eyes. Me and my bf are due in march and he is Indian and I am white, but because he has a bit of German in his family our baby could even come out with blue eyes. M  MonikaSk @brexie  This depends on the father, if your father passed on a "recessive light eye color" to you, your mother would have passed on one too. I would assume your dad is not 100% since he has recessive blue eyes jeans not a trait in that culture and it can from somewhere. It maybe way down line. (It's genealogy) now if your child's father has no recessive eye color jeans the dark will dominate the light. Such as it would be a constant dominate/recessive pairing & the dark will dominate. My parents have brown eyes, but both my grandmothers had blue. My sister has green eyes, I have brown, my husband has hazel & so does our daughter. So I am carrying a recessive jean. M  Mommysteinpfad It is possible if your baby's dad has a parent with blue eyes. If you out eye color into their alleles brown eyes=BB (both parents have brown eyes) or Bb(one parent has brown eyes and one parents has blue, which is what your child's alleles will be if she has brown eyes) and blue eyes=bb. So depending on your so alleles your daughters will be either Bb=she will have brown eyes or bb= your daughter will have blue eyes. If your so alleles are BB (both of his parents have brown eyes) your daughter will only get Bb alleles meaning she can only have brown eyes. C  Cevanne @brexie  Your dark eyes parent carried a recessive gene and a dominance one. Blue eyes must have 2 recessives. So your dad Bb. You bb. Your husband does not likely carry any recessive genes unless there has been an infusion somewhere in his families history. So he's probably BB. That means that your kids will probably be Bb. Sorry!!! So hazel or brown. My husbands family is Asian and both my kids ended up with his beautiful brown eyes. t  tambo_rambo83 Eye color is not simply determined by dominant recessive genetics! There are multiple alleles involved on 15 genes. It's much more complex than what people think ;) Related Articles & Discussions Baby Olympians Take Home Awards At Pittsburgh Hospital  Best Napper.

How it works           The determination of the eye color of an individual is a complex and fascinating phenomenon, especially when the birth of a new child approaches.  What color would my child's eyes be?  What are his chances of having brown, blue or green eyes?  The following answers are simplified explanations, the determination of the eye color of an individual depends on much more parameters than those cited below.  This method of calculation takes into account only three theoretical eye colors: brown, green and blue.
					
					The results given by this calculator are an estimate of the chance of having a child with the eyes of one of these three colors.  Two principal genes are detected as determinants for eye color: EYCL3 (localized on chromosome 15) and EYCL1 (localized on chromosome 19).
					
					The EYCL3 gene determines the amount of melanin present in our eye color, light eyes or dark eyes. Its value can be: B (Brown) or b (blue).					
					The EYCL1 gene determines the blue color or green color of our eyes.
					Its value may be: G (Green) or b (blue).  On each chromosome, we have two different alleles that come from our mother AND our father.  These genes have a dominance / recessivity ratio between them, that is, some genes will override others. The B gene is dominant on the b gene, and the G gene is dominant on the b gene. The b gene is always recessive.  For example, an individual with brown eyes may have the combination:  Chromosome 15 (EYCL3 gene): Allele 1 => B, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => B Chromosome 19 (EYCL1 gene): Allele 1 => b, allele 2 => b, dominant gene => b The color determined by the EYCL1 gene is blue, but that determined by the EYCL3 gene is brown.
					
					Finally, this individual would have brown eyes because the gene EYCL3 (having value B) will be dominant on the EYCL1 gene (having value b).  The notion of "undefined" color corresponds to an individual whose eye color is unknown. This means that he can possess one of the sixteen possible combinations that can determine the color of his eyes.  Of the sixteen possible combinations: twelve correspond to the brown color, three to the green color, and one to the blue color.  Here are the sixteen possible combinations:  BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => BROWN Bb Gb => BROWN Bb bG => BROWN Bb bb => BROWN BB GG => BROWN BB Gb => BROWN BB bG => BROWN BB bb => BROWN Bb GG => GREEN Bb Gb => GREEN Bb bG => GREEN Bb bb => BLUE   When we know the color of an individual's eyes, we can determine the possible combinations corresponding to him.
The chromosomes of baby will be made up of one or the other of the alleles of each of the parents.  We can therefore calculate all the possible combinations determined by the eye color of each parent.  For example:  - For two parents with brown eyes, the number of possible combinations is 331776 !!! - For two parents with blue eyes, the number of possible combinations is now only 16 (but all equal to "bb bb").  Using this method of calculation, we find that two parents with blue eyes and / or green eyes can not have a child with brown eyes. Whereas in reality this could happen! Even if the possibilities are minimal, they prove the limits of this method of calculation.  It is for this reason that the calculator is "rigged" when the final result is displayed, in the event that both parents have green and or blue eyes, to indicate a minimum percentage of chance that the child could have brown eyes.           Frequently asked questions             What are the different elements that make up the eye?   The eye is an organ that detects light and is the basis of the sense of sight. Its function is to convert light energy into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the optic nerve. The human eye works in a very similar manner to that of most vertebrates and some molluscs.  It is made up of :    Of a lens, which is adjustable according to the distance;  Of a "diaphragm", called pupil, whose diameter is regulated by the iris;  And a light-sensitive tissue, which is the retina..    The light penetrates through the pupil, passes through the lens and is projected on the retina, where it is transformed, thanks to cells called photoreceptors, into nerve impulses that will be transported via the optic nerve to reach the brain.     Does the color of the eyes change with age?   The color or tint of the eyes of a human being changes very little during our existence, except during the first days of our lives when the color of our baby's eyes is not yet completely determined.  But some diseases, or serious accidents can slightly transform the color of our eyes.  Another cause of an individual's eye color change is the fact that some have an iris or melanin is not uniformly distributed, resulting in an iris of many colors. According to various external changes (such as sunlight), or physiological (blood pressure), the color perceived by people watching you may differ.     Can we change the color of his eyes?   The color of the eyes depends on the type and amount of pigment the iris has. This pigment, called melanin, is a natural eye protection against ultraviolet rays.  During the evolution of the human species, over the centuries, a greater amount of melanin has developed in the sunnier areas (brown eyes, black eyes, brown eyes) and less melanin (gray eyes, blue eyes, green eyes) in the less luminous areas.  Many people, for aesthetic reasons, want to change the color of their eyes and the only way is the use of cosmetic contact lenses which, if they are well adapted, is a safe method.     What is the percentage of people with brown, green or blue eyes?   The distribution of the color of the eyes of human beings on our planet is far from homogeneous. This distribution varies enormously according to the geographical areas and ethnic groups represented.  The eye colors vary from blue, green brown, amber, brown, almost black, gray or even multicolored! But we can classify them into three main categories: blue, green and brown.  The most represented color in the world is the brown color, with about 75% of the world's population, then comes the color of blue eyes with about 23% and finally the color green with less than 2%.     What are the laws of Mendelian genetics?   Mendel's laws were developed by a genetic researcher, considered the father of genetics: Gregor Mendel. This scientist has conducted experiments that have elucidated the fundamental elements of heredity, an example of Mendel's law is the prediction of the traits of descendants by the characteristics of the parents of an animal or plant species.  This scientist has been inventing some of the most well known terms of genetics, such as the terms "dominant" and "recessive", which are hereditary factors present in the characteristics and hereditary traits of organisms across the three laws from Mendel. Which are: "Law of uniformity of the first generation hybrids", "Law of disjunction of the alleles" and "Law of independent segregation of the multiple hereditary characters".     Where does the color of green eyes come from?   Green eyes are the product of moderate amounts of melanin. Green is an intermediate color between brown tones and blue or gray tones.  The genes involved are EYCL1 and EYCL3. Thus, the dominant allele for EYCL1, conjugated to any allele for EYCL3, with the exception of the dominant allele of the latter, leads to the green color of the eyes. It is native to Europe and only 2% of the world's population has this eye color.     What is the origin of the color of blue eyes?   Soon after birth, many babies have blue eyes, even if their parents have brown eyes, because the melanin proteins responsible for the pigmentation of the iris have not all been released yet.  It is the variation of the levels of this pigment, associated with the effect of light interference, which gives birth to all the colors of the eyes that we know. Depending on the amount of melanin present, the eye may appear dark brown, light, nutty, green, gray or blue.  In 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen discovered a particular genetic mutation regulating a protein needed for melanin production.  According to Hans Eiberg, who led the research, this genetic discovery suggests that all the blue-eyed people around us today are the descendants of a single human being, who would probably have lived between the ages of 6,000 and 10,000.  Eidberg argues that all people had brown eyes until this genetic mutation in the OCA2 gene triggers a process that literally "extinguishes" the ability to produce the brown color in the iris.  However, before this gene was discovered, Francis Galton was already curious about the origin of blue eye color, as Hugh Aldersey-Williams explains in his book Anatomies:  « A briefcase with sixteen numbered glass eyes of different colors was constructed. The eyes have been arranged in a sheet of molded metal so as to provide each eye with eyelids and an eyebrow, a surreal dread occurs when the briefcase is opened for the first time. Galton had to make sure that the color labels he had chosen from the "wide variety of terms" used by compilers of family registers were the most important in nature. He did not choose brown or blue, as we usually do, but categories of light and dark, dividing those with "hazel" eyes into both fields. Then he compared the children with their parents and grandparents, using abundantly their usual statistical storm, but found nothing more remarkable to say at the end of his observation is that the blue and brown eyes persist for generations. »  It seems that people with blue or green eyes are more likely to suffer from skin cancer, especially melanoma. In reality, being a person with white skin and blue eyes is an anomaly that has been produced by very specific conditions.  About 20% of the population has blue eyes. They are relatively common in Europe, with more marked areas in the Nordic and Eastern countries where the majority of the population has blue eyes.     Can we have one eye of one color and the other of another?   Yes, but it's pretty rare. Studies show that fewer than 11 out of a thousand people have different colored eyes.  This strange feature is due to several factors, and can change over time. The color of the iris develops during the first months after birth, melanin levels in the iris determine the color of the eyes. But sometimes the concentration and distribution of melanin are not uniform in both eyes, leading to a known phenomenon called heterochromia.  This anomaly can occur in different ways:   Complete heterochromia, when each eye is of a clearly different color, for example, a blue and other brown eye.  Central heterochromia, when the eyes have many colors, like a blue iris with a yellow-brown ring around the pupil.  And sectoral heterochromia, when the iris has a touch of color different from its general tone.  Alterations in eye pigmentation are not necessarily indicative of an underlying medical problem, but are the common features of many hereditary genetic disorders. But sometimes the formation of tumors inside the eye can cause heterochromia.     Why do babies have blue eyes at birth?   The color of the eye is due to the amount of melanin that the iris contains. It is a protein secreted by melanocytes that stain the iris, hair and skin.  In the newborn, the melanin-producing cells, the melanocytes, are still immature and produce melanin in small amounts. Over the months, this melanin production increases and darkens the skin, hair and eyes. There is a popular belief, which links the light color of the baby's eyes to the duration of breastfeeding. In other words, some people think that the light color of the baby's eyes is caused by breastfeeding. In fact, there is no scientific basis for this belief. The average duration of breastfeeding being 6 to 9 months, this could coincide with the darkening of the eyes of a baby depending on the maturation of melanocytes. But there appears to be a relationship between sun exposure and activation of melanin production by melanocytes. In some adults, the color of their eyes has changed as a function of their exposure to the sun. But the final color of a baby's eyes is defined genetically even though some external factors such as light are likely to influence it. After birth, if the melanocytes secrete a small amount of melanin, the baby will have blue eyes. If this amount is a bit higher, the baby's eyes will be green, honey or hazel. And if the secretion of melanin is greater, the baby's eyes will be brown, dark brown or black.     Can a blue-eyed mother and father have a brown-eyed baby?      Can two parents with brown eyes have a baby with blue eyes?      What are all the colors of the existing eyes?      What is the rarest eye color?

For starters, people describe this magnificent eye color in many different ways. Some say it looks like hazelnut, while others call it golden or brownish green. One of the reasons it's so hard to describe hazel-colored eyes is that the hue itself seems to change, depending on what you wear and the type of lighting you are in.  To complicate matters further, although hazel eyes appear to contain hues of green, amber and even blue, these color pigments don't exist in the human eye. So where does this stunning color come from?  What Determines Eye Color?  Most of us were taught in high school science class that we inherit our eye color from our parents, and that brown eye color is dominant and blue is recessive (so two parents with blue eyes cannot have a child with brown eyes because neither parent carries the dominant form of the gene for brown eyes).                   Hazel eyes often have a mixture of green, brown and amber hues. Their color can be hard to describe, since ambient lighting and clothing colors can affect your perception of them. [Enlarge]     But it turns out the story is more complicated than that.  More recent research has shown that up to 16 genes (not just one or two) may influence eye color, which makes predicting eye color much more difficult.  Due to variations in the interaction and expression of multiple genes, it's hard to say for sure what color a child's eyes will be based on the color of his or her parents' eyes. For example, we now know it's possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a child with brown eyes  something the old model of eye color inheritance would have deemed impossible.

Also, eye color can change dramatically in the first few years of life; many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes and then develop brown, green or hazel eyes in childhood. This phenomenon has little to do with genetics, but it does help explain where hazel eyes come from.  What Causes Hazel Eyes?  The pigmented structure inside the eye that surrounds the pupil and gives eyes their color is called the iris . The pigment responsible for eye color is called melanin, which also affects skin color.  The reason many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes is that they don't have the full amount of melanin present in their irises at birth. In the first few years of life, more melanin often develops in the iris, causing blue eyes to turn green, hazel or brown.  Babies whose eyes turn from blue to brown develop significant amounts of melanin. Those who end up with green eyes or hazel eyes develop a little less.  Babies of African-American, Hispanic and Asian ethnicities usually are born with dark eyes that stay brown throughout life. This is because these individuals naturally have more melanin in their eyes and skin, compared with non-Hispanic whites.     Light Absorption And Scattering  Remember, there are no blue, green or hazel pigments in the eye. Eyes merely have different amounts of melanin, which is dark brown.  So how can a dark brown pigment create blue, green or hazel eyes? This is possible because of two processes:   Melanin in the iris absorbs different wavelengths of light entering the eye.  Light is scattered and reflected by the iris, and some wavelengths (colors) scatter more easily than others.   Eyes with high concentrations of melanin absorb more light entering the eye, so less is scattered and reflected back from the iris. The result is a brown eye color.  In eyes with lower concentrations of melanin, less light is absorbed, and more is scattered and reflected by the iris. Since light rays with shorter wavelengths (blue and green light) scatter more easily than light rays with longer wavelengths (red light), eyes with less light-absorbing melanin appear green or hazel, and eyes with low concentrations of melanin appear blue.  Also, the distribution of melanin can vary in different parts of the iris, causing hazel eyes to appear light brown near the pupil and more green in the periphery of the iris.  Hazel Eyes Are A Work Of Art  Hazel eye color is both complex and magnificent, since its specific features are determined by so many factors  including the amount and distribution of melanin in the iris, how scattering of light by the iris and pigment molecules affects color, and how perception of eye color is influenced by lighting and the color of our clothing and surroundings.  Just as it takes many strokes of the artist's brush to produce a masterpiece, hazel eyes involve the dynamics of several elements to create the unique work of art that's represented in every hazel eye.  If you wear eyeglasses, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating to eliminate distracting reflections in your glasses and allow others to see the beauty of your hazel eye color.  Change Your Eye Color To Hazel  If your eyes aren't naturally hazel, but you've always wanted them to be, you can achieve your wish with color contact lenses. They won't actually change your eye color, of course, just the appearance of it.  Want to try hazel eye color? Ask your eye care professional for a prescription for color contact lenses. [Enlarge]   Contact lenses are available in many colors, so you'll have a choice of several shades of hazel. But it's not simply a matter of choosing a lens color you like; the natural color of your eyes has a role in determining which lenses you should wear.  If you have very light eyes, you might be able to use a lens with an "enhancement tint." This lens has a translucent color that lets some of your natural color show through. It's meant to enhance your natural eye color  to make your light blue eyes a deeper blue, for example  but if your eyes are light enough, you might achieve the hazel you want with an enhancement tint.  More likely, you'll need an "opaque tint." These lenses are designed to mask your natural color with a solid version of the color you desire. They're often used when the color you want to achieve is lighter than your natural color.  An eye care professional can show you various colors and help you make the right choice. Remember, contact lenses are a prescription item, and if you don't already wear contacts, you'll need an eye exam and a prescription before getting them  even if your lenses don't need any corrective power in them.
