That's what I have - it never occurred to me that it was rare until I saw it mentioned in an article.  Just curious how many others there are on the BHB.    From: www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emmakelly/...    4. Red hair and blue eyes is the rarest combination in the world  The majority of natural redheads have brown eyes, with others likely to have hazel or green shades.  But like red hair, blue eye colour is a recessive trait, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for a child to be blessed with it. This makes those with red hair and blue eyes the rarest minority in the world, with only 1% having both.  So, each one is about as rare as a four-leaf clover.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

By Susan Donaldson James  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Susan   March 17, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Courtesy of Brian Braiker Brian Braiker, a banjo player in the band, the "DeLorean Sisters," is often mistaken as Irish because of his red hair.  0 Shares               Email      Redheads, as they say, wear the map of Ireland all over their faces. Sorry, ginger-haired English Prince Harry. And the statistics bear that stereotype out. Ireland has the highest per capita percentage of redheads in the world -- anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, according to Eupedia , a website that explores European genetics and ancestry. They are almost equally prevalent in Scotland and other pockets of Celtic pride. A slightly lower percentage hail from Cornwall in England and western parts of Switzerland. Red hair is associated with the gene MC1R, a recessive and somewhat rare gene that occurs in only about 2 percent of the world's population, according to the National Institutes of Health . That means both parents must carry a copy of the gene to produce a red-haired child and often the trait skips generations. Rarest of all are redheads with blue eyes. The majority have brown eyes or hazel or green shades. Brian Braiker, executive editor of Digiday , who answered an ABCNews.com call for redheads with, "Better red than dead," said he is "always" mistaken for an Irishman. Ethnically, he is nearly all Ashkenazi Jew, except for a maternal grandmother who is Norwegian. Not surprising. Why do you think they called the plundering Scandinavian Erik the Red? Genetic genealogy has revealed a high percentage of people from southwest Norway coincide with a paternal lineage known as haplogroup Rib-L21, including its subclade, Rib-M222, which is typical of northern Ireland. Genealogists speculate that may be because the Vikings took Celtic slaves from Ireland to that part of Norway. Braiker, 6-foot, 3-inches tall, with his brown eyes and full-fledged auburn beard, said he didn't have an easy time of it growing up a redhead. His coloring was nothing like his dark-haired father and light-haired mother. "I endured jokes, 'Are you the milkman's son?' and 'Were you adopted,'" Braiker, 39, told ABCNews.com. The gene apparently skipped a generation or two, as he confides his father's grandfather and a maternal cousin also had red hair. One ancestry company, BritainsDNA , now offers parents the chance to see if they carry the recessive gene by sending in their saliva for testing. If both do, they have a one in four chance of conceiving a redhead. BritainsDNA conducted the biggest study of redhead genetics in the country, with more than 2,300 people who have undergone DNA tests. Redheads like Braiker are more sensitive to hot and cold . And one 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed they need about 20 percent more anesthesia to knock them out for surgery. "I have had dental work and a graft done years ago on the roof of my mouth and it is still sensitive to temperature," he said. "I have also been a life-long wussy." Redheads are also better at making their own vitamin D, which helps protect against osteoporosis, because their bodies are more efficient at soaking up sunlight, according to Yahoo Health . Scottish researcher Jonathan Rees suggests the "ginger gene" may have helped protect redheads from rickets. According to an article in Huffington Post UK , redheads share some other interesting traits: their hair is harder to dye than other shades; they have fewer, but thicker strands of hair' and they go gray more slowly. But there are also health disadvantages. The color of human skin, hair and eyes is dictated by two types of melanin pigment that are produced in the upper layers of the skin: pheomelanin, which is reddish-yellow, and eumelanin, which is brownish-black.    A 2012 study from the journal Nature , found that the pigment pheomelanin, which gives hair the red color, makes redheads more susceptible to the melanoma than fair-skinned blonds, even when they cover up their skin. "What happens in the sun?" asked Braiker. "I stay out of it. The sun is not my friend. I get more freckles and I should wear a ridiculously high SPF on my face." Growing up had its challenges, he said, but eventually there were social advantages to being a redhead. "Over a lifetime, I have developed thick skin," said Braiker. "Growing up I was advanced a year in kindergarten or grade 1," he explained. "So I was a year younger with red hair and a little bit weaker than the rest. I was easy prey." He grew his hair long in college, even sporting a red afro, and continued to get cat calls from strangers: "What's up carrot top?" and "Ronald McDonald." But, he said, it made him tougher. "I always felt a little bit like a freak," said Braiker. "But over time, I learned to embrace the weirdness and it did help shape my personality. ... And there are definitely ladies who like redheads."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

"Redhead" redirects here. For other uses, see Redhead (disambiguation) .     Woman with red hair       Man with red hair    Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1]  Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2]  Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered.  The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510.

Redheads today are commonly associated with the Celtic nations [4] and to a far lesser extent the Germanic peoples.  In Ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is estimated to be at around 10%, [5] making it the most red-haired country in the world. According to Britain's DNA, 34.7% of the Irish population carry the allele for red hair, although this doesn't directly translate proportionally into births of red-haired children. [6]  Scotland also has a very high percentage with around 6% of the population having red hair. [7] [8] Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA study used a sample of 2,343 people, and found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, with 35% overall carrying the allele and Edinburgh having the highest proportion at 40%. [7] [8] [9] The largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. [10]  England has a red hair prevalence of around 4%, with 28.5% of population having the allele; [7] while in Wales 38% of Welsh people carry the red-haired allele. [7] A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits from Great Britain found higher levels of red hair in Wales and the Scottish border counties of England . [fn 1] [11]  Eastern and Southern Europe     A Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale , c. 30 BC    Carleton Coon's 1939 book The Races of Europe stated that rufosity (reddish hair) often occurred in Montenegrins . [12] [13] [14]  In Italy , red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. [15] In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. [15]  Victorian era  ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga to be "the most red-headed men in the world", [16] a claim which has a solid basis even today, as the Volga region has more redheads per population than anywhere else in the world with the exception of Ireland . [17]  North Africa and Mediterranean      Hades abducting Persephone , fresco in the small royal tomb at Vergina , Macedonia, Greece , c. 340 BC    The Berber populations of Morocco [18] and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, [19] [20] [21] respectively. The Queen of Morocco , Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI , has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. [22] In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. [23] Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards . [24] In European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition , all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. [25] In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. [27] The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. [28]  Asia (all regions)     A Uyghur girl in Kashgar , China 's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair    In Asia, genetic red hair is rare, but reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair can be found in the Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine ), in Turkey , in Caucasia , in Northern Kazakhstan , among Uyghurs and among Indo-Iranians . [ editorializing ] The use of henna on hair and skin for various reasons occasionally occurs in Asia. When henna is used on hair it dyes the hair to different shades of red. [29] [30]  Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa  Emigration from Europe has multiplied the population of red haired humans in the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In the United States , it is estimated that 2–6% of the population has red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 420,000 in Ireland and 300,000 in Scotland. [7]  Historical     Woman with mixed reddish-brown hair, Papua New Guinea . Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair. [31]    Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. [32] The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red-haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. [33] [34]  In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians , who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China . Caucasian  Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC . [35]  Reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians , and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. [36] [37]  Biochemistry and genetics     A close-up view of red hair        Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum , made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii).    The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.  The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome  16 . Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer.  The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is unable to tan . Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not all-inclusive feature of red-haired people. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant [2] .  Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.  Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production. [38]  Genetics  The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His , and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. [39] The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA ) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. [40] [41]  In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.  Evolution  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. [42] In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift . [39]  Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. [43] [44]  A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans. [45]  Extinction hoax  See also: Disappearing blonde gene  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail , which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. [46] Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble , and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away". [47]  Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future. [47]  Medical implications of the red hair gene  Melanoma  Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning , but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage . Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. [48] It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. [49]  Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [50] [51]  Pain tolerance and injury  Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), [52] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. [53] [54] [55]  Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic . [56] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. [57] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide . [55]  The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins . (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC , and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. [58] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin , but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. [58] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.  There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. [59] [60] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising . [60]  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:   In cases of severe malnutrition , normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde . The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor , is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine .  One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea , results in red hair and red-colored skin. [61]  Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin . [61] [62]   Culture     Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum , late 1st-century BC to mid-1st century AD [63]       Polychrome Roman marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum    In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.      Portrait of a Lady , ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli        Elizabeth I of England , ca. 1588    Beliefs about temperament  A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables , a character says of Anne Shirley , the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye , Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair."  During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament . [64] In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda , redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.  Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels , "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms ," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that "neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo ] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe". [65] Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero . They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads. [66]  Media, fashion and art     "The Accolade" by Edmund Blair Leighton    Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman , Alyson Hannigan , Marcia Cross , Christina Hendricks , Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. [ citation needed ]  Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India , Iran , Bangladesh and Pakistan , henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance. [67]  Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color " Titian " takes its name from the artist Titian , who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli 's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites , Edmund Leighton , Modigliani , [68] and Gustav Klimt . [69]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes story " The Red-Headed League " (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor .  Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Red Sonja , Mystique , and Poison Ivy . [70]  Prejudice and discrimination against redheads  Medieval beliefs      Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral    Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers ( Der Eisenhans ) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper , in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk . [71]  Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum , [72] notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch , a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;   Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red.   Medieval antisemitism      Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd'    During the Spanish Inquisition , people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. [25] In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus , and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin . [27] The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. [28] The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David . The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau , even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'. [73]  Modern-day discrimination  "Carrot head" redirects here. For the French novel, see Poil de carotte .  In his 1885 book I Say No , Wilkie Collins wrote "The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair."  In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham , Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: "The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, "Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head," and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man." [74]  In British English , the word "ginger" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), [75] with terms such as "gingerphobia" [76] and "gingerism" [77] used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as "carrot tops" and "carrot heads". (The comedian " Carrot Top " uses this stage name .) "Gingerism" has been compared to racism , although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. [77]  Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for "being ginger". [78] In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; [79] in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne , was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair. [80] In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. [81] In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him "just because he had red hair". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. [82]  This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show . The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp , who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. [83] The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis ) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. [84] [85] ) Comedian Tim Minchin , himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song "Prejudice". [86]  The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the " Ginger Kids ", " Le Petit Tourette ", " It's a Jersey Thing " and " Fatbeard " episodes of South Park .  Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. [87] However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; "Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd," says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons . [88]  In Australian slang , redheads are often nicknamed "Blue" or "Bluey". [89] More recently, they have been referred to as "rangas" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. [90] The word "rufus" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; [91] based on a variant of rufous , a reddish-brown color.  In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a "National Kick a Ginger Day" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. [92]  In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words: " Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones " after customers complained the card was offensive. [93]  In October 2010, Harriet Harman , the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a "ginger rodent". [94] Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was "proud to be ginger". [95] Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. [96]  In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks , announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination . [97]  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo ( Chinese : 红毛 ; pinyin : hóng máo ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : âng-mo͘ ) in Hokkien ( Min Nan ) Chinese means "red-haired", [98] and is used in Malaysia and Singapore to refer to white people. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui ( 红毛鬼 ) meaning "red-haired devil", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo ("foreign devil"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. [99] Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. [100] Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times , [101] and in television programmes and films.  The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō ( 紅毛 ), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku , its 200-year period of isolation. [102]  Red hair festivals     Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day , September 2007    There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival is paid for by the local government in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands. [103] It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. Today, the festival includes music, fashion shows, art exhibitions and a picnic [104]  The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. [105]  A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. [106]  Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot) , held for the local Israeli red hair community, [107] including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. [108] However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. [109] The organizers state; "The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.” [109]  The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. [110]  Religious and mythological traditions  In the Iliad , Achilles ' hair is described as ξανθῆς [111] ( ksanthēs ) , usually translated as blonde, or golden [112] but sometimes as red or tawny. [113] [114] His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. [115]  The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. [116]     Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys    The Hebrew word usually translated "ruddy" or "reddish-brown" ( admoni  אדמוני , from the root ADM אדם , see also Adam and Edom ) [117] [118] [119] [120] was used to describe both Esau and David .  Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.  Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture [121] [122] and in the works of William Shakespeare , [123] reinforcing the negative stereotype.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

That's what I have - it never occurred to me that it was rare until I saw it mentioned in an article.  Just curious how many others there are on the BHB.    From: www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emmakelly/...    4. Red hair and blue eyes is the rarest combination in the world  The majority of natural redheads have brown eyes, with others likely to have hazel or green shades.  But like red hair, blue eye colour is a recessive trait, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for a child to be blessed with it. This makes those with red hair and blue eyes the rarest minority in the world, with only 1% having both.  So, each one is about as rare as a four-leaf clover.

TamokoJapan    Last edited 06/13/2015      Just curious for those of you with half Japanese and half Caucasian children, what hair color and what eye colors do your children have? Do your children look like each other? And what hair/eye color does the Caucasian parent have? We're having a half-European girl in August and I'm so curious as to what she might potentially look like! I'm European mixed with medium/dark brown hair and blue eyes (DH is Japanese).  I'm guessing the chance of blue eyes is very, very low, so either green or brown would be most likely. We are all different, but I'm still curious!

Our eldest has hazel eyes (were grey as a baby) and dark brown hair. Youngest has brown eyes basically from the start. Not enough hair to tell yet, haha.

Dh is black hair, dark brown eyes and medium-fair complexion (I'd call it a golden) with some Caucasian ancestry that includes red hair and green eyes.  Our baby turned out blue eyed, my brown hair but with red lights in it, and even fairer complexion than I have. I think it depends really on if the Japanese parent has any Caucasian ancestry but he and his parents were really surprised lol    --  Annabelle Rose 02/13/15              Reply            Report this comment       0                     TamokoJapan · Original Poster    Last edited 06/14/2015     Awesome, thanks for the replies! My cousin (Caucasian) had a baby with his Japanese wife and the baby has blue eyes, but I know that baby's eyecolor changes a lot and doesn't "settle" for like 9 months? And since Asian genes/brown eyes are very dominant, I assume most blue eyes don't actually stay blue for babies who are 50% ore more Japanese.  I also read the blue Mongolian spots are very usual for hafus. I'm actually worried, because my side of the family is white and most of them probably don't even know what it is... If she gets it, I'll have to always make sure to explain it's a birth mark and not child abuse. :/               Reply            Report this comment       0                     bubsdubs    Posted 06/14/2015       TamokoJapan said:    Awesome, thanks for the replies!

Also Mongolian spot is actually not just an asain trait and most Drs outside of Japan will know what it is. None of my kids had it, but my nephew (1/4 Japanese) did!

Unless your DH  (dear husband) has submissive genes that aren't showing up (ie mixed heritage himself) there is no chance of having a blonde blue eyed haafu unless its a mutation. I'm half Asian myself and my girls have blue eyes and medium brown hair because I have those recessive genes.

But they all turn dark-green or brown, depending on the genes. Brown eyes are so dominating, especially with Asian genes.  Everyone in my family have blue eyes, but my grandmother has brown and I think that's how I ended up with one blue and one green.

04/22/2014  Yes, DH is very much a redhead. Or at least was. He's turning blonde now he's getting old. Gingers apparently turn blonde rather than white haired when they age.      Lol! He probably got the hair from Dh then. I'd say chances aren't that slim after all, which isn't a bad thing, bean is absolutely gorgeous. But then again I'm no expert. I'm just going off of what I've researched. Before LO  (little one) was born I was dead set that he'd be a redhead since it runs heavy in my family. So I looked up the odds all I got was what I already said about the recessive gene.

No one in my family has red hair. They are all Italian and dark hair or blonde hair. My husbands dads uncle is the only one that had red hair. Everyone else had brown or blonde. None of the other grandkids have red hair except one. It ran on her moms side of the family though. So I figured that's where she got her red hair. Just didn't know what the chances are. Especially since it doesn't run in my family. My two boys have light brown and dark brown hair. Just curious as to what you think??

Of course, I thought my kids would all have brown hair and brown eyes like me and my entire family.  One girl does.  The other has straw blonde hair and bright blue eyes.  Genetics is a weird thing.  I do keep joking that this one will have red hair just because the other two look nothing alike but it actually is possible in our case.  My DH's grandfather had bright red hair and my grandmother had auburn.  We'll know on Monday!    --  May 2006 , April 2009 , June 2013             Reply            Report this comment       0                     ashley&chuck; · Original Poster    Posted 05/30/2013      SamiCrow I DON'T want a red head that's why I am asking this question.

Hubby had blonde hair when he was little so that part makes sense, but for a while everyone teased that he wasnt ours. :) Im really excited to see what color hair this one will have!    --  Wife to an amazing husband and father since 6/26/2010 Baby boy born 2/20/2012 Baby girl born 6/11/2013             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 5      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

JDMcM    Posted 12/22/2011      I realize eye and hair color can change over time but I am feeling a little uncomfortable that my daughter was born with red hair and blue eyes. My husband has very dark and dominant genes and so far, she looks nothing like him. She looks only a little bit like me but only because of her fair skin. My hair is brown/blond and eyes are hazel. My first was born with brown eyes and dark hair. Because this baby was not, people keep jokingly questioning whether or not my husband is the father. He always said that if we had a non-brown eyed baby, he might be concerned.  Anyone else have children with features drastically different? I keep wondering what the chances/odds are she'll end up looking a little more like him.     --  Mother to beautiful baby girl, Deviney. 10.10.09             Comment            Report this post       0          Comments (24)        / 3                   cmac609    Posted 12/22/2011      Most babies are born with blue eyes.

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I have red hair and blue eyes, both of my parents have blue eyes but light brown hair, My husband had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes, his parents both have dark brown hair and his mom has blue eyes and his dad has brown...my question is, if we have a child what are its chances of having blue eyes or red hair?        -A curious adult from Ohio   February 16, 2006  The chances for green or blue eyes are around 50% ( click here for the details). The chances for red hair depend entirely on whether or not your husband carries a hidden red hair gene. If he does, then there is most likely a 50-50 shot for a redhead. If he doesn't, then the chances are close to zero ( click here for more details).  So, if your husband is a carrier for red hair, then your chances for a redhead with blue or green eyes is 1 in 4 (we separate out the two below). If he isn't a carrier, then chances are pretty close to zero for a blue-eyed child with red hair. Let's see where I got those numbers.   Eye color : As I said earlier, your chances for a child with blue or green eyes are around 50%. These chances are based on an eye color model where two genes determine eye color.  The first gene is the brown-blue gene, bey2. It comes in two forms, a brown (B) and a blue one (b). Brown is dominant over blue which means if either or both of your copies of this gene are B, then you have brown eyes (remember, we have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad).  OK, so we know you are for sure bb (both copies are blue); that is the only way to get blue eyes. And we know your husband has at least one B since he has brown eyes.  But what about the other copy of his brown-blue gene? It is often hard to figure out if someone is a blue eye carrier. However, because his mom has blue eyes, we know he got a b from her. In other words, he is Bb -- a brown-eyed carrier of blue eyes.  So what does this mean for your children? It means that you will always pass a blue eye version (b) and that your husband will pass one onto his kids half the time. Your kids have a 50-50 shot of not having brown eyes.  We can't rule out that they'll have green eyes, though. This is because there is a 2nd gene, a green-blue gene (gey) that is involved as well. It comes in two forms, a green (G) and a blue (b) one.  One more thing, the brown version of bey2 is dominant over the green version of gey, which is dominant over the blue versions of both genes. In other words, brown trumps green and blue, and green trumps blue.  We don't know your husband's green gene status because we don't know his dad's green gene status (we know yours because you have blue eyes). Because his mom had blue eyes, we know she is bb for the green-blue gene. Which means your husband has at least one b.  If your husband is Gb, then each child has a 1 in 4 chance for blue eyes, a 1 in 4 chance for green, and a 1 in 2 chance for brown. If he is bb for the green-blue gene, then your kids have a 50-50 shot at blue and a 50-50 shot at brown eyes. Our answer here hopefully makes this all more clear.  Your two possible eye color scenarios:  1) Your husband is a carrier for green eyes (BbGb)    2) Your husband is not a carrier for green eyes (Bbbb)     A word of warning. As complicated as this is, it doesn't explain everything about eye color. There are cases where blue-eyed parents have green or brown-eyed kids even though this is impossible by this model.  These sorts of things happen often enough that it probably isn't due just to new mutations in their eye color genes. There are probably genes we just don't know about that are involved in eye color. Click here to learn about how these might work.   Red hair : Red hair is often a very simple dominant/recessive case. What I mean is that a certain gene called MC1R comes in two forms, a nonred (R) and a red (r) form. R is dominant over r.  As a redhead, you are rr, you will always pass a red hair gene down to your kids. But what about your husband? He could be either an RR or an Rr, it is impossible to know right now.  Well, that isn't strictly true. If he could have one gene, MC1R, sequenced, he would have a pretty good idea about whether or not he is a carrier. Unfortunately, no one is currently offering this service*. Some, but not all carriers of the red hair gene have freckles so this can be a hint. But there are people without freckles who carry a red hair gene too (me, for example).  So, let's say your husband is a carrier. Then we are in a similar position to blue eyes. You will always pass on an r version of the MC1R gene. All of your kids will at least be carriers.  Your husband has a 50-50 shot of passing on the red hair version, r. Those kids that get the r from your husband will be redheads. Those who get the R will be carriers.  If your husband is RR, then most likely none of your kids will end up redheads. They will all be carriers of the red hair gene (from you) but not redheads themselves.  OK, so let's put it all together:  Husband genotype  Chance for Red hair/Blue eyes   Bb Gb Rr  1 in 8 (12.5%)   Bb bb Rr  1 in 4 (25%)   Bb Gb RR  Little or none   Bb bb RR  Little or none  Now again, none of this is as simple as I've stated so far. There are some people with red hair whose MC1R gene has no DNA changes. So there are other genes that can cause red hair as well. And there are some DNA changes in only one copy of MC1R that appear to cause red hair even when the other copy has no changes.  However, from the work done thus far, the idea that you end up with red hair when both copies of your MC1R gene are mutated explains around 2/3 of red hair. Pretty good by genetic standards!

Your life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits!     All eyes are beautiful eyes , but if you're part of the majority of people who have brown eyes, you've probably dreamed of something more exotic. Maybe dark hair and gray eyes was the rare hair and eye color combination you wished for, and while that's a match we'd have to agree is pretty stunning, the title of rarest hair and eye color combination belongs to another group.  According to Medical Daily , blue-eyed redheads take the prize for rarest hair and eye color combination. Both genes for blue eyes and red hair are recessive, so if you can remember back to high school biology and Punnett Squares , you'll know just how rare this combo is.  So, how common is the red hair and blue eyes combo? Only two percent of the world population — about 140 million in 7.6 billion — has red hair. Blue eyes, on the other hand, are a lot more common: About 17 percent of the world population has blue eyes. Ignoring genetic factors that make people of a certain race more likely than others to have this hair and eye color combination, you're looking at 12.75 million people on this planet with red hair and blue eyes.  If that number is hard to imagine, just remember that you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime (0.03 percent) than of meeting a redhead with blue eyes (0.017 percent).  Who knew? And while you rack your brains trying to think of redheads with blue eyes that you know, we'll go ahead and tell you that many of your favorite celebrities with red hair aren't natural redheads!

Bees are, apparently, more attracted to people with red hair , and a 2017 study found natural redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. That said, it's not all bad news. A German researcher named Werner Habermehl found redheads have more sex than their blonde and brunette counterparts.  h/t Reader's Digest  Get fuller-looking hair with eyeshadow!

By: Rosemary O. Fernandez Around this time last year, I got the best news of my life: My husband and I were expecting a baby! We kept it to ourselves for a while, but soon told our family and friends. As I inevitably expanded, I was asked the inevitable question: Will the little one have red hair too? This was a perfectly reasonable question as I was born with screaming red hair –the kind of shade that has prompted numerous strangers to tell me I have the map of Ireland written on my face despite the fact that I’m mostly Italian. I inherited these locks from my (Italian) mother, and my husband’s mother and grandfather are also gingers. Needless to say, the odds were in the little guy’s favor. Thirty-eight weeks slugged by, and I’d estimate that I heard the question about three times a week. Coworkers joked about it. Family members hoped for it. Random people at the grocery store thought it would be terrific. Naturally all my husband and I prayed for was a healthy child. Whether he popped out with red, blonde, brown, or green hair, we’d cuddle and dote on him just the same. But I’d be lying if I said I never crossed my fingers and daydreamed about strolling down the street with a fiery-headed toddler in tow. Here are some facts to see if  you will have a redhead baby: 1. In order for a baby to have red hair, both parents have to carry the gene, since it’s a recessive trait. So if you’re a ginger and you marry a ginger, odds are, your kids will be gingers, too. If only one parent has the locks but the other is a carrier, the baby’s chances are 50/50. If neither of you are red but you both are carriers, you have a one in four chance of a fiery-haired child. And, sorry to say, if only one parent is not a carrier (even though the other is), you’ve got no shot. [ Source ] 2. Even though you might not be a redhead yourself, studies estimate that 25 percent of Caucasian Americans carry the ginger gene, so if you fall into this category you might end up with a redheaded baby when you’re least expecting it. [ Source ] READ: 10 Things To Know If You’re a Redhead Baby My reasons weren’t purely aesthetic, because for me, my hair color is a huge part of my personality. I’m confident. I’m intelligent. I’m friendly. I’m funny (though my husband says it’s usually when I don’t mean to be). Growing up, my hair helped me cultivate these qualities. I’m used to strangers addressing me simply because they want to pay me a compliment about my hair; therefore I have no problem doing the same to someone else when I like their outfit or a speech they presented. On the first day of school when teachers called my name, they also told me they liked my hair; hence I became comfortable in a classroom from an early age, absorbed more information, and was never too timid to raise my hand when I knew the answer. I’m often the only redheaded in my group of friends, so I developed a good sense of direction; since I’m the most easily spotted in a crowd, my pals often followed me when we were out. Here are some other fun facts about redheads in general: Enjoy those baby blues while they last. The world’s rarest hair and eye color combo is red hair and blue eyes. [ Source ]  number 4 on list ] Redheads are more likely to be left-handed. [ Source ] Redheaded babies are the cutest babies. Ok, this one’s just my opinion. READ: Facts About Redheads That May Surprise You I want all this and more for my child. More than I want to dress him in t-shirts that have fun redheaded slogans, I want him to be confident. I want him to know he’s smart. I want him to not be afraid to be kind. Though hair color doesn’t determine these qualities, I know from experience that it helps. Sixteen weeks after birth, what’s the verdict? The jury’s still out. The baby was born with dark hair. Those strands have now mostly fallen out, and it looks like some red is replacing it. Only time will tell. But I still have my fingers crossed. Rock it like a Redhead!

The real reason Blue is rare with redheads is because it is a rare color in general, and when combined with the rarity of red hair, it is one of the least common combinations.  Even if the second “fact” is true, don’t just call us mutants, we get offended.  The one about redheads being left handed is FALSE, your strong hand is the hand you learned to use most, I’m right handed, and in fact lost my left hand.  I am more sensitive to the cold than my sister, who is blonde.  This might not be true for all reds, but I do consider myself to be a hot-head.  About being easy to find, it all depends on the size of the crowd and ratio of redheads to others.  AND WHO THE HECK THOUGHT WE WERE VAMPIRES?!

My sense of humour and the amount that I laugh is often commented on. I love being around people and embrace the light hearted ridicule that I receive on a daily basis for being so different. I’m not hot headed, more laid back if anything. However I’m very passionate, loving and caring. I was very fourtunate not to be picked on at school, I guess I was a cool kid and got on with everyone (I’m 30 by the way). I wouldn’t suggest I am proud to be a red head, just grateful to be loved for being me.               Malachai Smith  4 weeks ago  Reply    I’m a redheaded teen guy and I am not just a red-head ginger. I am on the full-on-fire-headed level and I have often been made fun of for it. To find that I am not the only one and that we can actually be appreciated is a huge blessing. Too often, I have been mocked and insulted in my hallways at school. So, to know that they are being stupid is awesome. My heart and my soul are so happy to find this community of red-heads.              24 Sensitivity to Hot and Cold   According to some studies, a side effect for redheads is that they are more sensitive to hot and cold pain than any other hair color.  23 Ginger King and Queen in Netherlands   Each September, the Netherlands holds a two-day celebration out of appreciation for redheads around the world which is called Roodharigendag in Dutch. The party includes crowning the ginger King and Queen.  22 Types of Redheads   There is a variety of red hair than you think. Red hair comes in so many different colors (Burnt Orange, Copper, Blonde, Ginger), sizes (Short and long) and shapes as other hair colors.  21 Behavior with Redheads in Past   They have been treated awfully in the past. Hitler was against the intermarriage of redheads believing that they produce more devil children.  20 Bee's attraction Towards Redheads   According to some studies bees are more attracted to redheads than any other hair color, probably it’s because they seem like sweet red flowers because of their red crown of hair.  19 Redheads are Hot-headed   Redheads are also known as hot-headed. However, there is no confirmation of this being valid. It might be just because of their red hair color they are called hot headed in a sense of joke.  18 Disney Princesses with Redhead   We also have redhead Disney Princesses like Merida and Ariel. It means that red hair color is too cool because, Ariel and Merida also want to be a part of the ginger world, but you cannot have them because they are too beautiful for this earth.  17 Easy to Found   Redheads never get lost in the crowd because of their red crown of hair which makes them unique from others which are cool.  16 Hardest Shade to Dye   According to a study, it is proved that Red is the hardest shade to dye your hair and also difficult to maintain it. So to be a redhead is a benefit.  15 Sense of Humor   Redheads have an impressive sense of humor because they grow up by teased for their ginger hair color.  14 Lower Rate of Prostate Cancer   To be a redhead is beneficial for men because according to some studies red headed men are 54 percent less likely to create prostate cancer. It means a lot for ginger men.  13 Redheads are Vampires   According to early Greeks believes Redheads were Vampires , and they also turn into vampires after they have died.  12 Less Hair Strands   Redheads have fewer hair than brunettes or blondes. According to research on an average, brunettes have 140,000 strands of hair; blondes have 110,000 strands of hair and redheads have 90,000 which is too less, but red hair is thicker than any other hair color.  11 Larger Dose of Anesthesia   In surgeries, it's been recommended that a few redheads require 20 percent larger doses of anesthesia as compared to a regular patient. Research proved this that redhead needs more anesthesia than people having other hair colors.  10 Absorption and Making of Vitamin D   They are more efficient at making Vitamin D . Redheads have the low amount of eumelanin in their body that is why they cannot absorb the required level of Vitamin D. In any case, they compensate for this by creating their particular Vitamin D when they are present in low-light condition.  So, they do not need as much sunlight to get what they need.  9 Concept of Christmas Communities   Christian communities considered a mark of the devil were birthmarks, patches and the major one was red hair. Many Christian communities believed that Judas was a redheaded textual proof from the Bible.  This belief really inspired some painters to paint Judas with red hair.  8 Aristotle Theory   Aristotle had some issues with redheads. Aristotle himself reported for the once saying "The reddish are of bad character" which shows that he hates redheads.  7 Resistant to Pain Blocker   Redheads are more resistant to pain blocker. Redhead gene releases a chemical called pheomelanin, which is the cause of blocks the brain’s receptivity/acceptance to pain.  6 Redheads are Genetic   Families can carry redhead gene for generations without knowing it. So, it is might possible that there could be some redhead gene inside you that can surprise you for being a redhead’s parent.  5 Temperature Sensors   Redheads are good at detecting changes in temperature than a person having any other hair color so, we can call them Temperature sensor.  4 Extinction of Redhead   According to research found by Britain DNA has found that more than 40 percent of the population carries the MC1R gene that is responsible for red hair . Redheads are not going to extinct because families have MC1R gene without knowing it.  3 Sensitive Teeth   According to some studies, redheads have more sensitive teeth. Redheads also bruise easily than those who have any other hair color.  2 Marilyn Monroe   Marilyn Monroe was also a redheaded. She was American actress and model. She was famous for her natural red hair.  1 Fall in Love with Redhead   Finally, if you look into redhead’s eye longer than 10 seconds, you will fall in love.  Redheads are always misunderstood and mistrust in the history. Previously, the people with red hair were considered to be an evil one, even nowadays many of us are having a lot of misconceptions about them.  Being a redhead is not an abnormality. Instead, it’s a blessing. If anyone of you has a redhead, then proud of it.

By Susan Donaldson James  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Susan   March 17, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Courtesy of Brian Braiker Brian Braiker, a banjo player in the band, the "DeLorean Sisters," is often mistaken as Irish because of his red hair.  0 Shares               Email      Redheads, as they say, wear the map of Ireland all over their faces. Sorry, ginger-haired English Prince Harry. And the statistics bear that stereotype out. Ireland has the highest per capita percentage of redheads in the world -- anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, according to Eupedia , a website that explores European genetics and ancestry. They are almost equally prevalent in Scotland and other pockets of Celtic pride. A slightly lower percentage hail from Cornwall in England and western parts of Switzerland. Red hair is associated with the gene MC1R, a recessive and somewhat rare gene that occurs in only about 2 percent of the world's population, according to the National Institutes of Health . That means both parents must carry a copy of the gene to produce a red-haired child and often the trait skips generations. Rarest of all are redheads with blue eyes. The majority have brown eyes or hazel or green shades. Brian Braiker, executive editor of Digiday , who answered an ABCNews.com call for redheads with, "Better red than dead," said he is "always" mistaken for an Irishman. Ethnically, he is nearly all Ashkenazi Jew, except for a maternal grandmother who is Norwegian. Not surprising. Why do you think they called the plundering Scandinavian Erik the Red? Genetic genealogy has revealed a high percentage of people from southwest Norway coincide with a paternal lineage known as haplogroup Rib-L21, including its subclade, Rib-M222, which is typical of northern Ireland. Genealogists speculate that may be because the Vikings took Celtic slaves from Ireland to that part of Norway. Braiker, 6-foot, 3-inches tall, with his brown eyes and full-fledged auburn beard, said he didn't have an easy time of it growing up a redhead. His coloring was nothing like his dark-haired father and light-haired mother. "I endured jokes, 'Are you the milkman's son?' and 'Were you adopted,'" Braiker, 39, told ABCNews.com. The gene apparently skipped a generation or two, as he confides his father's grandfather and a maternal cousin also had red hair. One ancestry company, BritainsDNA , now offers parents the chance to see if they carry the recessive gene by sending in their saliva for testing. If both do, they have a one in four chance of conceiving a redhead. BritainsDNA conducted the biggest study of redhead genetics in the country, with more than 2,300 people who have undergone DNA tests. Redheads like Braiker are more sensitive to hot and cold . And one 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed they need about 20 percent more anesthesia to knock them out for surgery. "I have had dental work and a graft done years ago on the roof of my mouth and it is still sensitive to temperature," he said. "I have also been a life-long wussy." Redheads are also better at making their own vitamin D, which helps protect against osteoporosis, because their bodies are more efficient at soaking up sunlight, according to Yahoo Health . Scottish researcher Jonathan Rees suggests the "ginger gene" may have helped protect redheads from rickets. According to an article in Huffington Post UK , redheads share some other interesting traits: their hair is harder to dye than other shades; they have fewer, but thicker strands of hair' and they go gray more slowly. But there are also health disadvantages. The color of human skin, hair and eyes is dictated by two types of melanin pigment that are produced in the upper layers of the skin: pheomelanin, which is reddish-yellow, and eumelanin, which is brownish-black.    A 2012 study from the journal Nature , found that the pigment pheomelanin, which gives hair the red color, makes redheads more susceptible to the melanoma than fair-skinned blonds, even when they cover up their skin. "What happens in the sun?" asked Braiker. "I stay out of it. The sun is not my friend. I get more freckles and I should wear a ridiculously high SPF on my face." Growing up had its challenges, he said, but eventually there were social advantages to being a redhead. "Over a lifetime, I have developed thick skin," said Braiker. "Growing up I was advanced a year in kindergarten or grade 1," he explained. "So I was a year younger with red hair and a little bit weaker than the rest. I was easy prey." He grew his hair long in college, even sporting a red afro, and continued to get cat calls from strangers: "What's up carrot top?" and "Ronald McDonald." But, he said, it made him tougher. "I always felt a little bit like a freak," said Braiker. "But over time, I learned to embrace the weirdness and it did help shape my personality. ... And there are definitely ladies who like redheads."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

That's what I have - it never occurred to me that it was rare until I saw it mentioned in an article.  Just curious how many others there are on the BHB.    From: www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emmakelly/...    4. Red hair and blue eyes is the rarest combination in the world  The majority of natural redheads have brown eyes, with others likely to have hazel or green shades.  But like red hair, blue eye colour is a recessive trait, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for a child to be blessed with it. This makes those with red hair and blue eyes the rarest minority in the world, with only 1% having both.  So, each one is about as rare as a four-leaf clover.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

By Susan Donaldson James  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Susan   March 17, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Courtesy of Brian Braiker Brian Braiker, a banjo player in the band, the "DeLorean Sisters," is often mistaken as Irish because of his red hair.  0 Shares               Email      Redheads, as they say, wear the map of Ireland all over their faces. Sorry, ginger-haired English Prince Harry. And the statistics bear that stereotype out. Ireland has the highest per capita percentage of redheads in the world -- anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, according to Eupedia , a website that explores European genetics and ancestry. They are almost equally prevalent in Scotland and other pockets of Celtic pride. A slightly lower percentage hail from Cornwall in England and western parts of Switzerland. Red hair is associated with the gene MC1R, a recessive and somewhat rare gene that occurs in only about 2 percent of the world's population, according to the National Institutes of Health . That means both parents must carry a copy of the gene to produce a red-haired child and often the trait skips generations. Rarest of all are redheads with blue eyes. The majority have brown eyes or hazel or green shades. Brian Braiker, executive editor of Digiday , who answered an ABCNews.com call for redheads with, "Better red than dead," said he is "always" mistaken for an Irishman. Ethnically, he is nearly all Ashkenazi Jew, except for a maternal grandmother who is Norwegian. Not surprising. Why do you think they called the plundering Scandinavian Erik the Red? Genetic genealogy has revealed a high percentage of people from southwest Norway coincide with a paternal lineage known as haplogroup Rib-L21, including its subclade, Rib-M222, which is typical of northern Ireland. Genealogists speculate that may be because the Vikings took Celtic slaves from Ireland to that part of Norway. Braiker, 6-foot, 3-inches tall, with his brown eyes and full-fledged auburn beard, said he didn't have an easy time of it growing up a redhead. His coloring was nothing like his dark-haired father and light-haired mother. "I endured jokes, 'Are you the milkman's son?' and 'Were you adopted,'" Braiker, 39, told ABCNews.com. The gene apparently skipped a generation or two, as he confides his father's grandfather and a maternal cousin also had red hair. One ancestry company, BritainsDNA , now offers parents the chance to see if they carry the recessive gene by sending in their saliva for testing. If both do, they have a one in four chance of conceiving a redhead. BritainsDNA conducted the biggest study of redhead genetics in the country, with more than 2,300 people who have undergone DNA tests. Redheads like Braiker are more sensitive to hot and cold . And one 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed they need about 20 percent more anesthesia to knock them out for surgery. "I have had dental work and a graft done years ago on the roof of my mouth and it is still sensitive to temperature," he said. "I have also been a life-long wussy." Redheads are also better at making their own vitamin D, which helps protect against osteoporosis, because their bodies are more efficient at soaking up sunlight, according to Yahoo Health . Scottish researcher Jonathan Rees suggests the "ginger gene" may have helped protect redheads from rickets. According to an article in Huffington Post UK , redheads share some other interesting traits: their hair is harder to dye than other shades; they have fewer, but thicker strands of hair' and they go gray more slowly. But there are also health disadvantages. The color of human skin, hair and eyes is dictated by two types of melanin pigment that are produced in the upper layers of the skin: pheomelanin, which is reddish-yellow, and eumelanin, which is brownish-black.    A 2012 study from the journal Nature , found that the pigment pheomelanin, which gives hair the red color, makes redheads more susceptible to the melanoma than fair-skinned blonds, even when they cover up their skin. "What happens in the sun?" asked Braiker. "I stay out of it. The sun is not my friend. I get more freckles and I should wear a ridiculously high SPF on my face." Growing up had its challenges, he said, but eventually there were social advantages to being a redhead. "Over a lifetime, I have developed thick skin," said Braiker. "Growing up I was advanced a year in kindergarten or grade 1," he explained. "So I was a year younger with red hair and a little bit weaker than the rest. I was easy prey." He grew his hair long in college, even sporting a red afro, and continued to get cat calls from strangers: "What's up carrot top?" and "Ronald McDonald." But, he said, it made him tougher. "I always felt a little bit like a freak," said Braiker. "But over time, I learned to embrace the weirdness and it did help shape my personality. ... And there are definitely ladies who like redheads."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

"Redhead" redirects here. For other uses, see Redhead (disambiguation) .     Woman with red hair       Man with red hair    Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1]  Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2]  Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered.  The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510.

Redheads today are commonly associated with the Celtic nations [4] and to a far lesser extent the Germanic peoples.  In Ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is estimated to be at around 10%, [5] making it the most red-haired country in the world. According to Britain's DNA, 34.7% of the Irish population carry the allele for red hair, although this doesn't directly translate proportionally into births of red-haired children. [6]  Scotland also has a very high percentage with around 6% of the population having red hair. [7] [8] Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA study used a sample of 2,343 people, and found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, with 35% overall carrying the allele and Edinburgh having the highest proportion at 40%. [7] [8] [9] The largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. [10]  England has a red hair prevalence of around 4%, with 28.5% of population having the allele; [7] while in Wales 38% of Welsh people carry the red-haired allele. [7] A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits from Great Britain found higher levels of red hair in Wales and the Scottish border counties of England . [fn 1] [11]  Eastern and Southern Europe     A Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale , c. 30 BC    Carleton Coon's 1939 book The Races of Europe stated that rufosity (reddish hair) often occurred in Montenegrins . [12] [13] [14]  In Italy , red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. [15] In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. [15]  Victorian era  ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga to be "the most red-headed men in the world", [16] a claim which has a solid basis even today, as the Volga region has more redheads per population than anywhere else in the world with the exception of Ireland . [17]  North Africa and Mediterranean      Hades abducting Persephone , fresco in the small royal tomb at Vergina , Macedonia, Greece , c. 340 BC    The Berber populations of Morocco [18] and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, [19] [20] [21] respectively. The Queen of Morocco , Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI , has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. [22] In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. [23] Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards . [24] In European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition , all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. [25] In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. [27] The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. [28]  Asia (all regions)     A Uyghur girl in Kashgar , China 's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair    In Asia, genetic red hair is rare, but reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair can be found in the Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine ), in Turkey , in Caucasia , in Northern Kazakhstan , among Uyghurs and among Indo-Iranians . [ editorializing ] The use of henna on hair and skin for various reasons occasionally occurs in Asia. When henna is used on hair it dyes the hair to different shades of red. [29] [30]  Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa  Emigration from Europe has multiplied the population of red haired humans in the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In the United States , it is estimated that 2–6% of the population has red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 420,000 in Ireland and 300,000 in Scotland. [7]  Historical     Woman with mixed reddish-brown hair, Papua New Guinea . Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair. [31]    Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. [32] The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red-haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. [33] [34]  In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians , who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China . Caucasian  Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC . [35]  Reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians , and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. [36] [37]  Biochemistry and genetics     A close-up view of red hair        Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum , made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii).    The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.  The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome  16 . Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer.  The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is unable to tan . Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not all-inclusive feature of red-haired people. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant [2] .  Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.  Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production. [38]  Genetics  The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His , and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. [39] The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA ) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. [40] [41]  In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.  Evolution  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. [42] In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift . [39]  Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. [43] [44]  A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans. [45]  Extinction hoax  See also: Disappearing blonde gene  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail , which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. [46] Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble , and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away". [47]  Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future. [47]  Medical implications of the red hair gene  Melanoma  Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning , but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage . Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. [48] It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. [49]  Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [50] [51]  Pain tolerance and injury  Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), [52] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. [53] [54] [55]  Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic . [56] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. [57] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide . [55]  The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins . (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC , and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. [58] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin , but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. [58] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.  There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. [59] [60] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising . [60]  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:   In cases of severe malnutrition , normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde . The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor , is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine .  One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea , results in red hair and red-colored skin. [61]  Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin . [61] [62]   Culture     Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum , late 1st-century BC to mid-1st century AD [63]       Polychrome Roman marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum    In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.      Portrait of a Lady , ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli        Elizabeth I of England , ca. 1588    Beliefs about temperament  A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables , a character says of Anne Shirley , the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye , Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair."  During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament . [64] In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda , redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.  Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels , "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms ," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that "neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo ] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe". [65] Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero . They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads. [66]  Media, fashion and art     "The Accolade" by Edmund Blair Leighton    Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman , Alyson Hannigan , Marcia Cross , Christina Hendricks , Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. [ citation needed ]  Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India , Iran , Bangladesh and Pakistan , henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance. [67]  Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color " Titian " takes its name from the artist Titian , who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli 's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites , Edmund Leighton , Modigliani , [68] and Gustav Klimt . [69]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes story " The Red-Headed League " (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor .  Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Red Sonja , Mystique , and Poison Ivy . [70]  Prejudice and discrimination against redheads  Medieval beliefs      Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral    Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers ( Der Eisenhans ) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper , in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk . [71]  Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum , [72] notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch , a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;   Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red.   Medieval antisemitism      Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd'    During the Spanish Inquisition , people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. [25] In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus , and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin . [27] The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. [28] The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David . The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau , even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'. [73]  Modern-day discrimination  "Carrot head" redirects here. For the French novel, see Poil de carotte .  In his 1885 book I Say No , Wilkie Collins wrote "The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair."  In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham , Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: "The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, "Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head," and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man." [74]  In British English , the word "ginger" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), [75] with terms such as "gingerphobia" [76] and "gingerism" [77] used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as "carrot tops" and "carrot heads". (The comedian " Carrot Top " uses this stage name .) "Gingerism" has been compared to racism , although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. [77]  Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for "being ginger". [78] In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; [79] in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne , was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair. [80] In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. [81] In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him "just because he had red hair". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. [82]  This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show . The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp , who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. [83] The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis ) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. [84] [85] ) Comedian Tim Minchin , himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song "Prejudice". [86]  The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the " Ginger Kids ", " Le Petit Tourette ", " It's a Jersey Thing " and " Fatbeard " episodes of South Park .  Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. [87] However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; "Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd," says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons . [88]  In Australian slang , redheads are often nicknamed "Blue" or "Bluey". [89] More recently, they have been referred to as "rangas" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. [90] The word "rufus" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; [91] based on a variant of rufous , a reddish-brown color.  In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a "National Kick a Ginger Day" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. [92]  In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words: " Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones " after customers complained the card was offensive. [93]  In October 2010, Harriet Harman , the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a "ginger rodent". [94] Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was "proud to be ginger". [95] Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. [96]  In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks , announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination . [97]  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo ( Chinese : 红毛 ; pinyin : hóng máo ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : âng-mo͘ ) in Hokkien ( Min Nan ) Chinese means "red-haired", [98] and is used in Malaysia and Singapore to refer to white people. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui ( 红毛鬼 ) meaning "red-haired devil", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo ("foreign devil"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. [99] Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. [100] Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times , [101] and in television programmes and films.  The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō ( 紅毛 ), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku , its 200-year period of isolation. [102]  Red hair festivals     Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day , September 2007    There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival is paid for by the local government in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands. [103] It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. Today, the festival includes music, fashion shows, art exhibitions and a picnic [104]  The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. [105]  A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. [106]  Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot) , held for the local Israeli red hair community, [107] including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. [108] However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. [109] The organizers state; "The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.” [109]  The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. [110]  Religious and mythological traditions  In the Iliad , Achilles ' hair is described as ξανθῆς [111] ( ksanthēs ) , usually translated as blonde, or golden [112] but sometimes as red or tawny. [113] [114] His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. [115]  The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. [116]     Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys    The Hebrew word usually translated "ruddy" or "reddish-brown" ( admoni  אדמוני , from the root ADM אדם , see also Adam and Edom ) [117] [118] [119] [120] was used to describe both Esau and David .  Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.  Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture [121] [122] and in the works of William Shakespeare , [123] reinforcing the negative stereotype.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive . Read More: 4 Ways Medical Conditions Can Change Your Hairstyle More Likely to To Be Left-Handed There is limited scientific research regarding being a redhead and a "lefty," but it seems to be common. Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

That's what I have - it never occurred to me that it was rare until I saw it mentioned in an article.  Just curious how many others there are on the BHB.    From: www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emmakelly/...    4. Red hair and blue eyes is the rarest combination in the world  The majority of natural redheads have brown eyes, with others likely to have hazel or green shades.  But like red hair, blue eye colour is a recessive trait, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for a child to be blessed with it. This makes those with red hair and blue eyes the rarest minority in the world, with only 1% having both.  So, each one is about as rare as a four-leaf clover.

TamokoJapan    Last edited 06/13/2015      Just curious for those of you with half Japanese and half Caucasian children, what hair color and what eye colors do your children have? Do your children look like each other? And what hair/eye color does the Caucasian parent have? We're having a half-European girl in August and I'm so curious as to what she might potentially look like! I'm European mixed with medium/dark brown hair and blue eyes (DH is Japanese).  I'm guessing the chance of blue eyes is very, very low, so either green or brown would be most likely. We are all different, but I'm still curious!

I'm curious what this next one will look like!               Reply            Report this comment        4                     Jpnmum    Posted 06/13/2015     I'm blue eyed/dark blond. Our eldest has hazel eyes (were grey as a baby) and dark brown hair. Youngest has brown eyes basically from the start. Not enough hair to tell yet, haha.  Also only our second son got the Mongolian blue spot/birth mark!               Reply            Report this comment        2                     bubsdubs    Posted 06/13/2015      I'm half Japanese!

Dh is black hair, dark brown eyes and medium-fair complexion (I'd call it a golden) with some Caucasian ancestry that includes red hair and green eyes.  Our baby turned out blue eyed, my brown hair but with red lights in it, and even fairer complexion than I have. I think it depends really on if the Japanese parent has any Caucasian ancestry but he and his parents were really surprised lol    --  Annabelle Rose 02/13/15              Reply            Report this comment       0                     TamokoJapan · Original Poster    Last edited 06/14/2015     Awesome, thanks for the replies! My cousin (Caucasian) had a baby with his Japanese wife and the baby has blue eyes, but I know that baby's eyecolor changes a lot and doesn't "settle" for like 9 months? And since Asian genes/brown eyes are very dominant, I assume most blue eyes don't actually stay blue for babies who are 50% ore more Japanese.  I also read the blue Mongolian spots are very usual for hafus. I'm actually worried, because my side of the family is white and most of them probably don't even know what it is... If she gets it, I'll have to always make sure to explain it's a birth mark and not child abuse. :/               Reply            Report this comment       0                     bubsdubs    Posted 06/14/2015       TamokoJapan said:    Awesome, thanks for the replies!

Also Mongolian spot is actually not just an asain trait and most Drs outside of Japan will know what it is. None of my kids had it, but my nephew (1/4 Japanese) did!

Unless your DH  (dear husband) has submissive genes that aren't showing up (ie mixed heritage himself) there is no chance of having a blonde blue eyed haafu unless its a mutation. I'm half Asian myself and my girls have blue eyes and medium brown hair because I have those recessive genes.

But they all turn dark-green or brown, depending on the genes. Brown eyes are so dominating, especially with Asian genes.  Everyone in my family have blue eyes, but my grandmother has brown and I think that's how I ended up with one blue and one green.

04/22/2014  Yes, DH is very much a redhead. Or at least was. He's turning blonde now he's getting old. Gingers apparently turn blonde rather than white haired when they age.      Lol! He probably got the hair from Dh then. I'd say chances aren't that slim after all, which isn't a bad thing, bean is absolutely gorgeous. But then again I'm no expert. I'm just going off of what I've researched. Before LO  (little one) was born I was dead set that he'd be a redhead since it runs heavy in my family. So I looked up the odds all I got was what I already said about the recessive gene.

No one in my family has red hair. They are all Italian and dark hair or blonde hair. My husbands dads uncle is the only one that had red hair. Everyone else had brown or blonde. None of the other grandkids have red hair except one. It ran on her moms side of the family though. So I figured that's where she got her red hair. Just didn't know what the chances are. Especially since it doesn't run in my family. My two boys have light brown and dark brown hair. Just curious as to what you think??

My Mom has red hair and my brothers all have red hair.  (BRIGHT RED)  I have blonde hair like my father.  My older brother has 3 children- all have brown to dark brown hair.  Other brother has 2 kids- both blonde.  *Of course you know- I have 2- Blonde and a light brown almost blonde.  So i'm wondering if maybe #3 will be red?!    --  Ashley BrownHausKids Blog Krayden Liam 9-28-09 Maddox Kure 12-27-10 Raleigh Martin 8-1-13 Sawyer Roux 12-5-14             Reply            Report this comment       0                      SamiCrow    Posted 05/30/2013      I'm going with slim to none too.

Of course, I thought my kids would all have brown hair and brown eyes like me and my entire family.  One girl does.  The other has straw blonde hair and bright blue eyes.  Genetics is a weird thing.  I do keep joking that this one will have red hair just because the other two look nothing alike but it actually is possible in our case.  My DH's grandfather had bright red hair and my grandmother had auburn.  We'll know on Monday!    --  May 2006 , April 2009 , June 2013             Reply            Report this comment       0                     ashley&chuck; · Original Poster    Posted 05/30/2013      SamiCrow I DON'T want a red head that's why I am asking this question.

My nephew has red hair (but he has very little hair!). Both my daughter and my niece have blonde hair.  I would say it's very recessive, but it could pop up along the line!

Hubby had blonde hair when he was little so that part makes sense, but for a while everyone teased that he wasnt ours. :) Im really excited to see what color hair this one will have!    --  Wife to an amazing husband and father since 6/26/2010 Baby boy born 2/20/2012 Baby girl born 6/11/2013             Reply            Report this comment       0               / 5      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

JDMcM    Posted 12/22/2011      I realize eye and hair color can change over time but I am feeling a little uncomfortable that my daughter was born with red hair and blue eyes. My husband has very dark and dominant genes and so far, she looks nothing like him. She looks only a little bit like me but only because of her fair skin. My hair is brown/blond and eyes are hazel. My first was born with brown eyes and dark hair. Because this baby was not, people keep jokingly questioning whether or not my husband is the father. He always said that if we had a non-brown eyed baby, he might be concerned.  Anyone else have children with features drastically different? I keep wondering what the chances/odds are she'll end up looking a little more like him.     --  Mother to beautiful baby girl, Deviney. 10.10.09             Comment            Report this post       0          Comments (24)        / 3                   cmac609    Posted 12/22/2011      Most babies are born with blue eyes.

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I have red hair and blue eyes, both of my parents have blue eyes but light brown hair, My husband had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes, his parents both have dark brown hair and his mom has blue eyes and his dad has brown...my question is, if we have a child what are its chances of having blue eyes or red hair?        -A curious adult from Ohio   February 16, 2006  The chances for green or blue eyes are around 50% ( click here for the details). The chances for red hair depend entirely on whether or not your husband carries a hidden red hair gene. If he does, then there is most likely a 50-50 shot for a redhead. If he doesn't, then the chances are close to zero ( click here for more details).  So, if your husband is a carrier for red hair, then your chances for a redhead with blue or green eyes is 1 in 4 (we separate out the two below). If he isn't a carrier, then chances are pretty close to zero for a blue-eyed child with red hair. Let's see where I got those numbers.   Eye color : As I said earlier, your chances for a child with blue or green eyes are around 50%. These chances are based on an eye color model where two genes determine eye color.  The first gene is the brown-blue gene, bey2. It comes in two forms, a brown (B) and a blue one (b). Brown is dominant over blue which means if either or both of your copies of this gene are B, then you have brown eyes (remember, we have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad).  OK, so we know you are for sure bb (both copies are blue); that is the only way to get blue eyes. And we know your husband has at least one B since he has brown eyes.  But what about the other copy of his brown-blue gene? It is often hard to figure out if someone is a blue eye carrier. However, because his mom has blue eyes, we know he got a b from her. In other words, he is Bb -- a brown-eyed carrier of blue eyes.  So what does this mean for your children? It means that you will always pass a blue eye version (b) and that your husband will pass one onto his kids half the time. Your kids have a 50-50 shot of not having brown eyes.  We can't rule out that they'll have green eyes, though. This is because there is a 2nd gene, a green-blue gene (gey) that is involved as well. It comes in two forms, a green (G) and a blue (b) one.  One more thing, the brown version of bey2 is dominant over the green version of gey, which is dominant over the blue versions of both genes. In other words, brown trumps green and blue, and green trumps blue.  We don't know your husband's green gene status because we don't know his dad's green gene status (we know yours because you have blue eyes). Because his mom had blue eyes, we know she is bb for the green-blue gene. Which means your husband has at least one b.  If your husband is Gb, then each child has a 1 in 4 chance for blue eyes, a 1 in 4 chance for green, and a 1 in 2 chance for brown. If he is bb for the green-blue gene, then your kids have a 50-50 shot at blue and a 50-50 shot at brown eyes. Our answer here hopefully makes this all more clear.  Your two possible eye color scenarios:  1) Your husband is a carrier for green eyes (BbGb)    2) Your husband is not a carrier for green eyes (Bbbb)     A word of warning. As complicated as this is, it doesn't explain everything about eye color. There are cases where blue-eyed parents have green or brown-eyed kids even though this is impossible by this model.  These sorts of things happen often enough that it probably isn't due just to new mutations in their eye color genes. There are probably genes we just don't know about that are involved in eye color. Click here to learn about how these might work.   Red hair : Red hair is often a very simple dominant/recessive case. What I mean is that a certain gene called MC1R comes in two forms, a nonred (R) and a red (r) form. R is dominant over r.  As a redhead, you are rr, you will always pass a red hair gene down to your kids. But what about your husband? He could be either an RR or an Rr, it is impossible to know right now.  Well, that isn't strictly true. If he could have one gene, MC1R, sequenced, he would have a pretty good idea about whether or not he is a carrier. Unfortunately, no one is currently offering this service*. Some, but not all carriers of the red hair gene have freckles so this can be a hint. But there are people without freckles who carry a red hair gene too (me, for example).  So, let's say your husband is a carrier. Then we are in a similar position to blue eyes. You will always pass on an r version of the MC1R gene. All of your kids will at least be carriers.  Your husband has a 50-50 shot of passing on the red hair version, r. Those kids that get the r from your husband will be redheads. Those who get the R will be carriers.  If your husband is RR, then most likely none of your kids will end up redheads. They will all be carriers of the red hair gene (from you) but not redheads themselves.  OK, so let's put it all together:  Husband genotype  Chance for Red hair/Blue eyes   Bb Gb Rr  1 in 8 (12.5%)   Bb bb Rr  1 in 4 (25%)   Bb Gb RR  Little or none   Bb bb RR  Little or none  Now again, none of this is as simple as I've stated so far. There are some people with red hair whose MC1R gene has no DNA changes. So there are other genes that can cause red hair as well. And there are some DNA changes in only one copy of MC1R that appear to cause red hair even when the other copy has no changes.  However, from the work done thus far, the idea that you end up with red hair when both copies of your MC1R gene are mutated explains around 2/3 of red hair. Pretty good by genetic standards!

Your life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits!     All eyes are beautiful eyes , but if you're part of the majority of people who have brown eyes, you've probably dreamed of something more exotic. Maybe dark hair and gray eyes was the rare hair and eye color combination you wished for, and while that's a match we'd have to agree is pretty stunning, the title of rarest hair and eye color combination belongs to another group.  According to Medical Daily , blue-eyed redheads take the prize for rarest hair and eye color combination. Both genes for blue eyes and red hair are recessive, so if you can remember back to high school biology and Punnett Squares , you'll know just how rare this combo is.  So, how common is the red hair and blue eyes combo? Only two percent of the world population — about 140 million in 7.6 billion — has red hair. Blue eyes, on the other hand, are a lot more common: About 17 percent of the world population has blue eyes. Ignoring genetic factors that make people of a certain race more likely than others to have this hair and eye color combination, you're looking at 12.75 million people on this planet with red hair and blue eyes.  If that number is hard to imagine, just remember that you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime (0.03 percent) than of meeting a redhead with blue eyes (0.017 percent).  Who knew? And while you rack your brains trying to think of redheads with blue eyes that you know, we'll go ahead and tell you that many of your favorite celebrities with red hair aren't natural redheads!

Bees are, apparently, more attracted to people with red hair , and a 2017 study found natural redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. That said, it's not all bad news. A German researcher named Werner Habermehl found redheads have more sex than their blonde and brunette counterparts.  h/t Reader's Digest  Get fuller-looking hair with eyeshadow!

By: Rosemary O. Fernandez Around this time last year, I got the best news of my life: My husband and I were expecting a baby! We kept it to ourselves for a while, but soon told our family and friends. As I inevitably expanded, I was asked the inevitable question: Will the little one have red hair too? This was a perfectly reasonable question as I was born with screaming red hair –the kind of shade that has prompted numerous strangers to tell me I have the map of Ireland written on my face despite the fact that I’m mostly Italian. I inherited these locks from my (Italian) mother, and my husband’s mother and grandfather are also gingers. Needless to say, the odds were in the little guy’s favor. Thirty-eight weeks slugged by, and I’d estimate that I heard the question about three times a week. Coworkers joked about it. Family members hoped for it. Random people at the grocery store thought it would be terrific. Naturally all my husband and I prayed for was a healthy child. Whether he popped out with red, blonde, brown, or green hair, we’d cuddle and dote on him just the same. But I’d be lying if I said I never crossed my fingers and daydreamed about strolling down the street with a fiery-headed toddler in tow. Here are some facts to see if  you will have a redhead baby: 1. In order for a baby to have red hair, both parents have to carry the gene, since it’s a recessive trait. So if you’re a ginger and you marry a ginger, odds are, your kids will be gingers, too. If only one parent has the locks but the other is a carrier, the baby’s chances are 50/50. If neither of you are red but you both are carriers, you have a one in four chance of a fiery-haired child. And, sorry to say, if only one parent is not a carrier (even though the other is), you’ve got no shot. [ Source ] 2. Even though you might not be a redhead yourself, studies estimate that 25 percent of Caucasian Americans carry the ginger gene, so if you fall into this category you might end up with a redheaded baby when you’re least expecting it. [ Source ] READ: 10 Things To Know If You’re a Redhead Baby My reasons weren’t purely aesthetic, because for me, my hair color is a huge part of my personality. I’m confident. I’m intelligent. I’m friendly. I’m funny (though my husband says it’s usually when I don’t mean to be). Growing up, my hair helped me cultivate these qualities. I’m used to strangers addressing me simply because they want to pay me a compliment about my hair; therefore I have no problem doing the same to someone else when I like their outfit or a speech they presented. On the first day of school when teachers called my name, they also told me they liked my hair; hence I became comfortable in a classroom from an early age, absorbed more information, and was never too timid to raise my hand when I knew the answer. I’m often the only redheaded in my group of friends, so I developed a good sense of direction; since I’m the most easily spotted in a crowd, my pals often followed me when we were out. Here are some other fun facts about redheads in general: Enjoy those baby blues while they last. The world’s rarest hair and eye color combo is red hair and blue eyes. [ Source ]  number 4 on list ] Redheads are more likely to be left-handed. [ Source ] Redheaded babies are the cutest babies. Ok, this one’s just my opinion. READ: Facts About Redheads That May Surprise You I want all this and more for my child. More than I want to dress him in t-shirts that have fun redheaded slogans, I want him to be confident. I want him to know he’s smart. I want him to not be afraid to be kind. Though hair color doesn’t determine these qualities, I know from experience that it helps. Sixteen weeks after birth, what’s the verdict? The jury’s still out. The baby was born with dark hair. Those strands have now mostly fallen out, and it looks like some red is replacing it. Only time will tell. But I still have my fingers crossed. Rock it like a Redhead!

Ella Pazare  4 months ago  Reply    Ohh I have red hair and green eyes❤💚               Sandra Freed  4 months ago  Reply    I have red hair, and this article has both right and wrong information (at least the wrong things are not true for me).  The real reason Blue is rare with redheads is because it is a rare color in general, and when combined with the rarity of red hair, it is one of the least common combinations.  Even if the second “fact” is true, don’t just call us mutants, we get offended.  The one about redheads being left handed is FALSE, your strong hand is the hand you learned to use most, I’m right handed, and in fact lost my left hand.  I am more sensitive to the cold than my sister, who is blonde.  This might not be true for all reds, but I do consider myself to be a hot-head.  About being easy to find, it all depends on the size of the crowd and ratio of redheads to others.  AND WHO THE HECK THOUGHT WE WERE VAMPIRES?!

For people who cant stand it if someone calls you ginger, i have a tip: make a contest about who had the most original joke about redheads. It is just very funny what you here sometimes. There is this bully who is on the top of the list without knowing it. Its just funny, try it out. Also, am i the only one who sweats and gets a red face although i am not embarresed at all? Btw, good facts               Robert Rudd  2 months ago  Reply    Hey there, I am a redhead with green eyes and I feel shut out of the world due to my gingerness and always have. It’s nice to see that people like me care and respect being unique. I mean really why is it that when I date a red haired girl everyone assumes she is my sister, it’s wrong and I want to stop this bias behavior the world has toward us. Thank you.               Abi McCartney  1 month ago  Reply    Wow, what a great article. I have long ginger hair, freckles, blue eyes and I’m left handed. I have very sensitive skin and teeth! My sense of humour and the amount that I laugh is often commented on. I love being around people and embrace the light hearted ridicule that I receive on a daily basis for being so different. I’m not hot headed, more laid back if anything. However I’m very passionate, loving and caring. I was very fourtunate not to be picked on at school, I guess I was a cool kid and got on with everyone (I’m 30 by the way). I wouldn’t suggest I am proud to be a red head, just grateful to be loved for being me.               Malachai Smith  4 weeks ago  Reply    I’m a redheaded teen guy and I am not just a red-head ginger. I am on the full-on-fire-headed level and I have often been made fun of for it. To find that I am not the only one and that we can actually be appreciated is a huge blessing. Too often, I have been mocked and insulted in my hallways at school. So, to know that they are being stupid is awesome. My heart and my soul are so happy to find this community of red-heads.              24 Sensitivity to Hot and Cold   According to some studies, a side effect for redheads is that they are more sensitive to hot and cold pain than any other hair color.  23 Ginger King and Queen in Netherlands   Each September, the Netherlands holds a two-day celebration out of appreciation for redheads around the world which is called Roodharigendag in Dutch. The party includes crowning the ginger King and Queen.  22 Types of Redheads   There is a variety of red hair than you think. Red hair comes in so many different colors (Burnt Orange, Copper, Blonde, Ginger), sizes (Short and long) and shapes as other hair colors.  21 Behavior with Redheads in Past   They have been treated awfully in the past. Hitler was against the intermarriage of redheads believing that they produce more devil children.  20 Bee's attraction Towards Redheads   According to some studies bees are more attracted to redheads than any other hair color, probably it’s because they seem like sweet red flowers because of their red crown of hair.  19 Redheads are Hot-headed   Redheads are also known as hot-headed. However, there is no confirmation of this being valid. It might be just because of their red hair color they are called hot headed in a sense of joke.  18 Disney Princesses with Redhead   We also have redhead Disney Princesses like Merida and Ariel. It means that red hair color is too cool because, Ariel and Merida also want to be a part of the ginger world, but you cannot have them because they are too beautiful for this earth.  17 Easy to Found   Redheads never get lost in the crowd because of their red crown of hair which makes them unique from others which are cool.  16 Hardest Shade to Dye   According to a study, it is proved that Red is the hardest shade to dye your hair and also difficult to maintain it. So to be a redhead is a benefit.  15 Sense of Humor   Redheads have an impressive sense of humor because they grow up by teased for their ginger hair color.  14 Lower Rate of Prostate Cancer   To be a redhead is beneficial for men because according to some studies red headed men are 54 percent less likely to create prostate cancer. It means a lot for ginger men.  13 Redheads are Vampires   According to early Greeks believes Redheads were Vampires , and they also turn into vampires after they have died.  12 Less Hair Strands   Redheads have fewer hair than brunettes or blondes. According to research on an average, brunettes have 140,000 strands of hair; blondes have 110,000 strands of hair and redheads have 90,000 which is too less, but red hair is thicker than any other hair color.  11 Larger Dose of Anesthesia   In surgeries, it's been recommended that a few redheads require 20 percent larger doses of anesthesia as compared to a regular patient. Research proved this that redhead needs more anesthesia than people having other hair colors.  10 Absorption and Making of Vitamin D   They are more efficient at making Vitamin D . Redheads have the low amount of eumelanin in their body that is why they cannot absorb the required level of Vitamin D. In any case, they compensate for this by creating their particular Vitamin D when they are present in low-light condition.  So, they do not need as much sunlight to get what they need.  9 Concept of Christmas Communities   Christian communities considered a mark of the devil were birthmarks, patches and the major one was red hair. Many Christian communities believed that Judas was a redheaded textual proof from the Bible.  This belief really inspired some painters to paint Judas with red hair.  8 Aristotle Theory   Aristotle had some issues with redheads. Aristotle himself reported for the once saying "The reddish are of bad character" which shows that he hates redheads.  7 Resistant to Pain Blocker   Redheads are more resistant to pain blocker. Redhead gene releases a chemical called pheomelanin, which is the cause of blocks the brain’s receptivity/acceptance to pain.  6 Redheads are Genetic   Families can carry redhead gene for generations without knowing it. So, it is might possible that there could be some redhead gene inside you that can surprise you for being a redhead’s parent.  5 Temperature Sensors   Redheads are good at detecting changes in temperature than a person having any other hair color so, we can call them Temperature sensor.  4 Extinction of Redhead   According to research found by Britain DNA has found that more than 40 percent of the population carries the MC1R gene that is responsible for red hair . Redheads are not going to extinct because families have MC1R gene without knowing it.  3 Sensitive Teeth   According to some studies, redheads have more sensitive teeth.

By Susan Donaldson James  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Susan   March 17, 2014   0 Shares               Email      Star     Courtesy of Brian Braiker Brian Braiker, a banjo player in the band, the "DeLorean Sisters," is often mistaken as Irish because of his red hair.  0 Shares               Email      Redheads, as they say, wear the map of Ireland all over their faces. Sorry, ginger-haired English Prince Harry. And the statistics bear that stereotype out. Ireland has the highest per capita percentage of redheads in the world -- anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, according to Eupedia , a website that explores European genetics and ancestry. They are almost equally prevalent in Scotland and other pockets of Celtic pride. A slightly lower percentage hail from Cornwall in England and western parts of Switzerland. Red hair is associated with the gene MC1R, a recessive and somewhat rare gene that occurs in only about 2 percent of the world's population, according to the National Institutes of Health . That means both parents must carry a copy of the gene to produce a red-haired child and often the trait skips generations. Rarest of all are redheads with blue eyes. The majority have brown eyes or hazel or green shades. Brian Braiker, executive editor of Digiday , who answered an ABCNews.com call for redheads with, "Better red than dead," said he is "always" mistaken for an Irishman. Ethnically, he is nearly all Ashkenazi Jew, except for a maternal grandmother who is Norwegian. Not surprising. Why do you think they called the plundering Scandinavian Erik the Red? Genetic genealogy has revealed a high percentage of people from southwest Norway coincide with a paternal lineage known as haplogroup Rib-L21, including its subclade, Rib-M222, which is typical of northern Ireland. Genealogists speculate that may be because the Vikings took Celtic slaves from Ireland to that part of Norway. Braiker, 6-foot, 3-inches tall, with his brown eyes and full-fledged auburn beard, said he didn't have an easy time of it growing up a redhead. His coloring was nothing like his dark-haired father and light-haired mother. "I endured jokes, 'Are you the milkman's son?' and 'Were you adopted,'" Braiker, 39, told ABCNews.com. The gene apparently skipped a generation or two, as he confides his father's grandfather and a maternal cousin also had red hair. One ancestry company, BritainsDNA , now offers parents the chance to see if they carry the recessive gene by sending in their saliva for testing. If both do, they have a one in four chance of conceiving a redhead. BritainsDNA conducted the biggest study of redhead genetics in the country, with more than 2,300 people who have undergone DNA tests. Redheads like Braiker are more sensitive to hot and cold . And one 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed they need about 20 percent more anesthesia to knock them out for surgery. "I have had dental work and a graft done years ago on the roof of my mouth and it is still sensitive to temperature," he said. "I have also been a life-long wussy." Redheads are also better at making their own vitamin D, which helps protect against osteoporosis, because their bodies are more efficient at soaking up sunlight, according to Yahoo Health . Scottish researcher Jonathan Rees suggests the "ginger gene" may have helped protect redheads from rickets. According to an article in Huffington Post UK , redheads share some other interesting traits: their hair is harder to dye than other shades; they have fewer, but thicker strands of hair' and they go gray more slowly. But there are also health disadvantages. The color of human skin, hair and eyes is dictated by two types of melanin pigment that are produced in the upper layers of the skin: pheomelanin, which is reddish-yellow, and eumelanin, which is brownish-black.    A 2012 study from the journal Nature , found that the pigment pheomelanin, which gives hair the red color, makes redheads more susceptible to the melanoma than fair-skinned blonds, even when they cover up their skin. "What happens in the sun?" asked Braiker. "I stay out of it. The sun is not my friend. I get more freckles and I should wear a ridiculously high SPF on my face." Growing up had its challenges, he said, but eventually there were social advantages to being a redhead. "Over a lifetime, I have developed thick skin," said Braiker. "Growing up I was advanced a year in kindergarten or grade 1," he explained. "So I was a year younger with red hair and a little bit weaker than the rest. I was easy prey." He grew his hair long in college, even sporting a red afro, and continued to get cat calls from strangers: "What's up carrot top?" and "Ronald McDonald." But, he said, it made him tougher. "I always felt a little bit like a freak," said Braiker. "But over time, I learned to embrace the weirdness and it did help shape my personality. ... And there are definitely ladies who like redheads."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.
