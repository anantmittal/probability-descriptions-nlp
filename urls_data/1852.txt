Is it even possible?  Kevin   This is a typical question one might encounter in an introductory statistics class. Because the sum of a large number of random variables always will approach a bell curve we can use the central limit theorem to get at the answer. From my section on the house edge we find the standard deviation in blackjack to be 1.17. You won't understand this if you haven't studied statistics, but the probability of being at a loss in your example will be the Z statistic of 45000*0.005/(45000 1/2 *1.17) =~ 0.91. Any basic statistics book should have a standard normal table which will give the Z statistic of 0.8186. So the probability of being ahead in your example is about 18%.     I have a few questions regarding blackjack: How often can one expect the dealer to bust and how often can a player expect to win four hands in a row?  John from Westminster, USA   When the dealer stands on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.1% of the time. When the dealer hits on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.6% of the time.  According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of a net win is 42.42%.  However, if we skip ties, the probability is 46.36%.  So, the probability of a four wins in a row is 0.4636 4 = 4.62%.     First of all, I would like to add my name to the growing list of people who love your web site. Your information is quite valuable to both the beginning and expert gambler, and you present your findings in a pleasant, understandable, and even humorous manner. I always check out your site before I head to Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe just to remind me how to play smartly. Anyway, on to my question. Well, more of an observation: when the dealer pulls a 5 on a 16 for their sixth consecutive win, there's always someone who gets up and leaves the table, muttering that the dealer is a mean cruel heartless soul, and goes in search of a "hotter" table. But is there any truth in this? Obviously the dealer is inconsequential to the cards dealt (I like to say the dealer is "simply a messenger of the cards") but are streaks in an 8-deck shoe inevitable, and even predictable? Or is it more like your roulette example, where the odds of each new round are exactly the same? Thanks once again for your web site.  Dave K. from Beverly Hills, California   Thanks for your kind words. Streaks, such as the dealer drawing a 5 to a 16, are inevitable but not predictable. Blackjack is not entirely a game of independent trials like roulette, but the deck is not predisposed to run in streaks. For the non-card counter it may be assumed that the odds are the same in each new round. Putting aside some minor effects of deck composition, the dealer who pulled a 5 to a 16 the last five times in a row would be just as likely to do it the next time as the dealer who had been busting on 16 for several hours.     What are the odds against winning seven hands of blackjack in a row? How about six?  James from Palo Alto, California   According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of an overall win in blackjack is 42.22%, a tie is 8.48%, and a loss is 49.10%. I'm going to assume you wish to ignore ties for purposes of the streak.  In that case, the probability of a win, given a resolved bet, is 46.36%.  The probability of winning n hands is a row is 0.4636 n . So the probability of winning six in a row is 0.99% and seven in a row is 0.46%.     Can it actually be true that what I experience has a statistical base? It seems to me that it takes a lot longer to win X number of chips that to lose the same amount (I only play blackjack). For example, if I start with 300 chips, it might take hours to double my money (my goal), yet I can lost that number in what seems like almost no time at all. Can this really be true? Also, do you have a rule of thumb about when to leave the table when you are winning?  Chris from Gaithersburg, Maryland   What you have experienced is likely the result of some very bad losing streaks. It may also be the result of progressive betting or mistakes in strategy. The basic strategy flat bettor should have a roughly symmetrical expectation in terms of steep ups and downs, slightly favoring steep downs due to the house edge and a 48% chance of a losing hand compared to 43% chance of winning.  If I'm playing for fun then I leave the table when I'm not having fun any longer.     In a six-deck shoe, what is the percentage of times that a blackjack (ace face card or ten) will come up?  Ed from Lynnwood, USA   Let n be the number of decks. The probability of a blackjack is 2*(4/13)*(4n/(52*n-1)). If n=6 the probability is 192/4043 = 4.75%.     Still love your site! I always turn to your site when I'm having questions, most of the time I will find the answer but not always. When playing basic strategy blackjack I understand that I will have ups and downs and over the long run I will roughly break even, my question is what is really "over the long run"? A month, a year, five years? Any ideas?  Kim from Helsinki, Finland   Thanks for the kind words. You ask a good question for which there is no firm answer. It is more a matter of degree, the more you play the more your results will approach the house edge. I recently replaced my blackjack appendix 4 with some information about the standard deviation which may help. For example this table shows that if you play 10,000 hands of blackjack the probability is 90% of finishing within 192 units where you started after subtracting the expected loss due to the house edge. So in 10,000 hands you are likely to win or lose less than 2% of total money bet due to random variation. However if we go up to one million hands the probability is 90% of an 0.2% variation due to luck. In general the variation in the mean is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of hands you play. All of this assumes flat betting, otherwise the math really gets messy.     Please explain how to calculate the probability of a blackjack occurring in a single deck. I can easily work other hands but when a card can be either/or my brain cramps.  Mike from Bossier City, USA   The probability that the first card is an ace is 4/52. The probability that the second card is a 10 point card is 16/51. So the probability of an ace first blackjack is (4/52)*(16/51). Multiply this by 2 because the ten could just as easily be the first card and the answer is 2*(4/52)*(16/51) = 128/2652 = 0.0482655, or about 1 in 20.7 .     Do you have any idea what the "record" is for the most sevens thrown with a pair of fair dice in craps is? I had someone tell me it was 84, but the odds against that many sevens in a row being thrown is so long I'm  skeptical. It seems it's more possible that 84 consecutive passes have come out, but even that's a million to one shot (figuratively--literally, it's much worse). I tried to look on the Web but have no idea where I would find something like that.  Mike   Since this question was submitted, a player held the dice for 154 rolls on May 23, 2009 in Atlantic City.  The probability of this is 1 in  5,590,264,072.  For the probability for any number of throws from 1 to 200, please see my craps survival tables .  For how to solve the problem yourself, see my MathProblems.info site, problem 204.     If I play 100 hands of blackjack at $5 a hand at an 0.5% house edge how much can I lose and still be above three standard deviations south of expectation?  Blair from Christchurch, New Zealand   Your expected loss would be 100*$5*.005=$2.50. The standard deviation of one hand is 1.17, which can be found in my blackjack appendix 7 . So, one standard deviation in your example is $5*1.17*sqr(100)=$58.5. So, the probability of losing $295 or more due to bad luck is .00135 (the Z statistic for -3).     If the first card dealt is an ace what is the probability the dealer will have a blackjack? Assume two decks.  T from Las Vegas, U.S.   There are 103 cards remaining in the two decks and 32 are tens. So the probability of a blackjack is 32/103=31.07%.     What percentage of hands are suited blackjacks? Six-deck shoe, any suit.  RWR from Tuscon, USA   The probability of a suited blackjack in a six-deck game is 2*(4/13)*(6/311) = 0.0118723.     For blackjack, which is the probability to obtain three suited seven in a 6-deck shoe?  Rodrigo from Costa Rica   I attempt to work this out in my blackjack appendix 8 but I’ll work through it more slowly here. We’ll ignore dealer blackjacks to keep things simple and assume the player always hits after two cards. The number of ways to arrange 3 cards in a 6-deck shoe is combin(312,3)=5,013,320. There are 24 sevens in the shoe. The number of ways to arrange 3 sevens out of 24 is combin(24,3)=2024. The probability is the number of winning combinations divided by total combinations, or 2024/5013320=0.0004, or about 1 in 2477.     What piece of information am I missing? If the odds of pulling a ten count card out of a deck is about 30.7% and the odds of pulling out an ace is 7.8% then it seems to me that the combined odds of this happening are about 2.4%. Why do blackjack simulators and blackjack authors state that the odds for a blackjack are 4.7% which happens to twice the calculated odds. What am I missing?  Jeffrey from Loveland   You are forgetting that there are two possible orders, either the ace or the ten can be first. Multiply by 2 and you’ll have your answer.     You go, wiz. Our local casino hands out promotional coupons, which act as a first-card ace in blackjack. From your BJ appendix, most hands containing an ace have a positive expectation, without counting the BJs you’ll get four out of every thirteen plays. Do you know the overall expectation of having an ace as your first card? Thanks.  Victor from Yakima, Washington   According to Stanford Wong’s ’Basic Blackjack’ he says the player’s edge given the first card is an ace is 50.5% (page 124). Your question however could be rephrased as, "what is the value of the ace, given that the other card is not a ten." Using an infinite deck for the sake of simplicity we can breakdown Wong’s number as follows: 0.505 = (4/13)*1.5 + (9/13)*x, where x is what you want to know. Doing some simple algebra we get x=28.5%.     I have just read an article that says it’s proper basic strategy to stand on a multiple card 16, containing a 4 or 5, Vs. a dealer’s 10 in a multiple deck (4 or more decks) blackjack game. I checked your web site and I could only find appendixes for multiple card hands in 1 and 2 deck games. Is this article correct?  Rodney from Clarence, New York   Yes! Good question, even I didn’t know this. The fewer the decks and the greater the number of cards the more this is true. To test the most likely case to favor hitting, 8 decks and only 3 cards, I ran every possible situation through my combinatorial program. The following table displays the results.

The dealer hits on soft 17. I wonder what the odds are of standing on 16 when the dealer’s upcard is 7. It seems only a 10 or face card can beat this and the odds would be in my favor if the dealer draws more than one card. Also, since most strategies are based on millions of calculations done on a computer, I wonder if those of us who will never play a million hands can rely on slight variations like this one. Is this a poor, fair or bad move to make?  Richard S. from Memphis, USA   According to my blackjack appendix 9H the expected return of standing is -0.476476 and of hitting is -0.408624, assuming the 16 is composed of a 10 and 6. So my hitting you will save 6.79 cents for each dollar bet. This is not even a marginal play. There is no sound bite answer to explain why you should hit. These expected values consider all the numerous ways the hand can play out. The best play for a billion hands is the best play for one hand. If you want to deviate from the basic strategy here are some borderline plays: 12 against 3, 12 against 4, 13 against 2, 16 against 10. Deviating on these hands will cost you much less.    My friend and I are debating two blackjack issues that arose from his Caribbean Vacation. (1) What shift in odds does the dealer NOT drawing the second card have? House favor or player favor? (2) in your simulations, what impact does the number of players have on the accuracy of the odds?  Beau from Toronto, Canada   (1) It depends what happens if the dealer does have a blackjack. If the player is guaranteed to lose no more than the original wager then it doesn’t matter if the dealer takes a second card or not. If the player stands to lose the total amount bet after doubling or splitting and the dealer gets a blackjack then that works to the dealer’s advantage. (2) I don’t have to simulate this because the number of players makes no difference.    In blackjack, what is the probability of a blackjack?  Anonymous   It depends on the number of decks. If the number of decks is n then the probability is 2*pr(ace)*pr(10) = 2*(1/13)*(16*n/(52*n-1)), which is conveniently about 1 in 21. 

Here is the exact answer for various numbers of decks.   Probability of Blackjack     Decks  Probability    1  4.827%    2  4.780%    3  4.764%    4  4.757%    5  4.752%    6  4.749%    7  4.747%    8  4.745%        What is the probability that you play ten hands and never obtain a (two-card) 21? Assume the cards are reshuffled after each play?  Matt from Radford, USA   If the probability of a blackjack is p then the probability of not getting any blackjacks in 10 hands is 1-(1-p) 10 . For example in a six deck game the answer would be 1- 0.952511 10 = 0.385251.    What are the odds of getting 3 blackjacks in a row with 1 deck 4 players and one dealer.  Joe P from Parma Heights, USA   I’m going to assume there is never a shuffle between hands. The three other players don’t matter. The answer would be 2 3 *(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47)= 0.00004401, or about 1 in 22722. If there were a shuffle between hands the probability would increase substantially.    In two handed blackjack using one deck, what is the probability of the dealer having a blackjack?  Steve from Solva, United Kingdom   The number of hands doesn’t matter. The probability is 2*(4/13)*(8/103) = 0.0478.    What are the odds of a dealer getting 3 blackjacks in a row on a single deck table with two players?  J.A.S. from Las Vegas, USA   It depends whether there is a shuffle between the blackjacks. Assuming there isn’t the probability would be 8*(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47) = 0.000044011058. The number of other players doesn’t matter, except if they cause a shuffle.    Dear Wizard, I was recently playing blackjack with somewhat of a card-shark who also happens to be my friend. We played casino rules, with one deck- and switched the deal after each time the deck expired. Later, while I was shuffling- I noticed two 9 of spades side by side. My friend obviously claimed he did not know about this, but it seems unlikely. My question is, if you were playing in a similar scenario and were to add one card to the deck, which card would be most advantageous if only you knew about it. Thank you for your time.  Matt   From my blackjack appendix 7 we see that each 9 removed from a single deck game increases the house edge by 0.20%. However if you were going to cheat it would be much better to remove an ace, which increases the house edge by 0.58%. If you were to add a card as the dealer you should add a 5, which increases the house edge by 0.80%. So, the best card for the player is the ace and the best for the dealer is the 5.    I’ve been playing blackjack for quite awhile using basic strategy, mostly betting an even unit each hand. Occasionally I will increase the bet because I "feel" like I am going to win the next one. I would think that just about all recreational players bet on feel once in a while at least. I was reading through some of your past Ask the Wizard columns and saw your calculation of the probability of a string of losses in the August 4, 2002 Column. You know those emotional thoughts that pop in head while gambling (well maybe not your head), "I’m due for a win!" That column seemed to put the mathematics to that "feeling" a player can get. In that columns’ example of a player losing 8 consecutive hands of blackjack the odds were (.5251^8 or about 1 in 173). My question though is what does that really mean? Is it that when I sit down at the table, 1 out of my next 173 playing sessions I can expect to have an 8 hand losing streak? Or does it mean that on any given loss it is a 1 in 173 chance that it was the first of 8 losses coming my way? I know, I know, its some sort of divine intervention betting system I am talking about and no betting system affects the house edge. I’m still curious though. Besides every once in awhile throwing down a bigger bet just adds to the excitement and for some reason it seems logical that if you have lost a string of hands you are "due" for a win.  Steve from Phoenix, AZ   I have no problem with increasing your bet when you get a lucky feeling. What is important is that you play your cards right. Unless you are counting cards you have the free will to bet as much as you want. As I always say all betting systems are equally worthless so flying by the seat of your pants is just as good as flat betting over the long term. When I said the probability of losing 8 hands in a row is 1 in 173 I meant that starting with the next hand the probability of losing 8 in a row is 1 in 173. The chances of 8 losses in a row over a session are greater the longer the session. I hope this answers your question.    Dear wiz, I am a blackjack dealer here in Vegas and the other night dealing, I had 4 out of the 6 ace of spades in my hand. I had A-A-K-A-A-10, so good think is I busted, but quick calculations on the game, we figured getting 4 out of the six aces on one had is around 7mil to 1. Is this number a little high?  Jason   The probability of this occurring in which your other two cards are any two 10-point cards is 4*COMBIN(6,4)*COMBIN(6*16,2)*(4/6)*(3/5)*(1/2)/combin(312,6) 1 in 22,307,231. However there are other ways you get four aces in the same hand, for example the last card might be an 8 or 9. I would have to do a computer simulation to consider all the other combinations. However to make a rough guess I’d say the 7 million looks about right.    After performing my own infinite deck analysis for Blackjack with the same rules as yours (dealer stands all 17s, re-splitting allowed to 4 hands except Aces, which can only be split once, doubling after splitting, draw only one card to split Aces), I came across your site. In comparing expected values, I obtained the same numbers as you in all cases, except for pair splitting, which were slightly different. So I’m wondering how you went about your calculation of expected values for splitting?  Anonymous   It took me years to get the splitting pairs correct myself. Cindy of Gambling Tools was very helpful. Peter Griffin also addresses this topic in chapter 11 of the The Theory of Blackjack Let’s say I want to determine the expected value of splitting eights against a dealer 2. Resplitting up to four hands is allowed. Here is how I did it.   Take a 2 and two 8’s out of the shoe. Determine the probability that the player will not get a third eight on either hand. Go through all ranks, except 8, subtract that card from the deck, play out a hand with that card and an 8, determine the expected value, and multiply by 2. For each rank determine the probability of that rank, given that the probability of another 8 is zero. Take the dot product of the probability and expected value over each rank. Multiply this dot product by the probability from step 2. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 3 hands. Take another 8 out of the deck. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 3 instead of 2. Multiply dot product from step 7 by probability in step 5. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 4 hands. Take two more 8’s out of the shoe. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 4 instead of 2, and this time consider getting an 8 as a third card, corresponding to the situation where the player is forced to stop resplitting. Multiply dot product from step 11 by probability in step 9. Add values from steps 4, 8, and 12. The hardest part of all this is step 3. I have a very ugly subroutine full of long formulas I determine using probability trees. It gets especially ugly when the dealer has a 10 or ace up.    Dear wiz, How do you calculate the probability of getting three sevens, three colored sevens, and three suited sevens in blackjack?  Geoff   Let’s assume six decks of cards and the player always takes a third card (whether by hitting or splitting). The number of ways to draw 3 suited sevens is the number of suits (4) times the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 sevens of that suit in the shoe. In other words 4× combin (6,3)=4×20=80. The number of ways to draw 3 colored sevens, including 3 suited sevens, is the number of colors times the number of ways to pick 3 out of the 12 sevens in the shoe of that color, or 2×combin(12,3)=2×220=440. The number of ways to draw any 3 sevens, including 3 colored and suited sevens, is the number of ways to pick 3 cards out of the 24 sevens in the shoe, or combin(24,3)=2024. The total number of combinations for any 3 cards out of 312 is combin(312,3)=5013320. So the probability of 3 suited sevens is 80/5013320=0.000015957. The probability of three colored, but not suited, sevens is (440-80)/5013320=0.0000718. The probability of three sevens of mixed colors is (2024-440)/5013320= 0.00031596.    Good job and well done. The question: I notice from your May 5, 2003 Column that you actually CALCULATE your blackjack odds. I am a bit surprised that you were not using your computer to SIMULATE the results. Or is this a stupid question, i.e., the computer will take a million years to do the job?  Anonymous   Yes, I calculate blackjack odds using a combinatorial approach, analyzing every possible ways the player and dealer cards can come out, taking the greatest expected value at every decision point. This is harder to program than a simulation but I feel is more elegant and a nice challenge in recursive programming. However I still respect my peers to do simulations. With today’s computers it doesn’t take long to run off a billion bets, which gets very close to the optimal strategy return.    I recently went to Vegas and had an incredible hand of blackjack... received an ace as first card, split, received another ace, split, received a third ace, split, and got one last ace... Then was dealt blackjack on all 4 hands! No lie! 2 of my friends were witnesses, as was the entire Luxor gaming gods...What are the odds on this? It was a 6 card deck shoe, I was sitting in #3 seat of a 4 person game. Assume a fresh shuffle?  Anonymous   Not too many places allow resplitting aces, so be glad you were playing somewhere that did. Your seat position does not matter. The probability of this is the probability that the first four cards out of the shoe are aces, and the next four are tens, or (combin(24,4)/combin(312,4))*(combin(96,4)/combin(308,4)) = 1 in 4,034,213.    I just witnessed a friend get four blackjacks in a row starting with the first hand of a newly shuffled single deck playing head to head against the dealer. I looked at the FAQ’s and saw the odds for getting one blackjack in single deck, but don’t know how to calculate them for getting four in a row off the top. Instead of a decimal probability, could you tell me the odds of this? It must be astronomical. Hope to hear from you.  Anonymous   I seem to get a variation of this question at least once a month. Let’s assume for now the deck is shuffled after every hand, to make the math easier. If the probability of something happening is p then the probability of it happening n times in a row is p n . The probability of a blackjack in a single deck game is 4*16/combin(52,2) = 64/1326. So the probability of four in a row is (64/1326) 4 = 16777216/ 3091534492176 = 1 in 184270. However the actual probability is much less, because as the player gets each blackjack the ratio of aces to cards left in the deck decreases. Without knowing what cards the dealer got I can’t tell you the exact answer.    First I wanted to tell you how much I look at and love your web site, and admire your math skills. I use 6 decks to deal blackjack, and added 3 jokers for reasons I won’t waste your time with but, what are the odds of dealing all 3 jokers to a player right in a row. Thank you very much.  Anonymous   You’re welcome, thanks for you compliments. The probability of being dealt 3 jokers in a row from a six deck shoe (plus the 3 jokers) is 1/combin(315,3) = 1 in 5,159,805. Another solution is (3/315)*(2/314)*(1/313).    Michael, a person asked you if they are not counting cards in blackjack, what difference does it make how many decks are being used. You stated the difference had mostly to do with the number of stiff hands possible, due to the fact that if a small card came out it was more likely a large card would follow and vice-a-versa. How could that be? Would it still not be a random event with the possibility of a small or large card coming out being equal, if you are not counting?  Anonymous   Every legitimate blackjack expert agrees the house edge decreases as the number of decks goes down, all other rules being equal. However it is hard to explain why. First, it is true that you are more likely to get one small card and one big card in single-deck than multiple-deck. For example if we define a small card as 2 through 6, and a large card as any 10-point card or ace then the probability of getting one of each in single deck is 2*(20/52)*(20/51) = 30.17%. The probability in 8-decks is 2*(160/416)*(160/415) = 29.66%. Although stiffs can cut both ways the player has the free will to stand, the dealer must always hit them.    At a single deck game what is the probability all three players and the dealer get a blackjack the first round after a shuffle?  Anonymous   Following are the probabilities: Player 1 0.048265 Player 2 0.036735 Player 3 0.024823 Dealer 0.012560 The product is 1 in 1,808,986.    Mr. Wizard, Great site. There is a lot of useful and interesting info. I’d like to see more of the mathematics and possible sources of simulations (source code, books, etc.) behind the games. Where would you suggest that a person interested in writing something similar to your "blackjack house edge calculator" go for more info? Thank you for your response.  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. I’m afraid I know of no source, including myself, that shows code for game analysis. It took me years to get my blackjack engine to work perfectly (splits when the dealer had a 10 or ace showing was very tricky). An easier way to get the house edge for blackjack is to write a random simulation. One of these days I would like to write a book on how I analyzed the games, but I’m afraid only you would buy it.    What is the probability of a blackjack for n decks?  Anonymous   2*(4/13)*(4n/(52n-1))    I am a blackjack dealer and last night I amazed my table on a single-deck blackjack game (the horrible 6 to 5). My hand consisted of an Ace up, Ace in the hole and then I drew the other 2 Aces and then a 7 for 21! What are the odds of this happening and I am especially interested in knowing the math. Thanks!  Anonymous   The probability is (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49)*(4/48) = 1 in 3,248,700.    In blackjack, what is the probability of the dealer making a stopping hand (17-21) drawing eight cards? This happened to a friend of mine online and I think it's an extremely rare occurrence. How about seven cards? Thanks for the great site and keep up the awesome work!  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. Assuming a six-deck game, where the dealer stands on soft 17, and the player plays basic strategy here are the rounded results based on a 100-million hand simulation.

Also, does increasing the amount available for total wagering increase the likelihood of winning the $200.  Anonymous   If you had a game with no house edge the probability of winning $200 with $5000 to risk, using any system, would be 5000/(5000+200) = 96.15%. The general formula for winning w with a bankroll of b is b/(b+w). So the larger the bankroll the better your chances. The house edge will lower the probability of success by an amount that is hard to quantify. For a low house edge game like blackjack, the reduction in the probability of success will be small. It would take a random simulation to know for sure. Forgive me if I don't bother with that. VegasClick did a small simulation about the probability of success with the Martingale .    As I read your analysis of the Royal Match side bet in blackjack , am I correct that your odds are for the first hand of the shoe? If so, wouldn’t the real-world odds of an easy match be tilted a bit more toward the player? It seems to me that if the suits get unbalanced in any direction it would slightly lessen the house edge, and the suits will certainly fluctuate through the shoe.  Frank from Michigan   This is not true.  The remaining deck needs to be exhibit more than a certain degree of skewness for the odds to swing to the player's favor.  Consider a hypothetical side that pays 3 to 1 for any suited pair in a one-deck game.  Of the top of the deck the probability of winning is 4* combin (13,2)/combin(52,2) = 23.53%.  However if you burn two cards of different suits the probability of winning goes down to 2*(combin(13,2)+combin(12,2))/combin(50,2) = 23.51%.  If you burn two cards of the same suit the probability of winning increases to (3*combin(13,2)+combin(11,2))/combin(52,2) = 23.59%. If one card of each rank were removed the probability of winning would go down to 4*combin(12,2)/combin(48,2) = 23.40%.  What all this shows is that if cards are removed at a uniform distribution the odds of winning go down, however at a very skewed distribution the odds go up. As the deck is played down sometimes your odds get better, and sometimes worse, but in the long run they average out and stay at a 23.53% chance of winning.    I have been a dealer for 27 years and have seen a lot.  One of my favorites was a guy who never looked at his cards playing blackjack....just tucked them.  I thought he was nuts of course but some days he won and some days he lost.  Just like most people.  I tried this myself on a free gambling website and won 2 out of 3 times gambling 20 minute sessions.  My question is this:  How much worse off are you doing this than trying to play basic strategy?  I really don’t think it matters much at all what you do in blackjack for the ’average’ player.  Mark from Las Vegas   Under typical Vegas rules (6-deck, dealer hits soft 17) the house edge by always standing is 15.7%.  In the short-run one could still overcome that, but in the long run you’ll lose badly.    I lost a lot of money playing Cryptologic Blackjack today.  While I don’t think anything is fixed, one aspect of my play seemed well outside the range of probability.  Within 35 hands, the dealer showed a 6 seven times and won each time.  This was verified through the logs.  If the probability of a dealer bust is 56% with a six, my calculation suggests the odds of this independent event happening six consecutive times is 0.23%.  Adam from Toronto   At Cryptologic they use 8 decks and the dealer stands on a soft 17.  According to my blackjack appendix 2 , the probability of the dealer busting with a 6 up is 0.422922.  So the probability of not busing is 1 - 0.422922 = 0.577078.  The probability of not busing 7 times out of 7 is (0.577078) 7 = 2.13%.    First off, my apologies if you consider this a basic math question.  I’m a dealer at a Northern Ontario casino, and last night (for the dealer) drew a 12-card 17 (A-A-A-A-A-A-6-A-A-A-A-A).  We use six decks.  Neither my player or I had ever seen this before.  What are the odds of this?  Timothy Rowland from Orilila   Wow!  The probability of this is (combin(24,6)/combin(312,6)) * (24/306) * (combin(18,5)/combin(305,5)) = 1 in 287,209,346,813,617.    I am a pit supervisor at a local casino and recently had a dealer deal two players two seven of clubs each and give himeself the last seven of clubs as his upcard on a five-deck shoe.  What are the odds of five of the same card coming out of a five-deck shoe in order?  Jesse from Scottsdale   That probability would be 52/ combin (260,5) = 5/9525431552 = 1 in 1,905,086,310.    According to standard BJ rules and perfect basic strategy, how many percent of my DOUBLED DOWN hands should I expect to win, push and lose?  Cameron from Melbourne, Australia   Assuming liberal Vegas Strip rules (six decks, dealer stands on soft 17, double after split allowed, late surrender allowed, resplitting aces allowed) the following are the probabilities of each possible outcome when doubling on the initial two cards.  This does not include doubling after splitting.   Win: 54.99% Lose: 38.06% Draw: 6.95%  I’ve played a lot of Blackjack over the years but have never struck anything like the situation I experienced on the weekend.  Playing $25 a hand I lost 19 hands in a row with no pushes.  One of the hands was a double down, so effectively I lost 20 x $25 bets in a row. I was playing strict Basic Strategy for New Zealand conditions (not counting, CSM in use).  Have you ever heard of such a horror streak?  I was ahead about $300 when the sky fell in but stuck to the strategy and eventually left the session $200 ahead and very relieved.  My calculations estimate the probability of 19 straight losses as 1 chance in about 207,000; you may well correct me on this.  I play to a betting progression system, purely for discipline/money management purposes which has me betting 1 unit after every loss.  Had I done anything differently, I would have been cleaned out well before the 19 hands came up.  Ken from Auckland, New Zealand   From my blackjack appendix 4 we see the following probabilities for each initial hand.    Win 42.43% Lose 49.09% Draw 8.48%  So the probability of going exactly 19 losses in a row is 0.4909^19*(1-0.4909) = 1 in 1,459,921.  By way of comparison, the probability of being dealt a royal flush in video poker is 1 in 649,740, or 2.25 times as likely.  Avid video poker players have been known to receive several dealt royals, so if you play a lot of blackjack you’ll likely hit such a losing streak eventually.    I’m totally baffled!  If in an 8-deck or continuous shuffle blackjack game there is no difference in the probabilities of a card appearing at any time, why have you posted Blackjack Appendix #18 ?  If the probabilities say hit on 16 vs. 7 or higher, how can the probabilities change if you have 5 or 6 cards as opposed to 2 cards?  16 is 16 no matter how you construct it, right?  I see the change if the deck is shrinking or in a game like Spanish 21 where there is a bonus for 21 with 5 or more cards, but why in an 8-deck game or continuous shuffle?  Ernie from Toledo   The reason the strategy changes, according to the number of cards in your hand, as shown in appendix 18, is that every card that leaves the deck changes the probabilities of every card left to be played.  A good example is the single-deck basic strategy says to surrender 7,7 against a 10; but for any other 14 you should hit.  The reason you should surrender is half the sevens have already been removed from the deck.  You need another seven to make 21, the only hand that will beat a dealer 20.  So the shortage of sevens lowers the expected value of hitting to under half a bet, making surrender the better play. In an eight-deck shoe there are 416 cards.  That may seem like a lot, but 16 against a 10 is such a borderline hand that removal of just one card can making standing a better play.  The rule is that for eight or fewer decks if your 16 is composed of three or more cards, and the dealer has a 10, then you should stand. In a two-card 16 the average points per card is 8, with a 3-card 16 the average is 5.33.  With more small cards out of the deck in the 3-card hand the remaining deck becomes more large card rich, making hitting more dangerous, swaying the odds in favor of standing.    Hi Wizard.  Thanks for maintaining this web site! I have a question about a blackjack rule that is applied in Dutch casinos: When being dealt a pair of sevens, a third seven will earn you 2:1 on your bet, regardless if you win the hand or not. However, this only applies when the sevens have NOT been split. I know that there are 6 dealer up cards in basic strategy that allow splitting sevens and 7 that do not, so the player should have an edge in this particular situation. But what are the odds of being dealt 3 sevens in blackjack in the first place? And if dealt 3 sevens, what are the odds they qualify for the 2:1 pay-out rule, based on a 4 to 6 decks, dealer stands on soft 17 basic strategy chart? Hope you can figure this one out for me. Keep up the good work!  Stan from The Netherlands, Europe   I show that rule is worth 0.026% to the player.  Despite the incentive to hit 7,7 against a dealer 2-7, the player should still follow basic strategy and split.    I have a friend who starts complaining when his first card is a six, without waiting to see what his second card and the dealer’s up card are.  I think he should wait because he could get a two, three, four, five, etc. (i.e., a decent second card) OR the dealer could show a two through six (a good card for the table).  What do you think?  How much worse are his odds of winning with a first card of six without knowing this second card or the dealer’s up card? Or is my friend just a whiner?  Thank you for your time.  Scott from Long Beach   My blackjack appendix 14 shows that if your first card is a six your expected value is already about −21%.  For example, if he bet $100, a fair price to sell the hand and bet would be about $79. Maybe you can take advantage of his complaining by offering to buy his hand for less than the fair 79 cents on the dollar.  I’d suggest 75 cents on the dollar, to give you an edge, without taking too much advantage.    Bally Gaming has a single-deck, multi-hand, blackjack game.  The player plays seven hands against a single dealer hand.  There is an interesting rule in that if the game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  What is the probability of running out of cards?  Can have suggest any strategy changes to run out the deck?  Michael L. from West Mifflin, PA   For the benefit of other readers, the full set of rules is:   Single deck. Dealer stands on soft 17. Winning blackjack pays even money. Player may double any first two cards. No double after split. Player may resplit to four hands, including aces. No draw to split aces. No surrender. Six-card Charlie (player unbusted six cards automatically wins). Cards shuffled after every hand. If game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  The house edge using total-dependent basic strategy is 2.13%.  I ran a 7-player simulation, using total-dependent basic strategy, and the average number of cards used per round was 21.65, with a standard deviation of 2.72.  In almost 190 million rounds played, the most cards ever used was 42, which happened 7 times. It is my educated opinion that even with computer perfect composition-dependent strategy the player would still realistically never see the last card.  You could cut down the house edge much more using composition-dependent strategy, according to all the cards seen as you go along.  However bucking 2.13% house edge to start with, you’ll never get anywhere near break-even, regardless of how hard you try.    Recently, the Tuscany casino ran a promotion where if you got 30 blackjacks in a 30-day period, you would win a $100 bonus. At first, the minimum bet was $5 to get your card stamped. However, I later heard the minimum for a stamp was raised to $15. I wrote a letter of complaint about it to the casino manager, stating in part:   I just wanted to express my disappointment in this change, if it is true. I never had a chance to take advantage of the promotion and doubt I will be able to now. The amount of time necessary to receive 30 blackjacks (I’m told about 8 hours of continuous play) seems unreasonable at $15/hand when the promotion still offers only $100.  Here is the reply I received:  In response to your e-mail on the blackjack blackout promotion, I’m not sure where you received your information on how long it takes to complete the blackout card. We’ve seen players complete the card in less than four hours. Also, you have thirty days in which to complete the card. I hope you understand this is not a task that is unreachable with that much time. I THANK YOU for your letter. It’s good to hear feedback from our customers. Hope you can give it a try and win some money! What is the probability of getting 30 blackjacks in four hours?  nyuhoosier   According to my game comparison , blackjack players play about 70 hands per hour.  The probability of a blackjack in a six-deck game is 24*96/combin(312,2)=4.75%.  I assume a blackjack tie still gets a stamp.  So it should take about 30/0.0475=632 hands to fill the card, or 9.02 hours. The probability of filling the card in 4 hours, assuming 280 hands, is 1 in 30,000 playing one hand at a time.  I suspect any player achieving the goal in four hours was playing at least two hands at a time. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas .    On a recent Vegas trip I saw the dealer get a 9-card 21.  The rules were six decks and the dealer stood on soft 17.  What are the odds of that?  aceofspades   The probability of the dealer getting exactly a 9-card 21 under those rules is 1 in 32,178,035.

It’s because they often make some or all of the following common mistakes.    MISTAKE 1: NOT CHECKING THE PLAYING RULES  Most players just plop themselves down at the first open blackjack seat that they spot. That is often a big mistake because not all blackjack games are created equal. Some games have a good mix of player-favorable rules, like the dealer stands on soft 17, and you can double down after pair splitting, while others have terrible rules, like a player blackjack pays 6-5, or doubling is restricted to 10 or 11 only.  A casino manager isn’t going to point you to his more player-favorable games. Nope, that’s your responsibility. Therefore, it behooves a player to check the rules before sitting down to play. Is the dealer going to pay you 3-2 on a blackjack? Does the dealer stand or hit on soft 17? Can you double down after pair splitting? Is surrender offered? Playing at a table with horrible rules can doom a player.     MISTAKE 2: NOT USING BASIC STRATEGY  Playing blackjack is not a guessing game, where sometimes you hit your 16 against a dealer’s 10 upcard, and for whatever reason, other times you stand. The mathematically correct way to play every hand has been determined by brilliant mathematicians and this strategy is known as the basic playing strategy. The latter is available in books and on the Internet (including my Ultimate Guide to Blackjack ). The strategy is shown in tables and charts and it tells you the right way to play every hand. So if you hold a 9-9 and the dealer’s upcard is a 9, there is one and only one correct way to play this hand. It doesn’t matter if you are playing in a casino in Las Vegas, the Midwest, Biloxi, or Atlantic City, or whether you just lost or won the last five hands, or whether you have been winning or losing money, or whether your gut is telling you to stand, the correct play is to split. You don’t split sometimes, and stand other times. You always split. You must play like a robot, and always make the correct basic strategy play regardless of everything else. If you can’t or won’t accept this, then you should play a different game because you will never be successful at blackjack.   MISTAKE 3: TRYING TO BEAT THE HOUSE WITH A BETTING PROGRESSION  It seems players have a fascination with betting progressions, where you bet more or less based on the results of previous hands, because they mistakenly believe they can win with them. Well they can’t and they won’t. You are fighting a losing battle if you use a betting progression for one simple reason. In the history of blackjack, there has never been any mathematical study that proves your chances of winning the next hand will improve based on the results (win or lose) of the previous hands. Betting progressions are not the magic bullet that will help you win at blackjack. And yes, in the short run when you get to make some adrenaline-pumping big bets, according to whatever progression you are using, they can be fun to use but in the long run, guess what? The house edge against you won’t change one iota. And what’s worse is you will lose more money using a betting progression in the long haul compared to just betting the same amount on every hand because with a betting progression you will be exposing a greater amount of your bankroll to the house edge, so the more money you bet, the more money you stand to lose. Nope, betting progressions don’t work in the long run so forget about it.  MISTAKE 4: INCREASING YOUR BET BECAUSE YOU ARE DUE TO WIN  Most blackjack players mistakenly believe that blackjack is close to a 50-50 proposition so if they lose several hands in a row, they reason the odds must be better for them to win the next hand so they make a bigger bet.  Remember what I said earlier about past results not affecting future results in blackjack? This holds true even after you’ve had a bad run of losing several consecutive hands. Your chance of winning the next hand in blackjack is about 48% (excluding ties), regardless of what happened in previous hands. The only time you should bet more in blackjack is when you know you have the best of it (i.e., by card counting - check your skills with the card counting trainer ) and not when you think that you are “due to win.”   MISTAKE 5: PLAYING ON A BLACKJACK TABLE THAT USES A CONTINUOUS SHUFFLING MACHINE (CSM)  A CSM is an automatic shuffling device that also dispenses the cards to the dealer to deal to players. Many casinos nowadays use CSMs on their tables because it speeds up the game and it also discourages card counters. A CSM usually contains four or five decks of cards, and after every round, the dealer places the discards back into the CSM where the cards are randomly shuffled. Because a live blackjack dealer never stops dealing to manually shuffle the cards, she can deal more hands per hour to players. This exposes more of a player’s bankroll to the house edge, resulting in an increase in a player’s theoretical hourly loss. Average players need to slow down their play, which they can do by playing on a table where the dealer hand shuffles the cards, rather than on one that uses a CSM.   MISTAKE 6: PLAYING 6-5 GAMES  I casually mentioned this in Mistake #1 but because 6-5 blackjack games are proliferating it bears repeating. When a casino pays 6-5 (or 7-6, or worse, even money) for a blackjack, that’s a horrible game. In a single-deck game, the house edge zooms to 1.39%; if blackjack pays only even money, the house edge increases even more to 2.3%. It’s not only single-deck games that have 6-5 payoffs. Nowadays, you’ll find 6-5 payoffs on double- and multi-deck games. Be especially vigilant about blackjack games in so-called party pits, where blackjack payoffs are usually 6-5 or even money. You’ll pay big time for the eye-candy in party pits. Bottom line: Don’t make the mistake of playing a 6-5 blackjack game. Check the rules posted on the table or ask the dealer. If the game doesn’t pay 3-2 for a blackjack, walk away (better yet, run).   MISTAKE 7: ALWAYS MAKING THE INSURANCE BET  I covered the insurance bet in Chapter 2.6 but it bears repeating that this bet is an unprofitable bet for basic strategy players. Casinos have fooled players into believing this is a good bet because it “insures” or “protects” their main bet from losing against a dealer’s blackjack.  This is far from the truth because the insurance bet neither increases nor decreases your chance of winning the original bet. Plain and simple, the insurance bet is nothing more than a side bet on whether or not the dealer has a ten in the hole (i.e., her downcard) and, consequently, a blackjack. Without any information on the composition of the cards in the deck, you have no earthly idea if the dealer’s downcard is a ten, which is why insurance should never be taken by basic strategy players. Note: Card counters, on the other hand, have information on the composition of the deck; therefore, insurance is a profitable bet for them. I’ll cover this in Chapter 10.  MISTAKE 8: PLAYING TIRED OR INEBRIATED  Have you even seen a bleary-eyed or inebriated blackjack player winning? Neither have I. Yes, I know alcoholic drinks are free when you play, and after a long trip, you can’t wait to get on the blackjack tables.  However, you must have a clear head when you play blackjack because you have to use your brain to make playing decisions. Drinking too much alcohol or playing when tired will just cloud your thinking process, leading to playing mistakes. Play first, drink later: and only play blackjack when you are well rested.

The dealer stands on soft 17. Also, in the event that both dealer and player gets blackjack, it is a push. There is no insurance policy and 21 on both sides are always a tie.  I have 10,000 credits to work with.  With the Martingale betting system , I figured that I am more likely to gain a profit than to lose credits. But I'm not quite sure how to calculate the math behind this and how to calculate the probability for winning a single blackjack hand.  I figured with 10,000 credits, I can start my bet at 1, then go to 2, then 4, etc (doubling my bet everytime I lose). This allows me to lose up to 12 hands before I am bankrupt. On the other hand, if I win any of these 12 hands, I gain profit and just reset my bet to 1 again. The way I see it, I have over a 50% chance to win at least one of these 12 hands, thus always profiting.  Am I favored to gain profit in this specific type of blackjack? How can I calculate the probability for this?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Oct 7 '13 at 21:23       krikara   238 2 6 14                  Eventually you will lose your entire bankroll because it is finite. – Dan Rust  Oct 7 '13 at 21:27             @DanielRust What's the probability of that? – krikara  Oct 7 '13 at 21:36            You could actually play $13$ hands with doubling.

That is, if you play long enough, you will hit the $13$ hand unlucky streak. – Dan Rust  Oct 7 '13 at 21:53         add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote      Whether the game is in your favor is independent of the betting system.  No system of betting can rescue a losing game.  You are correct that with Martingale you are more likely to win than lose a given series, but if the basic bet is losing the losses will be large and probable enough to give a negative expectation.  For your example, if your chance of winning an individual hand is $0.49.0.50,0.51$, your chance of losing $12$ in a row is about $0.000310,0.000244,0.000191$.  If you lose $12$ in a row, you lose $4095$, so the expectation of a series is $-0.268,0,0.215$  You can't calculate the chance of winning a hand until you specify the strategy you will follow. It is still too complicated to compute by hand, so people resort to computer modeling.  You use a random  number generator to deal a lot of hands and count how many you win.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 22 '14 at 15:05      user940        answered Oct 7 '13 at 21:48       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I was recently curious about this betting strategy as well. Instead of trying to figure out the math behind it, I wrote a simple computer program that runs 1000 trials at each permutation of start balance, base wager, and target. The model assumes a coin toss for each trial 50% chance of success (random trial number based on uniform distribution).  The betting strategy doubles your base wager each loss, and returns it to the base wager after each win. The table below shows the frequency of wins (win=reaching target balance without running out of money). To start, I tested identical proportions of parameters to compare results. So far I'm attributing the variance in results to statistical error.  I conclude that you can increase your odds of doubling your money by around 9%. It's somewhat obvious, but you maximize your gain by using the lowest base wager as percentage of start balance. The maximum avg run length was 15 trials, so I'd say this is definitely a feasible betting strategy.  If anyone out there knows how to mathematically model this, I would be happy to test out the mathematical theory and compare against the program.      share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 13 '14 at 1:03       Jonathan   11 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      I 've done the calculation in mathematica (as well as excel to double check).

Typically, if the dealer shows an Ace or 10-value card (10,J,Q,K) the dealer will "peek" at their second card and check for Blackjack. If Blackjack is discovered all players (except those with Blackjack also) will lose immediately and the next round is dealt - this speeds up the game and thus speeds up casino profits.  If the dealer does not peek for Blackjack this calculation is easy:  For example, suppose the dealer shows a 4 and the player shows 2,3. Then the probability our next card will be a 5 is simply 4/49 (4 5's left in 49 remaining cards). The dealer's down-card is equally likely to be any of the 49 remaining cards and thus shouldn't affect the probability at all, we simply ignore it.

Ignore the irrelevant stuff.  A good starting place with this kind of problem is "can you solve it if there are only 2 cards in the deck?"  "If there are only 3 cards?" – DanielV  Jun 7 '17 at 2:45             What exactly are you trying to calculate?  You mention the probability of an Ace, the probability of a non-Ace, but don't say anything specific.  Also, as noted many casinos use many decks for blackjack to make card counting and rich decks less common.

Intuitively, because we know the dealer doesn't have an Ace, we should be more likely to receive an Ace (or less likely to receive a non-Ace) - but I'm unsure how to calculate this exactly.   You know that four cards are not in the deck 10,2,3, and another non-ace, leaving 48 cards in the deck.  The four aces may be anyhere in the deck with equal probability, so the probability the next card drawn is an ace is $4/48$.  $$\mathsf P(X=A\mid P_1=2, P_2=3, D_1=10, D_2\neq A) = \tfrac 4{48}$$  For other cards we must also consider the probability that it is the dealer's second card.   One of the kings, say, will be the dealer's second card with a probability of $4/(52-3-4)$.  On condition that one is, the probability that one from the other three kings is the next card is $3/48$, and on condition that the dealer's second card also ins't a king, the probability that the next card is one from the four kings is is: $4/48$.   So by total probability, for any from the nine such cards that are not showing (or an ace):  $$\mathsf P(X=K\mid P_1=2, P_2=3, D_1=10, D_2\neq A) ~{ = ~\tfrac 4{45}\tfrac 3{48}+\tfrac{41}{45}\tfrac 4{48} \\[1ex]=~ \dfrac{11}{135}}$$  Similarly, for cards that are showing, such as 2,3,10:  $$\mathsf P(X=2\mid P_1=2, P_2=3, D_1=10, D_2\neq A) ~{ = ~\tfrac 3{45}\tfrac 2{48}+\tfrac{42}{45}\tfrac 3{48} \\[1ex]=~ \dfrac{11}{180}}$$   You can now work out probabilities if the player and dealer are showing two or three cads from the same kind.   Reality Check: $3\cdot\tfrac{11}{180}+9\cdot\tfrac{11}{135}+\tfrac 1{12} = 1$ as it ought right should.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 7 '17 at 3:33       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      For the question in the comment:  dealer has $10$ plus non-ace, player has $2,3$ what is the chance the next card is $5$.

The player and the dealer. The aim of this game is to get as close to $21$ without going over, using six sided dice which has an equal chance of landing on each side. Both parties may use as many dice as they like. If the player goes over 21 then they lose and similarly to casino blackjack, the player's turn is first. For the purpose of this question, assume that the player will always keep (stay) the value of either 19, 20, 21 and would continue if the value is 18 or under. If there is a draw then the game is repeated and there is no winner.   Thanks in advance and I hope this is enough information to draw a reasonable answer.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question      edited Mar 22 '13 at 15:52       A.D   3,725 11 34        asked Mar 22 '13 at 15:36       Zonzzoz   31 1                  If the only thing you need is one number (likelihood of winning) for this one case, may be writing a simulation is faster. – gt6989b  Mar 22 '13 at 15:54            Knowing the probability distribution of the sum of 21 fair 6-sided standard dice would completely solve your problem.

I suppose you want to know what the player's expected loss is.  Nor have you said how the bank adjusts to the player's behaviour.  For example, what happens if the player stays/sticks at 20 and the bank reaches 19?  Let's assume the bank is also required to follow the same rule as you give for the player, but if they both bust by going over 21 then the bank wins.  Then the probability the player busts  is about $0.286205909$ (not that far away from $\frac27$, the limit of probability that the player if throwing indefinitely hits a particular large number).  Similarly for the bank.  So the probability they both bust is this squared, i.e. about $0.081913822$ (not far away from $\frac{4}{49}$).  This is the only unfair part of the game so it is the player's expected loss if she has staked $1$.  To calculate the probability of a bust, try $p_0=1$, $p_n=\frac16 \sum_{i=0}^{i=n-1} p_i$ for $1 \le i \le 6$, $p_n=\frac16 \sum_{i=n-6}^{i=n-1} p_i$ for $6 \le i \le 19$, $p_n=\frac16 \sum_{i=n-6}^{i=18} p_i$ for $19 \le i \le 24$, and then add up $p_{22}+p_{23}+p_{24}$.  The values of $p_n$ are about  n   p_n

I apologise for not including that additional information in the original question. If the player stays on 20 and the dealer reaches 19 then the dealer will continue. So the dealer will always continue as long as the dealer's value is less than that of the player's value. If the player busts then the dealer wins and if the dealer busts then the player wins. I would like to know the probability of the Dealer winning and a draw occurring, where nobody wins. – Zonzzoz  Mar 23 '13 at 5:33            Oh also, in regards to a draw.. The player would stay on 19, 20 or 21. In this case, if the dealer's value reaches the same value as the player (i.e. player reaches 20, stays. Then the dealer reaches 20. The dealer stays and nobody wins.). Thanks again. – Zonzzoz  Mar 23 '13 at 5:36        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Your comments on my other answer suggests that the bank plays knowing what the player has.  This would not happen in a casino, partly because there may be more than one player, but if you apply that peeking here then you get the same probabilities for the player:  Player      19      20      21  Bust
        0.2847  0.2382  0.1909  0.2862  Given the player's score, the probabilities for the banker's score are  Player      19      20      21
Bank            
19      0.2847      
20      0.2382  0.2856  
21      0.1909  0.2384  0.2860
Bust    0.2862  0.4760  0.7140  So given the player's score, the probabilities for the outcome are  Player      19      20      21  Bust
PlayWin 0.2862  0.4760  0.7140  
Draw    0.2847  0.2856  0.2860  
BankWin 0.4291  0.2384          1  So multiplying these by the probabilities of the player's score and adding them up gives  Player wins 0.3312
Draw        0.2037
Bank wins   0.4651  With the approximation these would be close to $\frac{146}{441}$, $\frac{90}{441}$, $\frac{205}{441}$.  The player's expected loss is about $0.133966$, rather more than the other answer, because this time the banker is peeking at the player's score.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 23 '13 at 13:52       Henry   87.9k 3 63 133              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

So I deleted the more complicated answer I tried to give earlier.  The total # of possible deals to the two players is: $$\binom{52}{2}\binom{50}{2}=1,624,350$$
(i.e., choose two cards for the first player and then two for the second.)  Then, the # of ways to deal a blackjack to both players would be: $$\binom{4}{1}\binom{16}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{15}{1}=2880$$
(i.e, choose which ace to give to the first player, then which 10,J,Q,K for the first player, then which ace for the second player, and then which 10,J,Q,K for the second player.)  Also, the # of ways that exactly one player gets a blackjack would be: $$\binom{2}{1}\binom{4}{1}\binom{16}{1}\times(\binom{3}{2}+\binom{3}{1}\binom{32}{1}+\binom{47}{2})=151,040$$
(i.e., choose which player to give the blackjack, then choose which ace to give them, and then which 10,J,Q,K to give them. Then for the other player we either give them two aces from the 3 that are left, give them one ace from the 3 that are left and 1 of the 32 2-9 cards, or give them two non-aces from the 47 non-aces that are left.)  So, the probability of at least one player getting a blackjack is: $$\frac{2880+151,040}{1,624,350}$$  Hence the probability of neither player getting a blackjack is: $$1- \frac{2880+151,040}{1,624,350} \approx 90.5\%$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 11 '15 at 4:30       Michael Cotton   623 3 6                  If the player goes blackjack or busts, the dealer doesn't get to draw, so there is some conditioning between the events that may need to be addressed. – Avraham  Feb 11 '15 at 4:40            @Avraham: we are concerned with blackjack before the dealer (or even the players) draws, so this is not an issue. – Ross Millikan  Feb 11 '15 at 4:53            I had the same interpretation as Ross. – Michael Cotton  Feb 12 '15 at 2:32            Very clever Michael Cotton, thank you.

So the odds of not getting blackjack the first hand would be ((52*51)-((4*16)*2))/(52*51) after which point you know the deck is either out one or two face cards, out one or two aces, or neither. This happens every time. (until there are no more other cards, at least)  hand#       aces,face-cards     total cards

As you say, the chance than one player does not get blackjack is $\frac {2524}{2652}$  The chance that none of $n$ players gets blackjack is then $\left(\frac {2524}{2652}\right)^n$.  This is not quite correct, as the fact that the first player did not get blackjack enriches the average deck with cards that could make a blackjack for the second player.  Because the chance of one player getting blackjack is small, the enrichment is small as well, so this is not far off.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 10 '15 at 4:34       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      It might be a little simpler to deal with three separate probabilities:  Since there are four aces and 16 cards 10-K, the raw probability of a hand being blackjack is:  $$P_\text{blackjack} = \frac {4 \times 16} {\binom {52} {2}}.$$  The probability of both getting blackjack is just the probability of the player getting blackjack and the subsequent probability of the dealer also getting blackjack:  $$P_{\text{both}} = P_\text{blackjack} \times \frac{3 \times 15} {\binom {50} {2}}.$$  By the inclusion/exclusion principle, the probability of at least one getting blackjack is the sum of probabilities of each individual getting blackjack minus the probability of both getting blackjack (removes redundant overlap):  $$P_\text{either or both} = 2 P_\text{blackjack} - P_\text{both}$$  and the final result (neither gets blackjack) is just the inverse probability:
$$1 - P_\text{either or both} = 0.90524.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 5 '17 at 20:47             answered Jan 5 '17 at 20:41       nclark   166 6              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Dealer had 9 and I was dealt 2 8s. I split the 8s and was given a third card. It was an 8 so I split them again. The next card I was dealt was a fourth 8. This has happened to me three other times in my life, so no big deal. The fifth card was again an 8 and the sixth consecutive 8 followed. No one at the table or the dealer or even the pit boss had ever seen that before. I do not even know how to start calculating what the odds are in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe, which holds 416 cards. Can you help me?    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 7 '14 at 2:44      user940        asked Oct 6 '14 at 21:13       Bill Zeoli   86 1 3              8      I also wanted to add that having six $8$'s against a dealer's $9$ is not an envious position. :) – symmetricuser  Oct 6 '14 at 21:39        1      So how did the hand go?

That is, sure - the probability is very low, but what you really want to know is how likely this is to occur during some larger stretch of unknown size. You would have been just as surprised had this happened on the succeeding hand. – Christofer Ohlsson  Oct 7 '14 at 8:35        1      Given that about 1/3 of the deck has the value of "10" in blackjack, (bad) players splitting their hands 5 times isn't that uncommon.  The pit boss was probably lying when he said he has never seen it before (it is their job to make you feel lucky).  Sorry dude.  But splitting a non-10 hand that many times may be as rare as the casino suggested. – DanielV  Oct 9 '14 at 3:36        |  show 1 more comment          5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  14  down vote      We can assume that the dealer's hole card is irrelevant. So we are looking for the probability that the first six cards are $8$ out of the $415$ cards left in the deck (excluding the dealer's up-card $9$). Among the $415$ cards, there are $32$ $8$'s. There are $\binom{32}{6}$ ways of choosing six $8$'s, and there are a total of $\binom{415}{6}$ ways of choosing the first six cards. Hence, the probability is
$$\frac{\binom{32}{6}}{\binom{415}{6}} \approx 1.32\times 10^{-7},$$
which is very very small.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 6 '14 at 21:42             answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:21       symmetricuser   3,396 7 26              1      I think you mean $\frac{32\choose 6}{416\choose 6}\approx 1.3\times 10^{-7}$. If we allow other denominations besides 8, the number grows by a factor accordingly. Compare this with (the reciprocal of) the number of black jack games played / witnessed by the dealer and/or pit boss. – Hagen von Eitzen  Oct 6 '14 at 21:26        1      @HagenvonEitzen, we know one $9$ is exposed because of the dealer's up-card – symmetricuser  Oct 6 '14 at 21:35            I also said six cards, and then put $8$ in the binomial coefficients for some reason, so I edited those to $6$. – symmetricuser  Oct 6 '14 at 21:37            Great calculus, but have to take into account the 13 denominations. – Albert Masclans  May 12 '15 at 7:15        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      In 8 decks there are 32 8s.  To pick up six of them there are $\binom{32}{6}=906,192$ possible ways for that to happen.  There are, similarly, $\binom{416}{6}=6,942,219,827,088$ ways to get just any six cards.  Dividing these, that's about a 1 in 7.6 million chance for this to happen.  This is about 1/12 as likely as drawing a royal flush on five cards in a single deck.  Of course, you asked about six of any card, which is considerably easier (13 times more common than above), somewhat more likely than a royal flush.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:27       Dan Uznanski   5,754 2 10 26              2      "6,942,219,827,088 ways to get just any six cards" -- only 6,842,091,656,505 because there's a card showing.

So a probability of drawing each Eight in sequence is:  $$\underbrace{\frac{32}{416} \times \frac{31}{415} \times \dots \frac{28}{412} \times \frac{27}{411}}_{\text{6 draws}}$$  If you take into account that the dealer doesn't draw an Eight, then you have $415$ cards to choose from, so a more accurate probability is:  $$\frac{32}{415} \times \frac{31}{414} \times \dots \frac{28}{411} \times \frac{27}{410}$$  Since there are 13 possible cards that can be drawn in sequence, the answer to   what the odds are in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe   is  $$13 \times \frac{32}{415} \times \frac{31}{414} \times \dots \frac{28}{411} \times \frac{27}{410}$$  which is about $1$ in every $580,798$ attempts.

You know that at least one of the 13 will be affected by his downcard as well.  And we still haven't taken into account the rules of blackjack which influence the tendency of the dealer to reshuffle decks in certain situations.  That is why "the" probability only exists in math classrooms, but for engineers and game players, there are many probabilities of progressively more accuracy. – DanielV  Oct 7 '14 at 4:26            No, you don't have to consider his downcard, because you don't know what it is, just like you don't know what the last card in the deck is. Probabilities are a function of known information. What you're trying to do is take it much further than what I wrote in an attempt to avoid its validity. The simple fact is that you took the up card into account to reduce 416 to 415, but not to reduce 13 to 12.8125, and that's simply a mistake. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 5:27        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Clarification: I have interpreted the phrase "what are the odds in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe"
 as asking for the chance that there are  6 straight cards of the same denomination from 
an 8 deck shoe. My answer addresses this interpretation only.   Ignoring the details of the game, I'll just consider the 
chance that  a  well-shuffled 8-deck shoe has  6 or more  eights in a row
somewhere.  I solved a similar problem here.  For your problem,  put $b=384$ and $w=32$ in my answer above to 
arrive at  \begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}(\mbox{at least 6 eights in a row})
&=&{378917534435104330038751954618647 
\over 7539892080833060495675366062952229323}\\[5pt]
&=&0.000050255,\end{eqnarray*}
 or about 1 in 20,000.  If you ask for the probability of at least 6 in 
a row of any of the 13 possible values, an approximate answer is to 
multiply the above by 13, giving $P\approx .0006533$
or about 1 in 1350. Not a common occurrence, but 
 not that rare!     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ♦   1        answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:55      user940              1      Your calculations address a different question than the one posted above. – Mico  Oct 7 '14 at 0:04            My calculations address this question, taken directly from the original post: "what the odds are in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe, which holds 416 cards." – user940  Oct 7 '14 at 0:20            This obviously doesn't answer the same question, because the OP is interested in the odds of drawing 6 of the same card, not the odds that there are 6 of the same card in a row somewhere in the shoe. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 2:42            @JimBalter Are you saying that in blackjack you are always dealt the top cards off the shoe?

In any case, a run elsewhere in the shoe could go to another player, or get split between players, or never get dealt ... it obviously isn't what the OP is asking about. The OP asked " odds are in getting 6 straight cards" -- "in getting" means being dealt 6 such cards in the manner that happened to the OP, not just having those cards in the shoe somewhere. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 3:03         |  show 4 more comments            up vote  0  down vote      Calculations from symmetricuser were all perfect when trying to calculate the probability of taking, for example, 6 8's in a row.

Blackjack Probability Odds  Blackjack odds are percentage figures which represent your probability of losing or winning a hand. They can also represent the house edge or their profit margins as well. Usually probability odds don't mean much on the short term, but they clearly average out in the long term and this is why the casinos always win over the long term.  We decided to make a few tables and charts of the most common blackjack probability odds for various scenarios and situations found while playing blackjack. The most important odds percentage represents the dealer's edge in the game. This is the long term advantage that they have which will eventually take your money away. Blackjack is actually one of the most popular games in the casino and also has some of the lowest odds of all the casino games, except casino craps of course. Generally their edge ranges from 1% to 15% depending on what variation of blackjack you are playing.  How to Beat the Casino House Odds  There is one feature that makes blackjack more desirable than any other casino game. There is actually a way to beat the house edge by increasing your odds. In fact, your probability odds in blackjack can be increase to the point where you would actually be making the profit in the long term, essentially turning the casino into a personal ATM. This practice is known as card counting and casinos don't like this because they know they will be losing money.  Before you start card counting, you should learn "blackjack basic strategy", which is the mathematically correct way to play every move in blackjack to get the best odds. This can lower the house edge to less than 1 percent. When that percentage goes to a negative number such as -1%, then it is you who has the edge over the casino. This is when you complement basic strategy with card counting to get the highest efficiencies.  Odds vs. Dealer Up Card  The first odds chart shows what kind of advantage the player has vs. the dealer based on what his up card is showing. The first column in the chart is what card the dealer has showing after the cards have been dealt. The second column of the table shows the dealer's probability of going bust based on each card. The last column shows the advantage the player has and the probability of winning based on the basic strategy theory. As you can see, the dealer has about a 43% chance of going bust when he has a 5 showing as an up card. At the same time, the player has about 23% advantage as well. Notice that the player advantage goes negative when the 10 cards and ace start showing up. This means the player is more likely to lose.     Dealer's Up Card  Dealer Odds of Busting  Player Advantage Percentage      2  35.30%  9.8%    3  37.56%  13.4%    4  40.28%  18.0%    5  42.89%  23.2%    6  42.08%  23.9%    7  25.99%  14.3%    8  23.86%  5.4%    9  23.34%  -4.3%    10  21.43%  -16.9%    J  21.43%  -16.9%    Q  21.43%  -16.9%    K  21.43%  -16.9%    A  11.65%  -16.0%     Blackjack odds of Busting While Taking a Hit  This chart shows the probabilities of going bust after taking a hit. Busting means that your card total would go over 21 points and would be a hard total as well. The highest score you can get when being initially dealt two cards is 21 points so you can never go bust. This means if you took a hit on a hard 21, you would have a 100% probablity of going bust, which is common sense. Also, if you have 11 points or less, it is impossible to go over 21 points on the next hit and your odds of going bust would be 0 percent.     Total Hand Value  Probability of Going Bust      21  100%    20  92%    19  85%    18  77%    17  69%    16  62%    15  58%    14  56%    13  39%    12  31%    11 or less  0%     House Advantage with Multiple Number of Decks  The number of 52 card decks in a game of blackjack influences the house edge. In some cases, the odds increase in favor of the casino when more decks are used. The advantage edge can be as much as 1% towards the casino and this is a big number in terms of odds over the long term. As you can see here, a single deck of card gives the lowest edge for the casino and gives the player better odds. Multiple decks such as eight decks increases the house edge almost 18 times more than it would for the single deck!     Number of Decks  House Odds Advantage      Single Deck  0.04%    Double Deck  0.42%    Four Decks  0.61%    Six Decks  0.67%    Eight Decks  0.70%      Two Card Frequency Odds  The next odds table deals with the first two cards being dealt or the 2 card frequency odds. Every player is dealt two cards at the beginning of a round of blackjack so this chart tells you the percentage of getting different categories of hands. A natural blackjack is only 4.8%, which essentially is an ace dealt with a ten card straight off the initial deal. Normally the odds are 3 to 2 and you would win $3 for every $2 wagered. It's a small percentage but it's the most desirable hand to get. The lowest hand you can get is two points (two aces). This is part of the decision hands group where players are usually dealt soft hands and can make decisions without going bust. This group is the most common.  The other category is the hard standing hands. These hands are somewhat desirable because of the high scores likely to beat the dealer. These are the second most frequent two card blackjack hands. Finally there is a no bust two card hand. No bust means any two card hand that won't bust on the next hit, such as any soft hand or hard hand that is 11 points or less.     Two Card Combination  Frequency Percentage      Natural 21 Blackjack  4.8%    Hard Standing (17 - 20)  30.0%    Decision Hands (2-16)  38.7%    No Bust  26.5%    Total (all two card hands)  100%     Probability Edge for Each Card Removed from Deck  The next table shows how much your odds improve after when certain cards have been dealt and removed from the deck. Certain cards taken out of the deck and increase or decrease your blackjack odds percentage and the house edge.  This is very important for card counting. If you want the absolute perfect odds in card counting, you have to acount for each small change in the odds whenever a card is dealt. As you can see from the table, when small cards are taken out of play, the odds increase in your favor overall. This is a paramount property of card counting. The opposite happens when large cards are dealt. Your odds begin to decrease. When you are counting cards, you will notice your count decreasing when large cards are dealt.  You can imagine how complicated it would be to be adding these numbers in your head while card counting at the same time. If your mind was a computer, it would be easier to keep track of the percentage. Some people can do this, and this is the way to become a perfect card counter! It is easier to keep track of the odds when playing with a single blackjack deck. For example, when five cards are seen on the table, they offer a 0.67% increase in your advantage. In fact, when a lot of fives are used up, your odds will be much higher than if any of the other low cards were used up, even the six point cards. Also, these effects are cumulative so you always need to keep track of the odds after every card is dealt. This data is actually quite amazing!     Removed Card  Effect on Odds      2  0.40%    3  0.43%    4  0.52%    5  0.67%    6  0.45%    7  0.30%    8  0.01%    9  -0.15%    10  -0.51%    Jack  -0.51%    Queen  -0.51%    King  -0.51%    Ace  -0.59%     Dealer Final Hand Probability Odds  This next table shows the odds of what the dealer's final hand will be. Usually in blackjack, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. These rules are slightly different for other variations of twenty-one. So generally, the odds of the dealer's final score being 16 are 0% because he must hit. This table will show the probability of the dealer busting or getting a non-bust hand as well as natural blackjacks.

View Desktop Version                Blackjack    Blackjack (also known as twenty-one or sometimes pontoon) is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. The name blackjack comes from the fact that when blackjack was first introduced in the U.S. it wasn't very popular, so casinos and gambling houses tried offering different bonus payoffs. One of those was a 10-to-1 payoff for a hand consisting of the ace of spades and a black jack (that is, the jack of spades or the jack of clubs). With the current rules, a blackjack hand doesn't even need to contain a jack.  Rules  A blackjack game has a dealer and one or more players. Each player plays against the dealer. All players are initially dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face down and one face up (these are called the hole card and up card respectively).  Each player can then hit (ask for an additional card) until her total exceeds 21 (this is called busting) or she decides to stand (stop taking cards for the rest of the hand). Face cards count as 10 and an ace may be counted as 1 or 11.  After all of the players have finished, the dealer reveals the hole card and plays the hand with a fixed strategy: hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.  The player loses if she busts and wins if she does not bust and the dealer does (observe that if both the player and the dealer bust, the player loses).  Otherwise, the player wins if her total is closer to 21 than the dealer's. If the player wins, she gets twice her bet; if she loses, she loses her money. If the dealer and player tie it is called a "push;" the player keeps her bet but does not earn any additional money.  If the player's first two cards total 21, this is a blackjack and she wins 1.5 times her bet (unless the dealer also has a blackjack, in which case a tie results), so she gets back 2.5 times her bet.   Soft Hand. A hand that contains an ace that can be counted as 11 is called a soft hand, since one cannot
bust by taking a card. With soft hands, the basic strategy is to always hit 17 or less and even hit 18 if the dealer's up card is 9 or 10 (where the 10 refers to a 10, J, Q, or K).   Doubling down. After the player is dealt her initial two cards she has the option of doubling her bet and asking for one additional card (which is dealt face down). The player may not hit beyond this single required card.  With the basic strategy, you should always double with a total of 11, double with 10 unless the dealer's up card is 10 or A, and double with 9 only against a dealer's 2 to 6. (Some casinos only allow doubling down on 11).   Splitting pairs. At the beginning of a hand, if the player has two cards with the same number (that is, a pair) she has the option of splitting the pair and playing two hands. In principle, a pair of aces should of course be split, but in this case blackjack rules allow you to get only one card on each hand, and getting a 10 does not make a blackjack. With the basic strategy, you should never split 10's, 5's or 4's, always split 8's, and, in the other cases, split against an up card of 2 to 7, but not otherwise.  Strategies for the Player  Blackjack is almost always disadvantageous for the player, meaning that no strategy yields a positive expected payoff for the player.  In the long run, whatever you do, you will on average lose money. Exceptions exist: some casinos offer special rules that allow a player using the right strategy to have a positive expected payoff; such casinos are counting on the players making mistakes.  The so called basic strategy is based on the player's point total and the dealer's visible card. It consists of a table that describes what you should do in any situation in the game (you can find an example of this table at Wikipedia ). Under the most favorable set of rules, the house advantage against a player using the basic strategy can be as low as 0.16%.  Many people assume that the best strategy for the player is to mimic the dealer. A second conservative strategy is called never bust: hit 11 or less, stand on 12 or more. Each of these strategies leads to a player disadvantage of about 6%.  Beat the Dealer What does it mean to have a 0.16% disadvantage? When discussing casino games, one usually finds statements such as the ones above saying something like: "the house advantage in this game is about 0.16%". A first explanation is the following: betting ten dollars each hand, you will in the long run lose an average of 1.6 cents per hand.  It would be nice to have an idea of the probability of winning any particular bet when playing some specific strategy. Indeed, we can infer this from the player's disadvantage. Let's take, as an example, the potential 0.16% disadvantage when playing the basic strategy. Suppose you bet $1 at each of 10,000 bets playing the basic strategy. Let's call p the total probability of winning a pass line bet (so p is the number we are trying to calculate). If p was, for example, 0.5, it would mean that, on average, half the times you should win the bet, so you would win 0.5 · 10,0000 = 5,000 times.  Since each time you win a bet you get twice what you bet and each time you lose the bet you lose all the money, you would end up with 5,000 · $2 = $10,000, that is, the same total amount
you bet (10,000 times $1). In this case, the house advantage is 0%, as is the player advantage. The same idea applies for any p: if you bet 10,000, you should, on average, win the bet 10,000p times, so your average payoff is $20,000p. In our case, the house advantage is 0.16%, so if you play $10,000, on average you end up with $10,000 - $10,000 · 0.0016 = $10,000 - $16 = $9,984. So we only have to solve the equation $20,000p = $9,984 to get p = 0.4992. Links You can find more information on blackjack's rules, strategies, and history on the Internet. For instance, you can try Wikipedia. A very interesting free on-line blackjack trainer can be found here.    Problems    If you are dealt a point total of 16, what is the probability of busting if you hit, assuming that a whole deck will be used to choose among when you are dealt your next card?  If you are dealt a 3 and an ace, what is the probability of not busting if you hit, assuming that a whole deck will be used to choose among when you are dealt your next card?  Suppose you are the only player against the dealer, and you are in the first hand of a game played with one deck. You are dealt an 8 and a 6, while the dealer is showing a queen. What is the probability that you bust if you decide to hit?

      first present the probabilities attached to card dealing and initial
      predictions. In making this calculus, circumstantial information such as
      fraudulent dealing is not taken into account (as in all situations
      corresponding to card games). All probabilities are calculated for cases
      using one or two decks of cards. Let us look at the probabilities for a
      favorable initial hand (the first two cards dealt) to be achieved. The
      total number of possible combinations for each of the two cards is C(52,
      2) = 1326, for the 1-deck game and C(104, 2)=5356  for the 2-deck game.  Probability of obtaining a natural 
		blackjack is  P  = 8/663 = 1.20663%  in
      the case of a 1-deck game and  P
      = 16/1339 = 1.19492%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.   Probability
      of obtaining a blackjack from the first two cards is  P  = 32/663 = 4.82654%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P = 64/1339= 4.77968%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.     Similarly,
      we can calculate the following probabilities:  Probability
      of obtaining 20 points from the first two cards is  P = 68/663 = 10.25641%  in
      the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 140/1339 = 10.45556%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.    Probability
      of obtaining 19 points from the first two cards is  P = 40/663 = 6.03318%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P = 80/1339 = 5.97460%  in the case of a 2-deck game.    Probability
      of obtaining 18 points from the first two cards is  P  = 43/663 = 6.48567%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 87/1339 = 6.4973%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.    Probability
      of getting 17 points from the first two cards is  P  = 16/221 = 7.23981%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 96/1339 = 7.16952%  in the case of a 2-deck game.    A good initial hand (which you can stay with) could be a blackjack or
      a hand of 20, 19 or 18 points. The probability of obtaining such a hand is
      calculated by totaling the corresponding probabilities calculated
      above:  P = 32/663 + 68/663 + 40/663 + 43/663 = 183/663, in the case
      of a 1-deck game and  P = 64/1339 + 140/1339 + 80/1339 + 87/1339 =
      371/1339, in the case of a 2-deck game.  Probability
      of obtaining a good initial hand is  P  = 183/663 = 27.60180%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 371/1339 = 27.70724%  in the case of a 2-deck game.     The
      probabilities of events predicted during the game are calculated on the
      basis of the played cards (the cards showing) from a certain moment. This
      requires counting certain favorable cards showing for the dealer and for
      the other players, as well as in your own hand. Any 
		blackjack strategy is
      based on counting the cards played. Unlike a baccarat game, where a
      maximum of three cards are played for each player, at blackjack many cards
      could be played at a certain moment, especially when many players are at
      the table. T hus, both following and memorizing certain cards require some
      ability and prior training on the player’s part. Card counting techniques 
		cannot however be applied in  online blackjack .  The
      formula of probability for obtaining a certain favorable value is similar
      to that for baccarat and depends on the number of decks of cards used. If
      we denote by x a favorable value, by nx the number of cards
      showing with the value x (from your hand, the hands of the other
      players and the face up card in the dealer’s hand) and by nv the
      total number of cards showing, then the probability of the next card from
      the deck (the one you receive if you ask for an additional card) having
      the value x is:      This
      formula holds for the case of a 1-deck game. In the case of a 2-deck game,
      the probability is:   Generally
      speaking, if playing with m decks, the probability of obtaining a
      card with the value x is:       Example
      of application of the formula: Assume play with one deck, you
      are the only player at table, you hold Q , 2, 4, A (total
      value 17) and the face up card of the dealer is a 4. Let us calculate the
      probability of achieving 21 points (receiving a 4).  We
      have  nx = 2, nv = 5, so:   .  For
      the probability of achieving 20 points (receiving a 3), we have  nx = 0, nv = 5, so:   .  For
      the probability of achieving 19 points (receiving a 2), we have  nx = 1, nv = 5, so:   .  If
      we want to calculate the probability of achieving 19, 20 or 21 points, all
      we must do is total the three probabilities just calculated. We obtain  P = 9/47 = 19.14893%.  Unlike
      in baccarat, where fewer cards are played, the number of players is
      constant (two), and the number of gaming situations is very limited, in blackjack, the number of possible playing configurations is in the
      thousands and, as a practical matter, cannot be entirely covered by tables
      of values.       Sources     A big part of the gaming situations that require a decision, where the
      total value held is 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 points, is comprised in

Blackjack, however, is one of the only casino games where you as a player have a fair shot against the house. This is because blackjack depends on strategizing based on probability instead of pure luck. To increase your chances of winning at blackjack, first learn the basic strategies of playing your cards wisely and then master a card counting system.         Steps   Learning Blackjack Strategies    Blackjack Rules  Blackjack Cheat Sheet  Blackjack Chart        Part 1   Learning from Scratch          1   Memorize the basic terms of the game. The game itself is simple enough to figure out. Every player knows they need to get to 21 to beat the dealer. However, many players don’t understand the terms used beyond hitting to get another card or staying to end their term. Before you play, know about asking to double down, split your hand, or surrender your hand so you can incorporate these into your betting strategies and give yourself the best chance of winning. [1]   When you choose to double down, you double your bet and receive only one more card.  When you have two of the same card, such as a pair of twos, you can split them and play them as two hands with two separate bets.  Very few casinos allow you to surrender your hand. When you have a bad hand, you can surrender and save half your bet.           2   Mitigate the house advantage. The dealer gains an advantage because the player must act first without knowing what the hole card, the face-down card, is. Also, once you go over 21, or bust, you lose even if the dealer busts as well. Once you understand this, you’ll realize that winning depends upon reacting to the cards you have as well as those other players and the dealer show on the table in order to predict what card the dealer has face-down.         3   Study basic blackjack strategy. Because blackjack is a game of probabilities compared to other casino games, you will be a stronger player by learning how to play certain hands. For example, do you hit on your 16 when the dealer has a ten? Do you split your eights? Study a chart to determine which choice you should make depending on what cards you have and what card the dealer shows. [2]   At first you’ll find it hard to remember how to act during various in-game scenarios, but the more you play, the more you’ll learn how to play your hand by instinct.           4   Find out the table’s game rules before you start playing. Different casinos or blackjack games feature different rules. Many games use multiple decks of cards in order to discourage card counting, throwing off your ability to track your odds of winning. Most games of blackjack require the dealer to stop at 17, even if this means the dealer loses, but the rules may allow for the dealer to hit on a soft 17, which is a 17 made with an ace (the ace can be a one or an 11). [3]   A game that makes it harder for you to win in the long term, such as one that allows the dealer to hit on a soft 17, should be avoided. [4]   Avoid continuous shuffle machines when playing in person. These machines make keeping track of possible cards you and the dealer can draw an impossibility.           5   Check the table’s blackjack rules. Before you start playing at a table, it’s important to find out how you will be paid for a blackjack. If you get a natural blackjack, a 21 on the first two cards dealt to you, a table may pay you 3:2, which is $3 for every $2 wagered. Others will pay you less, such as 6:5, and should be avoided. [5]   6:5 odds are worse for you than 3:2. Consider that if you bet and win twice on the first odds, you’ll bet ten units to win 12 units. 12 units on the second odds makes for four bets totalling eight units bet to win 12 units. [6]            6   Formulate your betting strategy. In an average game, it’s best to be consistent or, at most, increase your bet by one dollar or other unit of measurement until you win. Remember that there is no such thing as being due for a win or hot and cold decks. Any such pattern you perceive will disappear over time because the game is based on chance and probability. Instead, try betting low after a loss or deck shuffle and increase your bet a little when you perceive the odds are in your favor.         7   Increase your bet when the odds are in your favor. Many high cards in the deck work better for you since they always amount to ten and help you get more blackjacks. The more you play, the more you’ll gain a sense of how many helpful cards remain in the deck and how to proceed with the hand you have. Once you have a grasp of your odds of winning, you can more aggressively bet on good hands.         8   Resist buying insurance. The dealer will give you an option to buy protection in case the dealer has a blackjack. This means you in essence make a side bet that the dealer will have blackjack. If the dealer does have blackjack, you will win your side bet but lose your original bet. This may get you back some money in the short-term, but long-term the bet makes the casino money. [7]   Beginner players have no way of knowing if the dealer has a card worth ten points face-down under an ace. Card counters however have a better idea and can use their information to make money on this bet.                 Part 2   Counting Cards          1   Assign values to cards. Under the Hi-Lo method of card counting, each numbered card has a value. Cards two through six are worth one point. Cards seven through nine are worth zero points. The ten card, face cards, and the aces are worth negative one point each. [8]   The idea is that you’ll keep a total value of all the cards on display, and as more face cards are left in the deck you’ll make more blackjacks while the dealer busts more.  The Hi-Lo method is a common counting system, but other systems exist that give different point values to certain cards such as aces and fives.           2   Practice keeping a running count. Use a single deck of cards. Turn over the cards one by one, adding up the values as you go. If you draw a two, a five, and an ace, you’ll have a value of one. When you reach the end of the deck, your running total should equal zero. Repeat practice until you’re able to keep your total quickly and quietly.         3   Keep a true count. Casinos are wise to card counters, so they play blackjack with multiple decks at the same time. The true count takes the running count and divides it by the number of decks in play. This count gives you more of an idea of how much of an advantage you have in betting.  A running count of three is fine in a one-deck game, but this number means less when there are multiple decks since there are more cards to factor that reduce your chances of winning.  For example, a seven running count divided by two decks leaves you with a true count of about three. But if there are six decks in play, the true count is only about one.           4   Practice maintaining true counts. Start off by using a few decks. Flip over the cards one by one and grow accustomed to dividing with fractions. At first you can simply round the division into a general true count, but as you go you’ll become more able to perform more accurate divisions in your head with less effort.  An online card counting simulator can help you practice. Some simulators can correct your counting mistakes and track your winnings.           5   Keep a count with distractions. Once you feel comfortable keeping a true count, try mimicking the feel of a casino. First, start small. Add a little music or radio chatter. As you grow more capable, bring in a friend, roommate, or partner. Later on you can practice during loud events such as parties. Eventually you’ll be able to carry on conversations while calculating the true count in your mind. [9]          6   Adjust your betting. When you put your calculations to practice, raise the amount you bet when the count is high in the positives. Remember to remain inconspicuous. Remain natural, talking to other players and the dealer rather than muttering to yourself. Raise your bet by small amounts when you can and lower your bets when you lose. Instead of sitting around at a table for hours, leave when your winning begins to attract suspicion. [10]   Card counting is legal but casinos frown upon it because it costs them money.               Community Q&A      Search    Add New Question      In Vietnam, blackjack cards are counted as: Ace = 1 or 11, two through ten worth their number, and face cards all worth 10.

Blackjack Odds  Blackjack Probability and Blackjack Odds  To fully understand the game of blackjack, you must understand and master blackjack odds. It's crucial to know how the casino gains its edge and how it helps them win. It's also important to understand blackjack odds such as the odds of hitting a 10 or the odds of being dealt a blackjack. You can read over these blackjack odds charts to help understand the logistics behind blackjack. Casino and Dealer Advantage in Blackjack  In most casino games of blackjack, the house advantage (the dealer advantage) is ~ 8%. The house gets this advantage by the dealer being the last player to act. By acting last, all other players have already made their decisions and could quite possibly bust before the dealer has his turn.  By using correct blackjack basic strategy, you can turn the casino edge in blackjack from 7%-8% down to 0.5%. If you correctly use advanced card counting techniques, you can often change blackjack odds and give yourself the advantage over the casino. Manipulating the house odds to your favor is the reason most casinos don't allow card counters to play blackjack.  Probability of Busting on a Hit  It's very important to know the probability of your hand busting when you are holding any total in the game of blackjack. The following odds chart shows the blackjack odds of busting, depending on your current hand value:     Hand Value  % Bust If You Hit      21  100%    20  92%    19  85%    18  77%    17  69%    16  62%    15  58%    14  56%    13  39%    12  31%    11 or Less  0%     Two-Card Count Frequencies  This interesting blackjack odds chart is the two card count frequency chart. This chart shows the percentage chance that you will be dealt a hand in each given value range. The most important frequencey to note is the chance of being dealt a natural blackjack (natural 21 value. The odds of being dealt a natural blackjack are merely 4.8%. Following this chart you will see that the most common two card hand, at 38.7%, is a hand totaling 1-16, which is considered a decision hand.     Two Card Count  % Frequency      Natural 21  4.8%    Hard Standing (17-20)  30.0 %    Decision Hands (1-16)  38.7%    No Bust  26.5%    TOTAL  100.0%     Dealer Final Hand Probabilities  This blackjack odds chart shows the dealer final hand probability. These are the percentages that the dealer will end up with a hand totaling each corresponding value (up to 16). Read over this chart to understand the odds that the dealer has to make his final hand.     Dealer Final Hand Value  %  Cumulative % Total      Natural 21  4.82%  4.83%    21 (3 or More Cards)  7.36%  12.19%    20  17.58%  29.77%    19  13.48%  43.25%    18  13.81%  57.06%    17  14.58%  71.64%    16  28.36%  100.00%     Player Advantage vs. Dealer Up Card  The first two columns in this odds chart explain the dealer's chance of busting, depending on the up card that he is showing. You should note that the dealer has the highest chance of busting when he is showing a 5. The third column in this chart shows the player advantage of using basic strategy, compared to each up card the dealer is showing. You can see that the player has the highest advantage of 23.9%, when the dealer is showing a 5. When the dealer is showing any card that is 9 value or higher, the player is in the negative advantage range.     Dealer Up Card  Dealer Bust %  Player Advantage % with Basic Strategy      2  35.30%  9.8%    3  37.56%  13.4%    4  40.28%  18.0%    5  42.89%  23.2%    6  42.08%  23.9%    7  25.99%  14.3%    8  23.86%  5.4%    9  23.34%  -4.3%    J,Q,K  21.43%  -16.9%    A  11.65%  -16.0%     Effects of Removing Cards from a Deck  When looking at the odds of removing certain cards from a 52-card deck, some cards have a much greater effect on blackjack odds. To create the strongest card counting system ever invented, you would have to incorporate all of these slight and subtle differences into the numbers to be a completely accurate system.  Removing every 5 from a deck cards would make the largest impact of improving your blackjack odds, as a player. On the other hand, removing every Ace from a deck of cards would make the largest impact on improving the odds for the casino.

Is it even possible?  Kevin   This is a typical question one might encounter in an introductory statistics class. Because the sum of a large number of random variables always will approach a bell curve we can use the central limit theorem to get at the answer. From my section on the house edge we find the standard deviation in blackjack to be 1.17. You won't understand this if you haven't studied statistics, but the probability of being at a loss in your example will be the Z statistic of 45000*0.005/(45000 1/2 *1.17) =~ 0.91. Any basic statistics book should have a standard normal table which will give the Z statistic of 0.8186. So the probability of being ahead in your example is about 18%.     I have a few questions regarding blackjack: How often can one expect the dealer to bust and how often can a player expect to win four hands in a row?  John from Westminster, USA   When the dealer stands on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.1% of the time. When the dealer hits on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.6% of the time.  According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of a net win is 42.42%.  However, if we skip ties, the probability is 46.36%.  So, the probability of a four wins in a row is 0.4636 4 = 4.62%.     First of all, I would like to add my name to the growing list of people who love your web site. Your information is quite valuable to both the beginning and expert gambler, and you present your findings in a pleasant, understandable, and even humorous manner. I always check out your site before I head to Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe just to remind me how to play smartly. Anyway, on to my question. Well, more of an observation: when the dealer pulls a 5 on a 16 for their sixth consecutive win, there's always someone who gets up and leaves the table, muttering that the dealer is a mean cruel heartless soul, and goes in search of a "hotter" table. But is there any truth in this? Obviously the dealer is inconsequential to the cards dealt (I like to say the dealer is "simply a messenger of the cards") but are streaks in an 8-deck shoe inevitable, and even predictable? Or is it more like your roulette example, where the odds of each new round are exactly the same? Thanks once again for your web site.  Dave K. from Beverly Hills, California   Thanks for your kind words. Streaks, such as the dealer drawing a 5 to a 16, are inevitable but not predictable. Blackjack is not entirely a game of independent trials like roulette, but the deck is not predisposed to run in streaks. For the non-card counter it may be assumed that the odds are the same in each new round. Putting aside some minor effects of deck composition, the dealer who pulled a 5 to a 16 the last five times in a row would be just as likely to do it the next time as the dealer who had been busting on 16 for several hours.     What are the odds against winning seven hands of blackjack in a row? How about six?  James from Palo Alto, California   According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of an overall win in blackjack is 42.22%, a tie is 8.48%, and a loss is 49.10%. I'm going to assume you wish to ignore ties for purposes of the streak.  In that case, the probability of a win, given a resolved bet, is 46.36%.  The probability of winning n hands is a row is 0.4636 n . So the probability of winning six in a row is 0.99% and seven in a row is 0.46%.     Can it actually be true that what I experience has a statistical base? It seems to me that it takes a lot longer to win X number of chips that to lose the same amount (I only play blackjack). For example, if I start with 300 chips, it might take hours to double my money (my goal), yet I can lost that number in what seems like almost no time at all. Can this really be true? Also, do you have a rule of thumb about when to leave the table when you are winning?  Chris from Gaithersburg, Maryland   What you have experienced is likely the result of some very bad losing streaks. It may also be the result of progressive betting or mistakes in strategy. The basic strategy flat bettor should have a roughly symmetrical expectation in terms of steep ups and downs, slightly favoring steep downs due to the house edge and a 48% chance of a losing hand compared to 43% chance of winning.  If I'm playing for fun then I leave the table when I'm not having fun any longer.     In a six-deck shoe, what is the percentage of times that a blackjack (ace face card or ten) will come up?  Ed from Lynnwood, USA   Let n be the number of decks. The probability of a blackjack is 2*(4/13)*(4n/(52*n-1)). If n=6 the probability is 192/4043 = 4.75%.     Still love your site! I always turn to your site when I'm having questions, most of the time I will find the answer but not always. When playing basic strategy blackjack I understand that I will have ups and downs and over the long run I will roughly break even, my question is what is really "over the long run"? A month, a year, five years? Any ideas?  Kim from Helsinki, Finland   Thanks for the kind words. You ask a good question for which there is no firm answer. It is more a matter of degree, the more you play the more your results will approach the house edge. I recently replaced my blackjack appendix 4 with some information about the standard deviation which may help. For example this table shows that if you play 10,000 hands of blackjack the probability is 90% of finishing within 192 units where you started after subtracting the expected loss due to the house edge. So in 10,000 hands you are likely to win or lose less than 2% of total money bet due to random variation. However if we go up to one million hands the probability is 90% of an 0.2% variation due to luck. In general the variation in the mean is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of hands you play. All of this assumes flat betting, otherwise the math really gets messy.     Please explain how to calculate the probability of a blackjack occurring in a single deck. I can easily work other hands but when a card can be either/or my brain cramps.  Mike from Bossier City, USA   The probability that the first card is an ace is 4/52. The probability that the second card is a 10 point card is 16/51. So the probability of an ace first blackjack is (4/52)*(16/51). Multiply this by 2 because the ten could just as easily be the first card and the answer is 2*(4/52)*(16/51) = 128/2652 = 0.0482655, or about 1 in 20.7 .     Do you have any idea what the "record" is for the most sevens thrown with a pair of fair dice in craps is? I had someone tell me it was 84, but the odds against that many sevens in a row being thrown is so long I'm  skeptical. It seems it's more possible that 84 consecutive passes have come out, but even that's a million to one shot (figuratively--literally, it's much worse). I tried to look on the Web but have no idea where I would find something like that.  Mike   Since this question was submitted, a player held the dice for 154 rolls on May 23, 2009 in Atlantic City.  The probability of this is 1 in  5,590,264,072.  For the probability for any number of throws from 1 to 200, please see my craps survival tables .  For how to solve the problem yourself, see my MathProblems.info site, problem 204.     If I play 100 hands of blackjack at $5 a hand at an 0.5% house edge how much can I lose and still be above three standard deviations south of expectation?  Blair from Christchurch, New Zealand   Your expected loss would be 100*$5*.005=$2.50. The standard deviation of one hand is 1.17, which can be found in my blackjack appendix 7 . So, one standard deviation in your example is $5*1.17*sqr(100)=$58.5. So, the probability of losing $295 or more due to bad luck is .00135 (the Z statistic for -3).     If the first card dealt is an ace what is the probability the dealer will have a blackjack? Assume two decks.  T from Las Vegas, U.S.   There are 103 cards remaining in the two decks and 32 are tens. So the probability of a blackjack is 32/103=31.07%.     What percentage of hands are suited blackjacks? Six-deck shoe, any suit.  RWR from Tuscon, USA   The probability of a suited blackjack in a six-deck game is 2*(4/13)*(6/311) = 0.0118723.     For blackjack, which is the probability to obtain three suited seven in a 6-deck shoe?  Rodrigo from Costa Rica   I attempt to work this out in my blackjack appendix 8 but I’ll work through it more slowly here. We’ll ignore dealer blackjacks to keep things simple and assume the player always hits after two cards. The number of ways to arrange 3 cards in a 6-deck shoe is combin(312,3)=5,013,320. There are 24 sevens in the shoe. The number of ways to arrange 3 sevens out of 24 is combin(24,3)=2024. The probability is the number of winning combinations divided by total combinations, or 2024/5013320=0.0004, or about 1 in 2477.     What piece of information am I missing? If the odds of pulling a ten count card out of a deck is about 30.7% and the odds of pulling out an ace is 7.8% then it seems to me that the combined odds of this happening are about 2.4%. Why do blackjack simulators and blackjack authors state that the odds for a blackjack are 4.7% which happens to twice the calculated odds. What am I missing?  Jeffrey from Loveland   You are forgetting that there are two possible orders, either the ace or the ten can be first. Multiply by 2 and you’ll have your answer.     You go, wiz. Our local casino hands out promotional coupons, which act as a first-card ace in blackjack. From your BJ appendix, most hands containing an ace have a positive expectation, without counting the BJs you’ll get four out of every thirteen plays. Do you know the overall expectation of having an ace as your first card? Thanks.  Victor from Yakima, Washington   According to Stanford Wong’s ’Basic Blackjack’ he says the player’s edge given the first card is an ace is 50.5% (page 124). Your question however could be rephrased as, "what is the value of the ace, given that the other card is not a ten." Using an infinite deck for the sake of simplicity we can breakdown Wong’s number as follows: 0.505 = (4/13)*1.5 + (9/13)*x, where x is what you want to know. Doing some simple algebra we get x=28.5%.     I have just read an article that says it’s proper basic strategy to stand on a multiple card 16, containing a 4 or 5, Vs. a dealer’s 10 in a multiple deck (4 or more decks) blackjack game. I checked your web site and I could only find appendixes for multiple card hands in 1 and 2 deck games. Is this article correct?  Rodney from Clarence, New York   Yes! Good question, even I didn’t know this. The fewer the decks and the greater the number of cards the more this is true. To test the most likely case to favor hitting, 8 decks and only 3 cards, I ran every possible situation through my combinatorial program. The following table displays the results.

The dealer hits on soft 17. I wonder what the odds are of standing on 16 when the dealer’s upcard is 7. It seems only a 10 or face card can beat this and the odds would be in my favor if the dealer draws more than one card. Also, since most strategies are based on millions of calculations done on a computer, I wonder if those of us who will never play a million hands can rely on slight variations like this one. Is this a poor, fair or bad move to make?  Richard S. from Memphis, USA   According to my blackjack appendix 9H the expected return of standing is -0.476476 and of hitting is -0.408624, assuming the 16 is composed of a 10 and 6. So my hitting you will save 6.79 cents for each dollar bet. This is not even a marginal play. There is no sound bite answer to explain why you should hit. These expected values consider all the numerous ways the hand can play out. The best play for a billion hands is the best play for one hand. If you want to deviate from the basic strategy here are some borderline plays: 12 against 3, 12 against 4, 13 against 2, 16 against 10. Deviating on these hands will cost you much less.    My friend and I are debating two blackjack issues that arose from his Caribbean Vacation. (1) What shift in odds does the dealer NOT drawing the second card have? House favor or player favor? (2) in your simulations, what impact does the number of players have on the accuracy of the odds?  Beau from Toronto, Canada   (1) It depends what happens if the dealer does have a blackjack. If the player is guaranteed to lose no more than the original wager then it doesn’t matter if the dealer takes a second card or not. If the player stands to lose the total amount bet after doubling or splitting and the dealer gets a blackjack then that works to the dealer’s advantage. (2) I don’t have to simulate this because the number of players makes no difference.    In blackjack, what is the probability of a blackjack?  Anonymous   It depends on the number of decks. If the number of decks is n then the probability is 2*pr(ace)*pr(10) = 2*(1/13)*(16*n/(52*n-1)), which is conveniently about 1 in 21. 

Here is the exact answer for various numbers of decks.   Probability of Blackjack     Decks  Probability    1  4.827%    2  4.780%    3  4.764%    4  4.757%    5  4.752%    6  4.749%    7  4.747%    8  4.745%        What is the probability that you play ten hands and never obtain a (two-card) 21? Assume the cards are reshuffled after each play?  Matt from Radford, USA   If the probability of a blackjack is p then the probability of not getting any blackjacks in 10 hands is 1-(1-p) 10 . For example in a six deck game the answer would be 1- 0.952511 10 = 0.385251.    What are the odds of getting 3 blackjacks in a row with 1 deck 4 players and one dealer.  Joe P from Parma Heights, USA   I’m going to assume there is never a shuffle between hands. The three other players don’t matter. The answer would be 2 3 *(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47)= 0.00004401, or about 1 in 22722. If there were a shuffle between hands the probability would increase substantially.    In two handed blackjack using one deck, what is the probability of the dealer having a blackjack?  Steve from Solva, United Kingdom   The number of hands doesn’t matter. The probability is 2*(4/13)*(8/103) = 0.0478.    What are the odds of a dealer getting 3 blackjacks in a row on a single deck table with two players?  J.A.S. from Las Vegas, USA   It depends whether there is a shuffle between the blackjacks. Assuming there isn’t the probability would be 8*(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47) = 0.000044011058. The number of other players doesn’t matter, except if they cause a shuffle.    Dear Wizard, I was recently playing blackjack with somewhat of a card-shark who also happens to be my friend. We played casino rules, with one deck- and switched the deal after each time the deck expired. Later, while I was shuffling- I noticed two 9 of spades side by side. My friend obviously claimed he did not know about this, but it seems unlikely. My question is, if you were playing in a similar scenario and were to add one card to the deck, which card would be most advantageous if only you knew about it. Thank you for your time.  Matt   From my blackjack appendix 7 we see that each 9 removed from a single deck game increases the house edge by 0.20%. However if you were going to cheat it would be much better to remove an ace, which increases the house edge by 0.58%. If you were to add a card as the dealer you should add a 5, which increases the house edge by 0.80%. So, the best card for the player is the ace and the best for the dealer is the 5.    I’ve been playing blackjack for quite awhile using basic strategy, mostly betting an even unit each hand. Occasionally I will increase the bet because I "feel" like I am going to win the next one. I would think that just about all recreational players bet on feel once in a while at least. I was reading through some of your past Ask the Wizard columns and saw your calculation of the probability of a string of losses in the August 4, 2002 Column. You know those emotional thoughts that pop in head while gambling (well maybe not your head), "I’m due for a win!" That column seemed to put the mathematics to that "feeling" a player can get. In that columns’ example of a player losing 8 consecutive hands of blackjack the odds were (.5251^8 or about 1 in 173). My question though is what does that really mean? Is it that when I sit down at the table, 1 out of my next 173 playing sessions I can expect to have an 8 hand losing streak? Or does it mean that on any given loss it is a 1 in 173 chance that it was the first of 8 losses coming my way? I know, I know, its some sort of divine intervention betting system I am talking about and no betting system affects the house edge. I’m still curious though. Besides every once in awhile throwing down a bigger bet just adds to the excitement and for some reason it seems logical that if you have lost a string of hands you are "due" for a win.  Steve from Phoenix, AZ   I have no problem with increasing your bet when you get a lucky feeling. What is important is that you play your cards right. Unless you are counting cards you have the free will to bet as much as you want. As I always say all betting systems are equally worthless so flying by the seat of your pants is just as good as flat betting over the long term. When I said the probability of losing 8 hands in a row is 1 in 173 I meant that starting with the next hand the probability of losing 8 in a row is 1 in 173. The chances of 8 losses in a row over a session are greater the longer the session. I hope this answers your question.    Dear wiz, I am a blackjack dealer here in Vegas and the other night dealing, I had 4 out of the 6 ace of spades in my hand. I had A-A-K-A-A-10, so good think is I busted, but quick calculations on the game, we figured getting 4 out of the six aces on one had is around 7mil to 1. Is this number a little high?  Jason   The probability of this occurring in which your other two cards are any two 10-point cards is 4*COMBIN(6,4)*COMBIN(6*16,2)*(4/6)*(3/5)*(1/2)/combin(312,6) 1 in 22,307,231. However there are other ways you get four aces in the same hand, for example the last card might be an 8 or 9. I would have to do a computer simulation to consider all the other combinations. However to make a rough guess I’d say the 7 million looks about right.    After performing my own infinite deck analysis for Blackjack with the same rules as yours (dealer stands all 17s, re-splitting allowed to 4 hands except Aces, which can only be split once, doubling after splitting, draw only one card to split Aces), I came across your site. In comparing expected values, I obtained the same numbers as you in all cases, except for pair splitting, which were slightly different. So I’m wondering how you went about your calculation of expected values for splitting?  Anonymous   It took me years to get the splitting pairs correct myself. Cindy of Gambling Tools was very helpful. Peter Griffin also addresses this topic in chapter 11 of the The Theory of Blackjack Let’s say I want to determine the expected value of splitting eights against a dealer 2. Resplitting up to four hands is allowed. Here is how I did it.   Take a 2 and two 8’s out of the shoe. Determine the probability that the player will not get a third eight on either hand. Go through all ranks, except 8, subtract that card from the deck, play out a hand with that card and an 8, determine the expected value, and multiply by 2. For each rank determine the probability of that rank, given that the probability of another 8 is zero. Take the dot product of the probability and expected value over each rank. Multiply this dot product by the probability from step 2. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 3 hands. Take another 8 out of the deck. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 3 instead of 2. Multiply dot product from step 7 by probability in step 5. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 4 hands. Take two more 8’s out of the shoe. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 4 instead of 2, and this time consider getting an 8 as a third card, corresponding to the situation where the player is forced to stop resplitting. Multiply dot product from step 11 by probability in step 9. Add values from steps 4, 8, and 12. The hardest part of all this is step 3. I have a very ugly subroutine full of long formulas I determine using probability trees. It gets especially ugly when the dealer has a 10 or ace up.    Dear wiz, How do you calculate the probability of getting three sevens, three colored sevens, and three suited sevens in blackjack?  Geoff   Let’s assume six decks of cards and the player always takes a third card (whether by hitting or splitting). The number of ways to draw 3 suited sevens is the number of suits (4) times the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 sevens of that suit in the shoe. In other words 4× combin (6,3)=4×20=80. The number of ways to draw 3 colored sevens, including 3 suited sevens, is the number of colors times the number of ways to pick 3 out of the 12 sevens in the shoe of that color, or 2×combin(12,3)=2×220=440. The number of ways to draw any 3 sevens, including 3 colored and suited sevens, is the number of ways to pick 3 cards out of the 24 sevens in the shoe, or combin(24,3)=2024. The total number of combinations for any 3 cards out of 312 is combin(312,3)=5013320. So the probability of 3 suited sevens is 80/5013320=0.000015957. The probability of three colored, but not suited, sevens is (440-80)/5013320=0.0000718. The probability of three sevens of mixed colors is (2024-440)/5013320= 0.00031596.    Good job and well done. The question: I notice from your May 5, 2003 Column that you actually CALCULATE your blackjack odds. I am a bit surprised that you were not using your computer to SIMULATE the results. Or is this a stupid question, i.e., the computer will take a million years to do the job?  Anonymous   Yes, I calculate blackjack odds using a combinatorial approach, analyzing every possible ways the player and dealer cards can come out, taking the greatest expected value at every decision point. This is harder to program than a simulation but I feel is more elegant and a nice challenge in recursive programming. However I still respect my peers to do simulations. With today’s computers it doesn’t take long to run off a billion bets, which gets very close to the optimal strategy return.    I recently went to Vegas and had an incredible hand of blackjack... received an ace as first card, split, received another ace, split, received a third ace, split, and got one last ace... Then was dealt blackjack on all 4 hands! No lie! 2 of my friends were witnesses, as was the entire Luxor gaming gods...What are the odds on this? It was a 6 card deck shoe, I was sitting in #3 seat of a 4 person game. Assume a fresh shuffle?  Anonymous   Not too many places allow resplitting aces, so be glad you were playing somewhere that did. Your seat position does not matter. The probability of this is the probability that the first four cards out of the shoe are aces, and the next four are tens, or (combin(24,4)/combin(312,4))*(combin(96,4)/combin(308,4)) = 1 in 4,034,213.    I just witnessed a friend get four blackjacks in a row starting with the first hand of a newly shuffled single deck playing head to head against the dealer. I looked at the FAQ’s and saw the odds for getting one blackjack in single deck, but don’t know how to calculate them for getting four in a row off the top. Instead of a decimal probability, could you tell me the odds of this? It must be astronomical. Hope to hear from you.  Anonymous   I seem to get a variation of this question at least once a month. Let’s assume for now the deck is shuffled after every hand, to make the math easier. If the probability of something happening is p then the probability of it happening n times in a row is p n . The probability of a blackjack in a single deck game is 4*16/combin(52,2) = 64/1326. So the probability of four in a row is (64/1326) 4 = 16777216/ 3091534492176 = 1 in 184270. However the actual probability is much less, because as the player gets each blackjack the ratio of aces to cards left in the deck decreases. Without knowing what cards the dealer got I can’t tell you the exact answer.    First I wanted to tell you how much I look at and love your web site, and admire your math skills. I use 6 decks to deal blackjack, and added 3 jokers for reasons I won’t waste your time with but, what are the odds of dealing all 3 jokers to a player right in a row. Thank you very much.  Anonymous   You’re welcome, thanks for you compliments. The probability of being dealt 3 jokers in a row from a six deck shoe (plus the 3 jokers) is 1/combin(315,3) = 1 in 5,159,805. Another solution is (3/315)*(2/314)*(1/313).    Michael, a person asked you if they are not counting cards in blackjack, what difference does it make how many decks are being used. You stated the difference had mostly to do with the number of stiff hands possible, due to the fact that if a small card came out it was more likely a large card would follow and vice-a-versa. How could that be? Would it still not be a random event with the possibility of a small or large card coming out being equal, if you are not counting?  Anonymous   Every legitimate blackjack expert agrees the house edge decreases as the number of decks goes down, all other rules being equal. However it is hard to explain why. First, it is true that you are more likely to get one small card and one big card in single-deck than multiple-deck. For example if we define a small card as 2 through 6, and a large card as any 10-point card or ace then the probability of getting one of each in single deck is 2*(20/52)*(20/51) = 30.17%. The probability in 8-decks is 2*(160/416)*(160/415) = 29.66%. Although stiffs can cut both ways the player has the free will to stand, the dealer must always hit them.    At a single deck game what is the probability all three players and the dealer get a blackjack the first round after a shuffle?  Anonymous   Following are the probabilities: Player 1 0.048265 Player 2 0.036735 Player 3 0.024823 Dealer 0.012560 The product is 1 in 1,808,986.    Mr. Wizard, Great site. There is a lot of useful and interesting info. I’d like to see more of the mathematics and possible sources of simulations (source code, books, etc.) behind the games. Where would you suggest that a person interested in writing something similar to your "blackjack house edge calculator" go for more info? Thank you for your response.  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. I’m afraid I know of no source, including myself, that shows code for game analysis. It took me years to get my blackjack engine to work perfectly (splits when the dealer had a 10 or ace showing was very tricky). An easier way to get the house edge for blackjack is to write a random simulation. One of these days I would like to write a book on how I analyzed the games, but I’m afraid only you would buy it.    What is the probability of a blackjack for n decks?  Anonymous   2*(4/13)*(4n/(52n-1))    I am a blackjack dealer and last night I amazed my table on a single-deck blackjack game (the horrible 6 to 5). My hand consisted of an Ace up, Ace in the hole and then I drew the other 2 Aces and then a 7 for 21! What are the odds of this happening and I am especially interested in knowing the math. Thanks!  Anonymous   The probability is (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49)*(4/48) = 1 in 3,248,700.    In blackjack, what is the probability of the dealer making a stopping hand (17-21) drawing eight cards? This happened to a friend of mine online and I think it's an extremely rare occurrence. How about seven cards? Thanks for the great site and keep up the awesome work!  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. Assuming a six-deck game, where the dealer stands on soft 17, and the player plays basic strategy here are the rounded results based on a 100-million hand simulation.

Also, does increasing the amount available for total wagering increase the likelihood of winning the $200.  Anonymous   If you had a game with no house edge the probability of winning $200 with $5000 to risk, using any system, would be 5000/(5000+200) = 96.15%. The general formula for winning w with a bankroll of b is b/(b+w). So the larger the bankroll the better your chances. The house edge will lower the probability of success by an amount that is hard to quantify. For a low house edge game like blackjack, the reduction in the probability of success will be small. It would take a random simulation to know for sure. Forgive me if I don't bother with that. VegasClick did a small simulation about the probability of success with the Martingale .    As I read your analysis of the Royal Match side bet in blackjack , am I correct that your odds are for the first hand of the shoe? If so, wouldn’t the real-world odds of an easy match be tilted a bit more toward the player? It seems to me that if the suits get unbalanced in any direction it would slightly lessen the house edge, and the suits will certainly fluctuate through the shoe.  Frank from Michigan   This is not true.  The remaining deck needs to be exhibit more than a certain degree of skewness for the odds to swing to the player's favor.  Consider a hypothetical side that pays 3 to 1 for any suited pair in a one-deck game.  Of the top of the deck the probability of winning is 4* combin (13,2)/combin(52,2) = 23.53%.  However if you burn two cards of different suits the probability of winning goes down to 2*(combin(13,2)+combin(12,2))/combin(50,2) = 23.51%.  If you burn two cards of the same suit the probability of winning increases to (3*combin(13,2)+combin(11,2))/combin(52,2) = 23.59%. If one card of each rank were removed the probability of winning would go down to 4*combin(12,2)/combin(48,2) = 23.40%.  What all this shows is that if cards are removed at a uniform distribution the odds of winning go down, however at a very skewed distribution the odds go up. As the deck is played down sometimes your odds get better, and sometimes worse, but in the long run they average out and stay at a 23.53% chance of winning.    I have been a dealer for 27 years and have seen a lot.  One of my favorites was a guy who never looked at his cards playing blackjack....just tucked them.  I thought he was nuts of course but some days he won and some days he lost.  Just like most people.  I tried this myself on a free gambling website and won 2 out of 3 times gambling 20 minute sessions.  My question is this:  How much worse off are you doing this than trying to play basic strategy?  I really don’t think it matters much at all what you do in blackjack for the ’average’ player.  Mark from Las Vegas   Under typical Vegas rules (6-deck, dealer hits soft 17) the house edge by always standing is 15.7%.  In the short-run one could still overcome that, but in the long run you’ll lose badly.    I lost a lot of money playing Cryptologic Blackjack today.  While I don’t think anything is fixed, one aspect of my play seemed well outside the range of probability.  Within 35 hands, the dealer showed a 6 seven times and won each time.  This was verified through the logs.  If the probability of a dealer bust is 56% with a six, my calculation suggests the odds of this independent event happening six consecutive times is 0.23%.  Adam from Toronto   At Cryptologic they use 8 decks and the dealer stands on a soft 17.  According to my blackjack appendix 2 , the probability of the dealer busting with a 6 up is 0.422922.  So the probability of not busing is 1 - 0.422922 = 0.577078.  The probability of not busing 7 times out of 7 is (0.577078) 7 = 2.13%.    First off, my apologies if you consider this a basic math question.  I’m a dealer at a Northern Ontario casino, and last night (for the dealer) drew a 12-card 17 (A-A-A-A-A-A-6-A-A-A-A-A).  We use six decks.  Neither my player or I had ever seen this before.  What are the odds of this?  Timothy Rowland from Orilila   Wow!  The probability of this is (combin(24,6)/combin(312,6)) * (24/306) * (combin(18,5)/combin(305,5)) = 1 in 287,209,346,813,617.    I am a pit supervisor at a local casino and recently had a dealer deal two players two seven of clubs each and give himeself the last seven of clubs as his upcard on a five-deck shoe.  What are the odds of five of the same card coming out of a five-deck shoe in order?  Jesse from Scottsdale   That probability would be 52/ combin (260,5) = 5/9525431552 = 1 in 1,905,086,310.    According to standard BJ rules and perfect basic strategy, how many percent of my DOUBLED DOWN hands should I expect to win, push and lose?  Cameron from Melbourne, Australia   Assuming liberal Vegas Strip rules (six decks, dealer stands on soft 17, double after split allowed, late surrender allowed, resplitting aces allowed) the following are the probabilities of each possible outcome when doubling on the initial two cards.  This does not include doubling after splitting.   Win: 54.99% Lose: 38.06% Draw: 6.95%  I’ve played a lot of Blackjack over the years but have never struck anything like the situation I experienced on the weekend.  Playing $25 a hand I lost 19 hands in a row with no pushes.  One of the hands was a double down, so effectively I lost 20 x $25 bets in a row. I was playing strict Basic Strategy for New Zealand conditions (not counting, CSM in use).  Have you ever heard of such a horror streak?  I was ahead about $300 when the sky fell in but stuck to the strategy and eventually left the session $200 ahead and very relieved.  My calculations estimate the probability of 19 straight losses as 1 chance in about 207,000; you may well correct me on this.  I play to a betting progression system, purely for discipline/money management purposes which has me betting 1 unit after every loss.  Had I done anything differently, I would have been cleaned out well before the 19 hands came up.  Ken from Auckland, New Zealand   From my blackjack appendix 4 we see the following probabilities for each initial hand.    Win 42.43% Lose 49.09% Draw 8.48%  So the probability of going exactly 19 losses in a row is 0.4909^19*(1-0.4909) = 1 in 1,459,921.  By way of comparison, the probability of being dealt a royal flush in video poker is 1 in 649,740, or 2.25 times as likely.  Avid video poker players have been known to receive several dealt royals, so if you play a lot of blackjack you’ll likely hit such a losing streak eventually.    I’m totally baffled!  If in an 8-deck or continuous shuffle blackjack game there is no difference in the probabilities of a card appearing at any time, why have you posted Blackjack Appendix #18 ?  If the probabilities say hit on 16 vs. 7 or higher, how can the probabilities change if you have 5 or 6 cards as opposed to 2 cards?  16 is 16 no matter how you construct it, right?  I see the change if the deck is shrinking or in a game like Spanish 21 where there is a bonus for 21 with 5 or more cards, but why in an 8-deck game or continuous shuffle?  Ernie from Toledo   The reason the strategy changes, according to the number of cards in your hand, as shown in appendix 18, is that every card that leaves the deck changes the probabilities of every card left to be played.  A good example is the single-deck basic strategy says to surrender 7,7 against a 10; but for any other 14 you should hit.  The reason you should surrender is half the sevens have already been removed from the deck.  You need another seven to make 21, the only hand that will beat a dealer 20.  So the shortage of sevens lowers the expected value of hitting to under half a bet, making surrender the better play. In an eight-deck shoe there are 416 cards.  That may seem like a lot, but 16 against a 10 is such a borderline hand that removal of just one card can making standing a better play.  The rule is that for eight or fewer decks if your 16 is composed of three or more cards, and the dealer has a 10, then you should stand. In a two-card 16 the average points per card is 8, with a 3-card 16 the average is 5.33.  With more small cards out of the deck in the 3-card hand the remaining deck becomes more large card rich, making hitting more dangerous, swaying the odds in favor of standing.    Hi Wizard.  Thanks for maintaining this web site! I have a question about a blackjack rule that is applied in Dutch casinos: When being dealt a pair of sevens, a third seven will earn you 2:1 on your bet, regardless if you win the hand or not. However, this only applies when the sevens have NOT been split. I know that there are 6 dealer up cards in basic strategy that allow splitting sevens and 7 that do not, so the player should have an edge in this particular situation. But what are the odds of being dealt 3 sevens in blackjack in the first place? And if dealt 3 sevens, what are the odds they qualify for the 2:1 pay-out rule, based on a 4 to 6 decks, dealer stands on soft 17 basic strategy chart? Hope you can figure this one out for me. Keep up the good work!  Stan from The Netherlands, Europe   I show that rule is worth 0.026% to the player.  Despite the incentive to hit 7,7 against a dealer 2-7, the player should still follow basic strategy and split.    I have a friend who starts complaining when his first card is a six, without waiting to see what his second card and the dealer’s up card are.  I think he should wait because he could get a two, three, four, five, etc. (i.e., a decent second card) OR the dealer could show a two through six (a good card for the table).  What do you think?  How much worse are his odds of winning with a first card of six without knowing this second card or the dealer’s up card? Or is my friend just a whiner?  Thank you for your time.  Scott from Long Beach   My blackjack appendix 14 shows that if your first card is a six your expected value is already about −21%.  For example, if he bet $100, a fair price to sell the hand and bet would be about $79. Maybe you can take advantage of his complaining by offering to buy his hand for less than the fair 79 cents on the dollar.  I’d suggest 75 cents on the dollar, to give you an edge, without taking too much advantage.    Bally Gaming has a single-deck, multi-hand, blackjack game.  The player plays seven hands against a single dealer hand.  There is an interesting rule in that if the game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  What is the probability of running out of cards?  Can have suggest any strategy changes to run out the deck?  Michael L. from West Mifflin, PA   For the benefit of other readers, the full set of rules is:   Single deck. Dealer stands on soft 17. Winning blackjack pays even money. Player may double any first two cards. No double after split. Player may resplit to four hands, including aces. No draw to split aces. No surrender. Six-card Charlie (player unbusted six cards automatically wins). Cards shuffled after every hand. If game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  The house edge using total-dependent basic strategy is 2.13%.  I ran a 7-player simulation, using total-dependent basic strategy, and the average number of cards used per round was 21.65, with a standard deviation of 2.72.  In almost 190 million rounds played, the most cards ever used was 42, which happened 7 times. It is my educated opinion that even with computer perfect composition-dependent strategy the player would still realistically never see the last card.  You could cut down the house edge much more using composition-dependent strategy, according to all the cards seen as you go along.  However bucking 2.13% house edge to start with, you’ll never get anywhere near break-even, regardless of how hard you try.    Recently, the Tuscany casino ran a promotion where if you got 30 blackjacks in a 30-day period, you would win a $100 bonus. At first, the minimum bet was $5 to get your card stamped. However, I later heard the minimum for a stamp was raised to $15. I wrote a letter of complaint about it to the casino manager, stating in part:   I just wanted to express my disappointment in this change, if it is true. I never had a chance to take advantage of the promotion and doubt I will be able to now. The amount of time necessary to receive 30 blackjacks (I’m told about 8 hours of continuous play) seems unreasonable at $15/hand when the promotion still offers only $100.  Here is the reply I received:  In response to your e-mail on the blackjack blackout promotion, I’m not sure where you received your information on how long it takes to complete the blackout card. We’ve seen players complete the card in less than four hours. Also, you have thirty days in which to complete the card. I hope you understand this is not a task that is unreachable with that much time. I THANK YOU for your letter. It’s good to hear feedback from our customers. Hope you can give it a try and win some money! What is the probability of getting 30 blackjacks in four hours?  nyuhoosier   According to my game comparison , blackjack players play about 70 hands per hour.  The probability of a blackjack in a six-deck game is 24*96/combin(312,2)=4.75%.  I assume a blackjack tie still gets a stamp.  So it should take about 30/0.0475=632 hands to fill the card, or 9.02 hours. The probability of filling the card in 4 hours, assuming 280 hands, is 1 in 30,000 playing one hand at a time.  I suspect any player achieving the goal in four hours was playing at least two hands at a time. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas .    On a recent Vegas trip I saw the dealer get a 9-card 21.  The rules were six decks and the dealer stood on soft 17.  What are the odds of that?  aceofspades   The probability of the dealer getting exactly a 9-card 21 under those rules is 1 in 32,178,035.

It’s because they often make some or all of the following common mistakes.    MISTAKE 1: NOT CHECKING THE PLAYING RULES  Most players just plop themselves down at the first open blackjack seat that they spot. That is often a big mistake because not all blackjack games are created equal. Some games have a good mix of player-favorable rules, like the dealer stands on soft 17, and you can double down after pair splitting, while others have terrible rules, like a player blackjack pays 6-5, or doubling is restricted to 10 or 11 only.  A casino manager isn’t going to point you to his more player-favorable games. Nope, that’s your responsibility. Therefore, it behooves a player to check the rules before sitting down to play. Is the dealer going to pay you 3-2 on a blackjack? Does the dealer stand or hit on soft 17? Can you double down after pair splitting? Is surrender offered? Playing at a table with horrible rules can doom a player.     MISTAKE 2: NOT USING BASIC STRATEGY  Playing blackjack is not a guessing game, where sometimes you hit your 16 against a dealer’s 10 upcard, and for whatever reason, other times you stand. The mathematically correct way to play every hand has been determined by brilliant mathematicians and this strategy is known as the basic playing strategy. The latter is available in books and on the Internet (including my Ultimate Guide to Blackjack ). The strategy is shown in tables and charts and it tells you the right way to play every hand. So if you hold a 9-9 and the dealer’s upcard is a 9, there is one and only one correct way to play this hand. It doesn’t matter if you are playing in a casino in Las Vegas, the Midwest, Biloxi, or Atlantic City, or whether you just lost or won the last five hands, or whether you have been winning or losing money, or whether your gut is telling you to stand, the correct play is to split. You don’t split sometimes, and stand other times. You always split. You must play like a robot, and always make the correct basic strategy play regardless of everything else. If you can’t or won’t accept this, then you should play a different game because you will never be successful at blackjack.   MISTAKE 3: TRYING TO BEAT THE HOUSE WITH A BETTING PROGRESSION  It seems players have a fascination with betting progressions, where you bet more or less based on the results of previous hands, because they mistakenly believe they can win with them. Well they can’t and they won’t. You are fighting a losing battle if you use a betting progression for one simple reason. In the history of blackjack, there has never been any mathematical study that proves your chances of winning the next hand will improve based on the results (win or lose) of the previous hands. Betting progressions are not the magic bullet that will help you win at blackjack. And yes, in the short run when you get to make some adrenaline-pumping big bets, according to whatever progression you are using, they can be fun to use but in the long run, guess what? The house edge against you won’t change one iota. And what’s worse is you will lose more money using a betting progression in the long haul compared to just betting the same amount on every hand because with a betting progression you will be exposing a greater amount of your bankroll to the house edge, so the more money you bet, the more money you stand to lose. Nope, betting progressions don’t work in the long run so forget about it.  MISTAKE 4: INCREASING YOUR BET BECAUSE YOU ARE DUE TO WIN  Most blackjack players mistakenly believe that blackjack is close to a 50-50 proposition so if they lose several hands in a row, they reason the odds must be better for them to win the next hand so they make a bigger bet.  Remember what I said earlier about past results not affecting future results in blackjack? This holds true even after you’ve had a bad run of losing several consecutive hands. Your chance of winning the next hand in blackjack is about 48% (excluding ties), regardless of what happened in previous hands. The only time you should bet more in blackjack is when you know you have the best of it (i.e., by card counting - check your skills with the card counting trainer ) and not when you think that you are “due to win.”   MISTAKE 5: PLAYING ON A BLACKJACK TABLE THAT USES A CONTINUOUS SHUFFLING MACHINE (CSM)  A CSM is an automatic shuffling device that also dispenses the cards to the dealer to deal to players. Many casinos nowadays use CSMs on their tables because it speeds up the game and it also discourages card counters. A CSM usually contains four or five decks of cards, and after every round, the dealer places the discards back into the CSM where the cards are randomly shuffled. Because a live blackjack dealer never stops dealing to manually shuffle the cards, she can deal more hands per hour to players. This exposes more of a player’s bankroll to the house edge, resulting in an increase in a player’s theoretical hourly loss. Average players need to slow down their play, which they can do by playing on a table where the dealer hand shuffles the cards, rather than on one that uses a CSM.   MISTAKE 6: PLAYING 6-5 GAMES  I casually mentioned this in Mistake #1 but because 6-5 blackjack games are proliferating it bears repeating. When a casino pays 6-5 (or 7-6, or worse, even money) for a blackjack, that’s a horrible game. In a single-deck game, the house edge zooms to 1.39%; if blackjack pays only even money, the house edge increases even more to 2.3%. It’s not only single-deck games that have 6-5 payoffs. Nowadays, you’ll find 6-5 payoffs on double- and multi-deck games. Be especially vigilant about blackjack games in so-called party pits, where blackjack payoffs are usually 6-5 or even money. You’ll pay big time for the eye-candy in party pits. Bottom line: Don’t make the mistake of playing a 6-5 blackjack game. Check the rules posted on the table or ask the dealer. If the game doesn’t pay 3-2 for a blackjack, walk away (better yet, run).   MISTAKE 7: ALWAYS MAKING THE INSURANCE BET  I covered the insurance bet in Chapter 2.6 but it bears repeating that this bet is an unprofitable bet for basic strategy players. Casinos have fooled players into believing this is a good bet because it “insures” or “protects” their main bet from losing against a dealer’s blackjack.  This is far from the truth because the insurance bet neither increases nor decreases your chance of winning the original bet. Plain and simple, the insurance bet is nothing more than a side bet on whether or not the dealer has a ten in the hole (i.e., her downcard) and, consequently, a blackjack. Without any information on the composition of the cards in the deck, you have no earthly idea if the dealer’s downcard is a ten, which is why insurance should never be taken by basic strategy players. Note: Card counters, on the other hand, have information on the composition of the deck; therefore, insurance is a profitable bet for them. I’ll cover this in Chapter 10.  MISTAKE 8: PLAYING TIRED OR INEBRIATED  Have you even seen a bleary-eyed or inebriated blackjack player winning? Neither have I. Yes, I know alcoholic drinks are free when you play, and after a long trip, you can’t wait to get on the blackjack tables.  However, you must have a clear head when you play blackjack because you have to use your brain to make playing decisions. Drinking too much alcohol or playing when tired will just cloud your thinking process, leading to playing mistakes. Play first, drink later: and only play blackjack when you are well rested.

The dealer stands on soft 17. Also, in the event that both dealer and player gets blackjack, it is a push. There is no insurance policy and 21 on both sides are always a tie.  I have 10,000 credits to work with.  With the Martingale betting system , I figured that I am more likely to gain a profit than to lose credits. But I'm not quite sure how to calculate the math behind this and how to calculate the probability for winning a single blackjack hand.  I figured with 10,000 credits, I can start my bet at 1, then go to 2, then 4, etc (doubling my bet everytime I lose). This allows me to lose up to 12 hands before I am bankrupt. On the other hand, if I win any of these 12 hands, I gain profit and just reset my bet to 1 again. The way I see it, I have over a 50% chance to win at least one of these 12 hands, thus always profiting.  Am I favored to gain profit in this specific type of blackjack? How can I calculate the probability for this?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Oct 7 '13 at 21:23       krikara   238 2 6 14                  Eventually you will lose your entire bankroll because it is finite. – Dan Rust  Oct 7 '13 at 21:27             @DanielRust What's the probability of that? – krikara  Oct 7 '13 at 21:36            You could actually play $13$ hands with doubling.

That is, if you play long enough, you will hit the $13$ hand unlucky streak. – Dan Rust  Oct 7 '13 at 21:53         add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote      Whether the game is in your favor is independent of the betting system.  No system of betting can rescue a losing game.  You are correct that with Martingale you are more likely to win than lose a given series, but if the basic bet is losing the losses will be large and probable enough to give a negative expectation.  For your example, if your chance of winning an individual hand is $0.49.0.50,0.51$, your chance of losing $12$ in a row is about $0.000310,0.000244,0.000191$.  If you lose $12$ in a row, you lose $4095$, so the expectation of a series is $-0.268,0,0.215$  You can't calculate the chance of winning a hand until you specify the strategy you will follow. It is still too complicated to compute by hand, so people resort to computer modeling.  You use a random  number generator to deal a lot of hands and count how many you win.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 22 '14 at 15:05      user940        answered Oct 7 '13 at 21:48       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I was recently curious about this betting strategy as well. Instead of trying to figure out the math behind it, I wrote a simple computer program that runs 1000 trials at each permutation of start balance, base wager, and target. The model assumes a coin toss for each trial 50% chance of success (random trial number based on uniform distribution).  The betting strategy doubles your base wager each loss, and returns it to the base wager after each win. The table below shows the frequency of wins (win=reaching target balance without running out of money). To start, I tested identical proportions of parameters to compare results. So far I'm attributing the variance in results to statistical error.  I conclude that you can increase your odds of doubling your money by around 9%. It's somewhat obvious, but you maximize your gain by using the lowest base wager as percentage of start balance. The maximum avg run length was 15 trials, so I'd say this is definitely a feasible betting strategy.  If anyone out there knows how to mathematically model this, I would be happy to test out the mathematical theory and compare against the program.      share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 13 '14 at 1:03       Jonathan   11 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      I 've done the calculation in mathematica (as well as excel to double check).

Typically, if the dealer shows an Ace or 10-value card (10,J,Q,K) the dealer will "peek" at their second card and check for Blackjack. If Blackjack is discovered all players (except those with Blackjack also) will lose immediately and the next round is dealt - this speeds up the game and thus speeds up casino profits.  If the dealer does not peek for Blackjack this calculation is easy:  For example, suppose the dealer shows a 4 and the player shows 2,3. Then the probability our next card will be a 5 is simply 4/49 (4 5's left in 49 remaining cards). The dealer's down-card is equally likely to be any of the 49 remaining cards and thus shouldn't affect the probability at all, we simply ignore it.  However, if the dealer shows a 10 and the player shows 2,3 and the dealer doesn't have Blackjack things are different. Intuitively, because we know the dealer doesn't have an Ace, we should be more likely to receive an Ace (or less likely to receive a non-Ace) - but I'm unsure how to calculate this exactly.

Ignore the irrelevant stuff.  A good starting place with this kind of problem is "can you solve it if there are only 2 cards in the deck?"  "If there are only 3 cards?" – DanielV  Jun 7 '17 at 2:45             What exactly are you trying to calculate?  You mention the probability of an Ace, the probability of a non-Ace, but don't say anything specific.  Also, as noted many casinos use many decks for blackjack to make card counting and rich decks less common.  What assumption would you like to make regarding the number of decks? – Ross Millikan  Jun 7 '17 at 2:53            @DanielWainfleet that's true, i'm assuming a single deck shoe for this problem – Abovestand  Jun 7 '17 at 3:07        |  show 3 more comments          2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted       However, if the dealer shows a 10 and the player shows 2,3 and the dealer doesn't have Blackjack things are different. Intuitively, because we know the dealer doesn't have an Ace, we should be more likely to receive an Ace (or less likely to receive a non-Ace) - but I'm unsure how to calculate this exactly.   You know that four cards are not in the deck 10,2,3, and another non-ace, leaving 48 cards in the deck.  The four aces may be anyhere in the deck with equal probability, so the probability the next card drawn is an ace is $4/48$.  $$\mathsf P(X=A\mid P_1=2, P_2=3, D_1=10, D_2\neq A) = \tfrac 4{48}$$  For other cards we must also consider the probability that it is the dealer's second card.   One of the kings, say, will be the dealer's second card with a probability of $4/(52-3-4)$.  On condition that one is, the probability that one from the other three kings is the next card is $3/48$, and on condition that the dealer's second card also ins't a king, the probability that the next card is one from the four kings is is: $4/48$.   So by total probability, for any from the nine such cards that are not showing (or an ace):  $$\mathsf P(X=K\mid P_1=2, P_2=3, D_1=10, D_2\neq A) ~{ = ~\tfrac 4{45}\tfrac 3{48}+\tfrac{41}{45}\tfrac 4{48} \\[1ex]=~ \dfrac{11}{135}}$$  Similarly, for cards that are showing, such as 2,3,10:  $$\mathsf P(X=2\mid P_1=2, P_2=3, D_1=10, D_2\neq A) ~{ = ~\tfrac 3{45}\tfrac 2{48}+\tfrac{42}{45}\tfrac 3{48} \\[1ex]=~ \dfrac{11}{180}}$$   You can now work out probabilities if the player and dealer are showing two or three cads from the same kind.   Reality Check: $3\cdot\tfrac{11}{180}+9\cdot\tfrac{11}{135}+\tfrac 1{12} = 1$ as it ought right should.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 7 '17 at 3:33       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      For the question in the comment:  dealer has $10$ plus non-ace, player has $2,3$ what is the chance the next card is $5$.

Both parties may use as many dice as they like. If the player goes over 21 then they lose and similarly to casino blackjack, the player's turn is first. For the purpose of this question, assume that the player will always keep (stay) the value of either 19, 20, 21 and would continue if the value is 18 or under. If there is a draw then the game is repeated and there is no winner.   Thanks in advance and I hope this is enough information to draw a reasonable answer.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question      edited Mar 22 '13 at 15:52       A.D   3,725 11 34        asked Mar 22 '13 at 15:36       Zonzzoz   31 1                  If the only thing you need is one number (likelihood of winning) for this one case, may be writing a simulation is faster. – gt6989b  Mar 22 '13 at 15:54            Knowing the probability distribution of the sum of 21 fair 6-sided standard dice would completely solve your problem.  Big distribution, though! – user452  Mar 22 '13 at 16:03            How does the banker play?  If he plays the same way as the player (hits on $18$ or below, stands on $19$ or above), then clearly the player will win exactly half the time. – mjqxxxx  Oct 30 '15 at 23:22        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote      You have not actually asked a question.  I suppose you want to know what the player's expected loss is.  Nor have you said how the bank adjusts to the player's behaviour.  For example, what happens if the player stays/sticks at 20 and the bank reaches 19?  Let's assume the bank is also required to follow the same rule as you give for the player, but if they both bust by going over 21 then the bank wins.  Then the probability the player busts  is about $0.286205909$ (not that far away from $\frac27$, the limit of probability that the player if throwing indefinitely hits a particular large number).  Similarly for the bank.  So the probability they both bust is this squared, i.e. about $0.081913822$ (not far away from $\frac{4}{49}$).  This is the only unfair part of the game so it is the player's expected loss if she has staked $1$.  To calculate the probability of a bust, try $p_0=1$, $p_n=\frac16 \sum_{i=0}^{i=n-1} p_i$ for $1 \le i \le 6$, $p_n=\frac16 \sum_{i=n-6}^{i=n-1} p_i$ for $6 \le i \le 19$, $p_n=\frac16 \sum_{i=n-6}^{i=18} p_i$ for $19 \le i \le 24$, and then add up $p_{22}+p_{23}+p_{24}$.  The values of $p_n$ are about  n   p_n

I apologise for not including that additional information in the original question. If the player stays on 20 and the dealer reaches 19 then the dealer will continue. So the dealer will always continue as long as the dealer's value is less than that of the player's value. If the player busts then the dealer wins and if the dealer busts then the player wins. I would like to know the probability of the Dealer winning and a draw occurring, where nobody wins. – Zonzzoz  Mar 23 '13 at 5:33            Oh also, in regards to a draw.. The player would stay on 19, 20 or 21. In this case, if the dealer's value reaches the same value as the player (i.e. player reaches 20, stays. Then the dealer reaches 20. The dealer stays and nobody wins.). Thanks again. – Zonzzoz  Mar 23 '13 at 5:36        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Your comments on my other answer suggests that the bank plays knowing what the player has.  This would not happen in a casino, partly because there may be more than one player, but if you apply that peeking here then you get the same probabilities for the player:  Player      19      20      21  Bust
        0.2847  0.2382  0.1909  0.2862  Given the player's score, the probabilities for the banker's score are  Player      19      20      21
Bank            
19      0.2847      
20      0.2382  0.2856  
21      0.1909  0.2384  0.2860
Bust    0.2862  0.4760  0.7140  So given the player's score, the probabilities for the outcome are  Player      19      20      21  Bust
PlayWin 0.2862  0.4760  0.7140  
Draw    0.2847  0.2856  0.2860  
BankWin 0.4291  0.2384          1  So multiplying these by the probabilities of the player's score and adding them up gives  Player wins 0.3312
Draw        0.2037
Bank wins   0.4651  With the approximation these would be close to $\frac{146}{441}$, $\frac{90}{441}$, $\frac{205}{441}$.  The player's expected loss is about $0.133966$, rather more than the other answer, because this time the banker is peeking at the player's score.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 23 '13 at 13:52       Henry   87.9k 3 63 133              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

In a freshly shuffled deck (standard $52$ cards), what is the probability that neither of you are dealt a blackjack. Blackjack being $2$ cards adding to $21$ i.e. $Ace + 10,J,Q,or K$ (or vice versa as order does not matter).  The farthest I've really come is that the odds of the first player getting dealt a blackjack is $128\over 2652$.  First case: Odds of getting an Ace are $4\over52$, odds of the next being 10,J,Q,or K are $16\over51$.  Other case: Odds of getting 10,J,Q,or K are $16\over52$ and Ace $4\over 51$ so ${((4*16)*2)\over (52*51)} == {128\over 2652}$  Not sure where to go from here...    probability  statistics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Feb 10 '15 at 4:57       Nolohice   308 2 12        asked Feb 10 '15 at 3:24       ADH   55 1 6                  alright just did that – ADH  Feb 10 '15 at 3:29            Are you assuming two players against the dealer?

So I deleted the more complicated answer I tried to give earlier.  The total # of possible deals to the two players is: $$\binom{52}{2}\binom{50}{2}=1,624,350$$
(i.e., choose two cards for the first player and then two for the second.)  Then, the # of ways to deal a blackjack to both players would be: $$\binom{4}{1}\binom{16}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{15}{1}=2880$$
(i.e, choose which ace to give to the first player, then which 10,J,Q,K for the first player, then which ace for the second player, and then which 10,J,Q,K for the second player.)  Also, the # of ways that exactly one player gets a blackjack would be: $$\binom{2}{1}\binom{4}{1}\binom{16}{1}\times(\binom{3}{2}+\binom{3}{1}\binom{32}{1}+\binom{47}{2})=151,040$$
(i.e., choose which player to give the blackjack, then choose which ace to give them, and then which 10,J,Q,K to give them. Then for the other player we either give them two aces from the 3 that are left, give them one ace from the 3 that are left and 1 of the 32 2-9 cards, or give them two non-aces from the 47 non-aces that are left.)  So, the probability of at least one player getting a blackjack is: $$\frac{2880+151,040}{1,624,350}$$  Hence the probability of neither player getting a blackjack is: $$1- \frac{2880+151,040}{1,624,350} \approx 90.5\%$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 11 '15 at 4:30       Michael Cotton   623 3 6                  If the player goes blackjack or busts, the dealer doesn't get to draw, so there is some conditioning between the events that may need to be addressed. – Avraham  Feb 11 '15 at 4:40            @Avraham: we are concerned with blackjack before the dealer (or even the players) draws, so this is not an issue. – Ross Millikan  Feb 11 '15 at 4:53            I had the same interpretation as Ross. – Michael Cotton  Feb 12 '15 at 2:32            Very clever Michael Cotton, thank you.

So the odds of not getting blackjack the first hand would be ((52*51)-((4*16)*2))/(52*51) after which point you know the deck is either out one or two face cards, out one or two aces, or neither. This happens every time. (until there are no more other cards, at least)  hand#       aces,face-cards     total cards

As you say, the chance than one player does not get blackjack is $\frac {2524}{2652}$  The chance that none of $n$ players gets blackjack is then $\left(\frac {2524}{2652}\right)^n$.  This is not quite correct, as the fact that the first player did not get blackjack enriches the average deck with cards that could make a blackjack for the second player.  Because the chance of one player getting blackjack is small, the enrichment is small as well, so this is not far off.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 10 '15 at 4:34       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      It might be a little simpler to deal with three separate probabilities:  Since there are four aces and 16 cards 10-K, the raw probability of a hand being blackjack is:  $$P_\text{blackjack} = \frac {4 \times 16} {\binom {52} {2}}.$$  The probability of both getting blackjack is just the probability of the player getting blackjack and the subsequent probability of the dealer also getting blackjack:  $$P_{\text{both}} = P_\text{blackjack} \times \frac{3 \times 15} {\binom {50} {2}}.$$  By the inclusion/exclusion principle, the probability of at least one getting blackjack is the sum of probabilities of each individual getting blackjack minus the probability of both getting blackjack (removes redundant overlap):  $$P_\text{either or both} = 2 P_\text{blackjack} - P_\text{both}$$  and the final result (neither gets blackjack) is just the inverse probability:
$$1 - P_\text{either or both} = 0.90524.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 5 '17 at 20:47             answered Jan 5 '17 at 20:41       nclark   166 6              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Dealer had 9 and I was dealt 2 8s. I split the 8s and was given a third card. It was an 8 so I split them again. The next card I was dealt was a fourth 8. This has happened to me three other times in my life, so no big deal. The fifth card was again an 8 and the sixth consecutive 8 followed. No one at the table or the dealer or even the pit boss had ever seen that before. I do not even know how to start calculating what the odds are in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe, which holds 416 cards. Can you help me?    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 7 '14 at 2:44      user940        asked Oct 6 '14 at 21:13       Bill Zeoli   86 1 3              8      I also wanted to add that having six $8$'s against a dealer's $9$ is not an envious position. :) – symmetricuser  Oct 6 '14 at 21:39        1      So how did the hand go? (Is it technically correct to split 8s against a dealer's 9?) – rogerl  Oct 7 '14 at 3:23            @rogerl Yup. Always split 8s! – symmetricuser  Oct 7 '14 at 4:40            In addition to any answer you might get, please understand that the probability of this happening for a given stretch of six cards is only spuriously interesting. That is, sure - the probability is very low, but what you really want to know is how likely this is to occur during some larger stretch of unknown size. You would have been just as surprised had this happened on the succeeding hand. – Christofer Ohlsson  Oct 7 '14 at 8:35        1      Given that about 1/3 of the deck has the value of "10" in blackjack, (bad) players splitting their hands 5 times isn't that uncommon.  The pit boss was probably lying when he said he has never seen it before (it is their job to make you feel lucky).  Sorry dude.  But splitting a non-10 hand that many times may be as rare as the casino suggested. – DanielV  Oct 9 '14 at 3:36        |  show 1 more comment          5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  14  down vote      We can assume that the dealer's hole card is irrelevant. So we are looking for the probability that the first six cards are $8$ out of the $415$ cards left in the deck (excluding the dealer's up-card $9$). Among the $415$ cards, there are $32$ $8$'s. There are $\binom{32}{6}$ ways of choosing six $8$'s, and there are a total of $\binom{415}{6}$ ways of choosing the first six cards. Hence, the probability is
$$\frac{\binom{32}{6}}{\binom{415}{6}} \approx 1.32\times 10^{-7},$$
which is very very small.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 6 '14 at 21:42             answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:21       symmetricuser   3,396 7 26              1      I think you mean $\frac{32\choose 6}{416\choose 6}\approx 1.3\times 10^{-7}$. If we allow other denominations besides 8, the number grows by a factor accordingly. Compare this with (the reciprocal of) the number of black jack games played / witnessed by the dealer and/or pit boss. – Hagen von Eitzen  Oct 6 '14 at 21:26        1      @HagenvonEitzen, we know one $9$ is exposed because of the dealer's up-card – symmetricuser  Oct 6 '14 at 21:35            I also said six cards, and then put $8$ in the binomial coefficients for some reason, so I edited those to $6$. – symmetricuser  Oct 6 '14 at 21:37            Great calculus, but have to take into account the 13 denominations. – Albert Masclans  May 12 '15 at 7:15        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      In 8 decks there are 32 8s.  To pick up six of them there are $\binom{32}{6}=906,192$ possible ways for that to happen.  There are, similarly, $\binom{416}{6}=6,942,219,827,088$ ways to get just any six cards.  Dividing these, that's about a 1 in 7.6 million chance for this to happen.  This is about 1/12 as likely as drawing a royal flush on five cards in a single deck.  Of course, you asked about six of any card, which is considerably easier (13 times more common than above), somewhat more likely than a royal flush.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:27       Dan Uznanski   5,754 2 10 26              2      "6,942,219,827,088 ways to get just any six cards" -- only 6,842,091,656,505 because there's a card showing. "13 times more common than above" -- Actually 12.8125 (12 + 13/16) times, because there's a card showing. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 2:29        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      $8$ decks gives a total of $52 \times 8 = 416$ cards.  $8$ decks with 4 cards each as an Eight gives a total of $32$ possible Eights to draw.  So a probability of drawing each Eight in sequence is:  $$\underbrace{\frac{32}{416} \times \frac{31}{415} \times \dots \frac{28}{412} \times \frac{27}{411}}_{\text{6 draws}}$$  If you take into account that the dealer doesn't draw an Eight, then you have $415$ cards to choose from, so a more accurate probability is:  $$\frac{32}{415} \times \frac{31}{414} \times \dots \frac{28}{411} \times \frac{27}{410}$$  Since there are 13 possible cards that can be drawn in sequence, the answer to   what the odds are in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe   is  $$13 \times \frac{32}{415} \times \frac{31}{414} \times \dots \frac{28}{411} \times \frac{27}{410}$$  which is about $1$ in every $580,798$ attempts.  Keep in mind that if you split all the Tens out of the deck, any other competent player will be angry and leave the table.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:32       DanielV   16.7k 4 25 49                  13 isn't quite right because it's harder to get 6 of the dealer's up-card than to get 6 of the other cards ... so it's about 1 in 589298. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 2:38            Well if you are going to go that far, then you have to consider his downcard as well.  You know that at least one of the 13 will be affected by his downcard as well.  And we still haven't taken into account the rules of blackjack which influence the tendency of the dealer to reshuffle decks in certain situations.  That is why "the" probability only exists in math classrooms, but for engineers and game players, there are many probabilities of progressively more accuracy. – DanielV  Oct 7 '14 at 4:26            No, you don't have to consider his downcard, because you don't know what it is, just like you don't know what the last card in the deck is. Probabilities are a function of known information. What you're trying to do is take it much further than what I wrote in an attempt to avoid its validity. The simple fact is that you took the up card into account to reduce 416 to 415, but not to reduce 13 to 12.8125, and that's simply a mistake. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 5:27        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Clarification: I have interpreted the phrase "what are the odds in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe"
 as asking for the chance that there are  6 straight cards of the same denomination from 
an 8 deck shoe. My answer addresses this interpretation only.   Ignoring the details of the game, I'll just consider the 
chance that  a  well-shuffled 8-deck shoe has  6 or more  eights in a row
somewhere.  I solved a similar problem here.  For your problem,  put $b=384$ and $w=32$ in my answer above to 
arrive at  \begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}(\mbox{at least 6 eights in a row})
&=&{378917534435104330038751954618647 
\over 7539892080833060495675366062952229323}\\[5pt]
&=&0.000050255,\end{eqnarray*}
 or about 1 in 20,000.  If you ask for the probability of at least 6 in 
a row of any of the 13 possible values, an approximate answer is to 
multiply the above by 13, giving $P\approx .0006533$
or about 1 in 1350. Not a common occurrence, but 
 not that rare!     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ♦   1        answered Oct 6 '14 at 21:55      user940              1      Your calculations address a different question than the one posted above. – Mico  Oct 7 '14 at 0:04            My calculations address this question, taken directly from the original post: "what the odds are in getting 6 straight cards of the same denomination from an 8 deck shoe, which holds 416 cards." – user940  Oct 7 '14 at 0:20            This obviously doesn't answer the same question, because the OP is interested in the odds of drawing 6 of the same card, not the odds that there are 6 of the same card in a row somewhere in the shoe. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 2:42            @JimBalter Are you saying that in blackjack you are always dealt the top cards off the shoe? I don't play blackjack, so I don't know. I thought that you sometimes be dealt cards from the middle of the shoe, so to speak. – user940  Oct 7 '14 at 2:58            It doesn't matter where in the shoe the deal comes from, as long as you haven't seen any of the other cards ... probabilities depend on knowledge. In any case, a run elsewhere in the shoe could go to another player, or get split between players, or never get dealt ... it obviously isn't what the OP is asking about. The OP asked " odds are in getting 6 straight cards" -- "in getting" means being dealt 6 such cards in the manner that happened to the OP, not just having those cards in the shoe somewhere. – Jim Balter  Oct 7 '14 at 3:03         |  show 4 more comments            up vote  0  down vote      Calculations from symmetricuser were all perfect when trying to calculate the probability of taking, for example, 6 8's in a row. Even though you ask for 6 cards in a row, of any denomination, so you are not forcing the number. Therefore, you have to multiply that for all the 13 possible denominations.  $$13\times \frac{\binom{32}{6}}{\binom{415}{6}} \approx 1.72\times 10^{-6},$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 12 '15 at 11:07             answered May 12 '15 at 7:14       Albert Masclans   983 5 20              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Blackjack Probability Odds  Blackjack odds are percentage figures which represent your probability of losing or winning a hand. They can also represent the house edge or their profit margins as well. Usually probability odds don't mean much on the short term, but they clearly average out in the long term and this is why the casinos always win over the long term.  We decided to make a few tables and charts of the most common blackjack probability odds for various scenarios and situations found while playing blackjack. The most important odds percentage represents the dealer's edge in the game. This is the long term advantage that they have which will eventually take your money away. Blackjack is actually one of the most popular games in the casino and also has some of the lowest odds of all the casino games, except casino craps of course. Generally their edge ranges from 1% to 15% depending on what variation of blackjack you are playing.  How to Beat the Casino House Odds  There is one feature that makes blackjack more desirable than any other casino game. There is actually a way to beat the house edge by increasing your odds. In fact, your probability odds in blackjack can be increase to the point where you would actually be making the profit in the long term, essentially turning the casino into a personal ATM. This practice is known as card counting and casinos don't like this because they know they will be losing money.  Before you start card counting, you should learn "blackjack basic strategy", which is the mathematically correct way to play every move in blackjack to get the best odds. This can lower the house edge to less than 1 percent. When that percentage goes to a negative number such as -1%, then it is you who has the edge over the casino. This is when you complement basic strategy with card counting to get the highest efficiencies.  Odds vs. Dealer Up Card  The first odds chart shows what kind of advantage the player has vs. the dealer based on what his up card is showing. The first column in the chart is what card the dealer has showing after the cards have been dealt. The second column of the table shows the dealer's probability of going bust based on each card. The last column shows the advantage the player has and the probability of winning based on the basic strategy theory. As you can see, the dealer has about a 43% chance of going bust when he has a 5 showing as an up card. At the same time, the player has about 23% advantage as well. Notice that the player advantage goes negative when the 10 cards and ace start showing up. This means the player is more likely to lose.     Dealer's Up Card  Dealer Odds of Busting  Player Advantage Percentage      2  35.30%  9.8%    3  37.56%  13.4%    4  40.28%  18.0%    5  42.89%  23.2%    6  42.08%  23.9%    7  25.99%  14.3%    8  23.86%  5.4%    9  23.34%  -4.3%    10  21.43%  -16.9%    J  21.43%  -16.9%    Q  21.43%  -16.9%    K  21.43%  -16.9%    A  11.65%  -16.0%     Blackjack odds of Busting While Taking a Hit  This chart shows the probabilities of going bust after taking a hit. Busting means that your card total would go over 21 points and would be a hard total as well. The highest score you can get when being initially dealt two cards is 21 points so you can never go bust. This means if you took a hit on a hard 21, you would have a 100% probablity of going bust, which is common sense. Also, if you have 11 points or less, it is impossible to go over 21 points on the next hit and your odds of going bust would be 0 percent.     Total Hand Value  Probability of Going Bust      21  100%    20  92%    19  85%    18  77%    17  69%    16  62%    15  58%    14  56%    13  39%    12  31%    11 or less  0%     House Advantage with Multiple Number of Decks  The number of 52 card decks in a game of blackjack influences the house edge. In some cases, the odds increase in favor of the casino when more decks are used. The advantage edge can be as much as 1% towards the casino and this is a big number in terms of odds over the long term. As you can see here, a single deck of card gives the lowest edge for the casino and gives the player better odds. Multiple decks such as eight decks increases the house edge almost 18 times more than it would for the single deck!     Number of Decks  House Odds Advantage      Single Deck  0.04%    Double Deck  0.42%    Four Decks  0.61%    Six Decks  0.67%    Eight Decks  0.70%      Two Card Frequency Odds  The next odds table deals with the first two cards being dealt or the 2 card frequency odds. Every player is dealt two cards at the beginning of a round of blackjack so this chart tells you the percentage of getting different categories of hands. A natural blackjack is only 4.8%, which essentially is an ace dealt with a ten card straight off the initial deal. Normally the odds are 3 to 2 and you would win $3 for every $2 wagered. It's a small percentage but it's the most desirable hand to get. The lowest hand you can get is two points (two aces). This is part of the decision hands group where players are usually dealt soft hands and can make decisions without going bust. This group is the most common.  The other category is the hard standing hands. These hands are somewhat desirable because of the high scores likely to beat the dealer. These are the second most frequent two card blackjack hands. Finally there is a no bust two card hand. No bust means any two card hand that won't bust on the next hit, such as any soft hand or hard hand that is 11 points or less.     Two Card Combination  Frequency Percentage      Natural 21 Blackjack  4.8%    Hard Standing (17 - 20)  30.0%    Decision Hands (2-16)  38.7%    No Bust  26.5%    Total (all two card hands)  100%     Probability Edge for Each Card Removed from Deck  The next table shows how much your odds improve after when certain cards have been dealt and removed from the deck. Certain cards taken out of the deck and increase or decrease your blackjack odds percentage and the house edge.  This is very important for card counting. If you want the absolute perfect odds in card counting, you have to acount for each small change in the odds whenever a card is dealt. As you can see from the table, when small cards are taken out of play, the odds increase in your favor overall. This is a paramount property of card counting. The opposite happens when large cards are dealt. Your odds begin to decrease. When you are counting cards, you will notice your count decreasing when large cards are dealt.  You can imagine how complicated it would be to be adding these numbers in your head while card counting at the same time. If your mind was a computer, it would be easier to keep track of the percentage. Some people can do this, and this is the way to become a perfect card counter! It is easier to keep track of the odds when playing with a single blackjack deck. For example, when five cards are seen on the table, they offer a 0.67% increase in your advantage. In fact, when a lot of fives are used up, your odds will be much higher than if any of the other low cards were used up, even the six point cards.

Usually in blackjack, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. These rules are slightly different for other variations of twenty-one. So generally, the odds of the dealer's final score being 16 are 0% because he must hit. This table will show the probability of the dealer busting or getting a non-bust hand as well as natural blackjacks.

View Desktop Version                Blackjack    Blackjack (also known as twenty-one or sometimes pontoon) is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. The name blackjack comes from the fact that when blackjack was first introduced in the U.S. it wasn't very popular, so casinos and gambling houses tried offering different bonus payoffs. One of those was a 10-to-1 payoff for a hand consisting of the ace of spades and a black jack (that is, the jack of spades or the jack of clubs). With the current rules, a blackjack hand doesn't even need to contain a jack.  Rules  A blackjack game has a dealer and one or more players. Each player plays against the dealer. All players are initially dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face down and one face up (these are called the hole card and up card respectively).  Each player can then hit (ask for an additional card) until her total exceeds 21 (this is called busting) or she decides to stand (stop taking cards for the rest of the hand). Face cards count as 10 and an ace may be counted as 1 or 11.  After all of the players have finished, the dealer reveals the hole card and plays the hand with a fixed strategy: hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.  The player loses if she busts and wins if she does not bust and the dealer does (observe that if both the player and the dealer bust, the player loses).  Otherwise, the player wins if her total is closer to 21 than the dealer's. If the player wins, she gets twice her bet; if she loses, she loses her money. If the dealer and player tie it is called a "push;" the player keeps her bet but does not earn any additional money.  If the player's first two cards total 21, this is a blackjack and she wins 1.5 times her bet (unless the dealer also has a blackjack, in which case a tie results), so she gets back 2.5 times her bet.   Soft Hand. A hand that contains an ace that can be counted as 11 is called a soft hand, since one cannot
bust by taking a card. With soft hands, the basic strategy is to always hit 17 or less and even hit 18 if the dealer's up card is 9 or 10 (where the 10 refers to a 10, J, Q, or K).   Doubling down. After the player is dealt her initial two cards she has the option of doubling her bet and asking for one additional card (which is dealt face down). The player may not hit beyond this single required card.  With the basic strategy, you should always double with a total of 11, double with 10 unless the dealer's up card is 10 or A, and double with 9 only against a dealer's 2 to 6. (Some casinos only allow doubling down on 11).   Splitting pairs. At the beginning of a hand, if the player has two cards with the same number (that is, a pair) she has the option of splitting the pair and playing two hands. In principle, a pair of aces should of course be split, but in this case blackjack rules allow you to get only one card on each hand, and getting a 10 does not make a blackjack. With the basic strategy, you should never split 10's, 5's or 4's, always split 8's, and, in the other cases, split against an up card of 2 to 7, but not otherwise.  Strategies for the Player  Blackjack is almost always disadvantageous for the player, meaning that no strategy yields a positive expected payoff for the player.  In the long run, whatever you do, you will on average lose money. Exceptions exist: some casinos offer special rules that allow a player using the right strategy to have a positive expected payoff; such casinos are counting on the players making mistakes.  The so called basic strategy is based on the player's point total and the dealer's visible card. It consists of a table that describes what you should do in any situation in the game (you can find an example of this table at Wikipedia ). Under the most favorable set of rules, the house advantage against a player using the basic strategy can be as low as 0.16%.  Many people assume that the best strategy for the player is to mimic the dealer. A second conservative strategy is called never bust: hit 11 or less, stand on 12 or more. Each of these strategies leads to a player disadvantage of about 6%.  Beat the Dealer What does it mean to have a 0.16% disadvantage? When discussing casino games, one usually finds statements such as the ones above saying something like: "the house advantage in this game is about 0.16%". A first explanation is the following: betting ten dollars each hand, you will in the long run lose an average of 1.6 cents per hand.  It would be nice to have an idea of the probability of winning any particular bet when playing some specific strategy. Indeed, we can infer this from the player's disadvantage. Let's take, as an example, the potential 0.16% disadvantage when playing the basic strategy. Suppose you bet $1 at each of 10,000 bets playing the basic strategy. Let's call p the total probability of winning a pass line bet (so p is the number we are trying to calculate). If p was, for example, 0.5, it would mean that, on average, half the times you should win the bet, so you would win 0.5 · 10,0000 = 5,000 times.  Since each time you win a bet you get twice what you bet and each time you lose the bet you lose all the money, you would end up with 5,000 · $2 = $10,000, that is, the same total amount
you bet (10,000 times $1). In this case, the house advantage is 0%, as is the player advantage. The same idea applies for any p: if you bet 10,000, you should, on average, win the bet 10,000p times, so your average payoff is $20,000p. In our case, the house advantage is 0.16%, so if you play $10,000, on average you end up with $10,000 - $10,000 · 0.0016 = $10,000 - $16 = $9,984. So we only have to solve the equation $20,000p = $9,984 to get p = 0.4992. Links You can find more information on blackjack's rules, strategies, and history on the Internet.

Problems    If you are dealt a point total of 16, what is the probability of busting if you hit, assuming that a whole deck will be used to choose among when you are dealt your next card?  If you are dealt a 3 and an ace, what is the probability of not busting if you hit, assuming that a whole deck will be used to choose among when you are dealt your next card?  Suppose you are the only player against the dealer, and you are in the first hand of a game played with one deck. You are dealt an 8 and a 6, while the dealer is showing a queen. What is the probability that you bust if you decide to hit?

      first present the probabilities attached to card dealing and initial
      predictions. In making this calculus, circumstantial information such as
      fraudulent dealing is not taken into account (as in all situations
      corresponding to card games). All probabilities are calculated for cases
      using one or two decks of cards. Let us look at the probabilities for a
      favorable initial hand (the first two cards dealt) to be achieved. The
      total number of possible combinations for each of the two cards is C(52,
      2) = 1326, for the 1-deck game and C(104, 2)=5356  for the 2-deck game.  Probability of obtaining a natural 
		blackjack is  P  = 8/663 = 1.20663%  in
      the case of a 1-deck game and  P
      = 16/1339 = 1.19492%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.   Probability
      of obtaining a blackjack from the first two cards is  P  = 32/663 = 4.82654%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P = 64/1339= 4.77968%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.     Similarly,
      we can calculate the following probabilities:  Probability
      of obtaining 20 points from the first two cards is  P = 68/663 = 10.25641%  in
      the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 140/1339 = 10.45556%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.    Probability
      of obtaining 19 points from the first two cards is  P = 40/663 = 6.03318%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P = 80/1339 = 5.97460%  in the case of a 2-deck game.    Probability
      of obtaining 18 points from the first two cards is  P  = 43/663 = 6.48567%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 87/1339 = 6.4973%  in
      the case of a 2-deck game.    Probability
      of getting 17 points from the first two cards is  P  = 16/221 = 7.23981%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 96/1339 = 7.16952%  in the case of a 2-deck game.    A good initial hand (which you can stay with) could be a blackjack or
      a hand of 20, 19 or 18 points. The probability of obtaining such a hand is
      calculated by totaling the corresponding probabilities calculated
      above:  P = 32/663 + 68/663 + 40/663 + 43/663 = 183/663, in the case
      of a 1-deck game and  P = 64/1339 + 140/1339 + 80/1339 + 87/1339 =
      371/1339, in the case of a 2-deck game.  Probability
      of obtaining a good initial hand is  P  = 183/663 = 27.60180%  in the case of a 1-deck game and  P  = 371/1339 = 27.70724%  in the case of a 2-deck game.     The
      probabilities of events predicted during the game are calculated on the
      basis of the played cards (the cards showing) from a certain moment. This
      requires counting certain favorable cards showing for the dealer and for
      the other players, as well as in your own hand. Any 
		blackjack strategy is
      based on counting the cards played. Unlike a baccarat game, where a
      maximum of three cards are played for each player, at blackjack many cards
      could be played at a certain moment, especially when many players are at
      the table. T hus, both following and memorizing certain cards require some
      ability and prior training on the player’s part. Card counting techniques 
		cannot however be applied in  online blackjack .  The
      formula of probability for obtaining a certain favorable value is similar
      to that for baccarat and depends on the number of decks of cards used. If
      we denote by x a favorable value, by nx the number of cards
      showing with the value x (from your hand, the hands of the other
      players and the face up card in the dealer’s hand) and by nv the
      total number of cards showing, then the probability of the next card from
      the deck (the one you receive if you ask for an additional card) having
      the value x is:      This
      formula holds for the case of a 1-deck game. In the case of a 2-deck game,
      the probability is:   Generally
      speaking, if playing with m decks, the probability of obtaining a
      card with the value x is:       Example
      of application of the formula: Assume play with one deck, you
      are the only player at table, you hold Q , 2, 4, A (total
      value 17) and the face up card of the dealer is a 4. Let us calculate the
      probability of achieving 21 points (receiving a 4).  We
      have  nx = 2, nv = 5, so:   .  For
      the probability of achieving 20 points (receiving a 3), we have  nx = 0, nv = 5, so:   .  For
      the probability of achieving 19 points (receiving a 2), we have  nx = 1, nv = 5, so:   .  If
      we want to calculate the probability of achieving 19, 20 or 21 points, all
      we must do is total the three probabilities just calculated. We obtain  P = 9/47 = 19.14893%.  Unlike
      in baccarat, where fewer cards are played, the number of players is
      constant (two), and the number of gaming situations is very limited, in blackjack, the number of possible playing configurations is in the
      thousands and, as a practical matter, cannot be entirely covered by tables
      of values.       Sources     A big part of the gaming situations that require a decision, where the
      total value held is 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 points, is comprised in

Blackjack, however, is one of the only casino games where you as a player have a fair shot against the house. This is because blackjack depends on strategizing based on probability instead of pure luck. To increase your chances of winning at blackjack, first learn the basic strategies of playing your cards wisely and then master a card counting system.         Steps   Learning Blackjack Strategies    Blackjack Rules  Blackjack Cheat Sheet  Blackjack Chart        Part 1   Learning from Scratch          1   Memorize the basic terms of the game. The game itself is simple enough to figure out. Every player knows they need to get to 21 to beat the dealer. However, many players don’t understand the terms used beyond hitting to get another card or staying to end their term. Before you play, know about asking to double down, split your hand, or surrender your hand so you can incorporate these into your betting strategies and give yourself the best chance of winning. [1]   When you choose to double down, you double your bet and receive only one more card.  When you have two of the same card, such as a pair of twos, you can split them and play them as two hands with two separate bets.  Very few casinos allow you to surrender your hand. When you have a bad hand, you can surrender and save half your bet.           2   Mitigate the house advantage. The dealer gains an advantage because the player must act first without knowing what the hole card, the face-down card, is. Also, once you go over 21, or bust, you lose even if the dealer busts as well. Once you understand this, you’ll realize that winning depends upon reacting to the cards you have as well as those other players and the dealer show on the table in order to predict what card the dealer has face-down.         3   Study basic blackjack strategy. Because blackjack is a game of probabilities compared to other casino games, you will be a stronger player by learning how to play certain hands. For example, do you hit on your 16 when the dealer has a ten? Do you split your eights? Study a chart to determine which choice you should make depending on what cards you have and what card the dealer shows. [2]   At first you’ll find it hard to remember how to act during various in-game scenarios, but the more you play, the more you’ll learn how to play your hand by instinct.           4   Find out the table’s game rules before you start playing. Different casinos or blackjack games feature different rules. Many games use multiple decks of cards in order to discourage card counting, throwing off your ability to track your odds of winning. Most games of blackjack require the dealer to stop at 17, even if this means the dealer loses, but the rules may allow for the dealer to hit on a soft 17, which is a 17 made with an ace (the ace can be a one or an 11). [3]   A game that makes it harder for you to win in the long term, such as one that allows the dealer to hit on a soft 17, should be avoided. [4]   Avoid continuous shuffle machines when playing in person. These machines make keeping track of possible cards you and the dealer can draw an impossibility.           5   Check the table’s blackjack rules. Before you start playing at a table, it’s important to find out how you will be paid for a blackjack. If you get a natural blackjack, a 21 on the first two cards dealt to you, a table may pay you 3:2, which is $3 for every $2 wagered. Others will pay you less, such as 6:5, and should be avoided. [5]   6:5 odds are worse for you than 3:2. Consider that if you bet and win twice on the first odds, you’ll bet ten units to win 12 units. 12 units on the second odds makes for four bets totalling eight units bet to win 12 units. [6]            6   Formulate your betting strategy. In an average game, it’s best to be consistent or, at most, increase your bet by one dollar or other unit of measurement until you win. Remember that there is no such thing as being due for a win or hot and cold decks. Any such pattern you perceive will disappear over time because the game is based on chance and probability. Instead, try betting low after a loss or deck shuffle and increase your bet a little when you perceive the odds are in your favor.         7   Increase your bet when the odds are in your favor. Many high cards in the deck work better for you since they always amount to ten and help you get more blackjacks. The more you play, the more you’ll gain a sense of how many helpful cards remain in the deck and how to proceed with the hand you have. Once you have a grasp of your odds of winning, you can more aggressively bet on good hands.         8   Resist buying insurance. The dealer will give you an option to buy protection in case the dealer has a blackjack. This means you in essence make a side bet that the dealer will have blackjack. If the dealer does have blackjack, you will win your side bet but lose your original bet. This may get you back some money in the short-term, but long-term the bet makes the casino money. [7]   Beginner players have no way of knowing if the dealer has a card worth ten points face-down under an ace. Card counters however have a better idea and can use their information to make money on this bet.                 Part 2   Counting Cards          1   Assign values to cards. Under the Hi-Lo method of card counting, each numbered card has a value. Cards two through six are worth one point. Cards seven through nine are worth zero points. The ten card, face cards, and the aces are worth negative one point each. [8]   The idea is that you’ll keep a total value of all the cards on display, and as more face cards are left in the deck you’ll make more blackjacks while the dealer busts more.  The Hi-Lo method is a common counting system, but other systems exist that give different point values to certain cards such as aces and fives.           2   Practice keeping a running count. Use a single deck of cards. Turn over the cards one by one, adding up the values as you go. If you draw a two, a five, and an ace, you’ll have a value of one. When you reach the end of the deck, your running total should equal zero. Repeat practice until you’re able to keep your total quickly and quietly.         3   Keep a true count. Casinos are wise to card counters, so they play blackjack with multiple decks at the same time. The true count takes the running count and divides it by the number of decks in play. This count gives you more of an idea of how much of an advantage you have in betting.  A running count of three is fine in a one-deck game, but this number means less when there are multiple decks since there are more cards to factor that reduce your chances of winning.  For example, a seven running count divided by two decks leaves you with a true count of about three. But if there are six decks in play, the true count is only about one.           4   Practice maintaining true counts. Start off by using a few decks. Flip over the cards one by one and grow accustomed to dividing with fractions. At first you can simply round the division into a general true count, but as you go you’ll become more able to perform more accurate divisions in your head with less effort.  An online card counting simulator can help you practice. Some simulators can correct your counting mistakes and track your winnings.           5   Keep a count with distractions. Once you feel comfortable keeping a true count, try mimicking the feel of a casino. First, start small. Add a little music or radio chatter. As you grow more capable, bring in a friend, roommate, or partner. Later on you can practice during loud events such as parties. Eventually you’ll be able to carry on conversations while calculating the true count in your mind. [9]          6   Adjust your betting. When you put your calculations to practice, raise the amount you bet when the count is high in the positives. Remember to remain inconspicuous. Remain natural, talking to other players and the dealer rather than muttering to yourself. Raise your bet by small amounts when you can and lower your bets when you lose. Instead of sitting around at a table for hours, leave when your winning begins to attract suspicion. [10]   Card counting is legal but casinos frown upon it because it costs them money.
