The odds may surprise you           Dave Mosher and Skye Gould     Feb. 15, 2018, 5:04 PM    40,840          facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link     Shutterstock A 19-year-old gunman allegedly killed 17 people at a Florida high school on Wednesday. Nearly 13,000 people in the US were murdered with firearms in 2015. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC. But research is bootstrapped because of federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. AR-15 rifle that he purchased legally It was the deadliest school shooting in Florida history. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had reportedly been known as a threat to the school, and teachers have bemoaned how they were powerless to stop him. Cruz's victims join a growing number of people in the US intentionally killed at the end of a gun. Below is how the lifetime odds of dying from gun violence (highlighted in red; suicides and accidents excluded) stack up against many causes of death for Americans: Skye Gould/Business Insider Assaults by firearm kill about 13,000 people in the US each year, which translates to a roughly 1-in-315 lifetime chance of death from gun violence. That's about 56% more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a car, truck, or van. It's also more than 11 times as high as dying from any force of nature, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, or lightning strike. These measures also suggest Americans are more likely to die from gun violence than the combined risks of drowning, fire and smoke, stabbing, choking on food, airplane crashes, animal attacks, and natural disasters. Where the data comes from Parents wait for news after a report of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Associated Press/Joel Auerbach The chart above does not account for a person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that could shift the results; it's an average of the entire US population. But it clearly shows that gun violence in the US is a leading cause of death, which is how the CDC describes firearm homicides in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Most of the data comes from an October 2017 report by the National Safety Council and a November 2017 report by the National Center for Health Statistics on causes of death in the US, primarily those that occurred in 2015. (The NSC report uses 2014 data wherever newer data was unavailable.) Mass shootings aren't part of the data sets above, but the Gun Violence Archive project keeps a sourced tally , which we've independently counted. The organization considers any event where four or more victims were injured (regardless of death) to be a mass shooting. In 2015, some 333 mass shootings left 367 people dead and 1,328 injured. The statistics rose in 2016 to 383 mass shootings, 456 deaths, and 1,537 injuries. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings that led to 437 deaths and 1,802 injuries. Foreign-born terrorism data comes from Cato Institute terrorism data , and some natural-disaster data comes from Tulane University . We calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2015 life expectancy and population numbers in the US, and our analysis assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (Mortality data from previous years suggests these rankings are relatively consistent, with the exception of skyrocketing accidental poisonings due to the opioid epidemic. ) You can view our full dataset and sourcing here . A dearth of US gun-violence research Although gun violence is one of the leading causes of death in America, it is also one of the most poorly researched, according to a January 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least-funded cause of death after falls," the study's authors wrote. The study ascribed this dearth of research to restrictions — namely a 21-year-old congressional appropriations bill called the Dickey Amendment that stipulated "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Research into gun violence is the most poorly funded relative to other causes of death. Dr. David E. Stark, Dr. Nigam H. Shah/JAMA This and other federal funding restrictions are still active, hindering many scientists from understanding the problem. "The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done," Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, told Mother Jones in a January 2017 story . "It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources." But what questions have been researched by private institutions like the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a clear connection between gun ownership, gun availability, homicides, and violent death. A roundup of gun-control and gun-violence studies by German Lopez at Vox shows Americans represent less than 5% of the world population but possess nearly 50% of the world's civilian-owned guns, police are about three times more likely to be killed in states with high gun ownership, countries with more guns see more gun deaths , and states with tighter gun control laws see fewer gun-related deaths . This story was updated with the latest final data from CDC, which covers the year 2015. We previously stated that about 11,000 people in the US are killed during firearm assaults; that was a 2014 statistic. In 2015, nearly 13,000 people in the US were killed during firearm assaults.

In order to attempt an answer to that question, let's focus on 2012 first. This year, there have been four shootings at K-12 schools (note: I had to ignore two shootings on US college campuses to come up with this number). Here are the incidents:   1. February 10, 2012: A student shot and killed himself in front of 70 classmates at a public high school in Walpole, New Hampshire.   2. February 12, 2012: A former student killed three students and injured six in a shooting at a public high school in Chadron, Ohio.   3. March 6, 2012: A disgruntled former teacher shot and killed the headmistress of a private religious high school in Jacksonville, Florida.   4. December 14, 2012: 27 people, including the shooter, were killed in a Newtown, Connecticut public elementary school. The shooter also killed one other person at his home prior to going to the school.  But really, how common are school shootings in the United States? Four seems like an excessive number. After culling through the incidents from the last thirteen years, here are the number of US school shootings per year (data from infoplease.com ):   2000 : 4  2001 : 5  2002 : 2  2003 : 3  2004 : 0  2005 : 2  2006 : 4  2007 : 2  2008 : 3  2009 : 0  2010 : 1  2011 : 2  2012 : 4  It appears that 2012 is on the high end, although it is not completely atypical. Taking a strict average over the last thirteen years, the US experiences 2.46 school shootings per year.  It is also interesting to note that these shootings have taken place all over the country and in all regions. There does not seem to be a difference between socioeconomic status or rural/urban setting. However, most school shootings take place at high schools. Of the 32 US school shootings from 2000 through 2012, 23 of them took place in a high school. Only three took place in an elementary school. Five took place in a middle school. One took place in a one-room Amish K-12 schoolhouse.     Now that we have an understanding of the number of school shootings in a given year, we need to know how many schools there are. The best estimate from the Center for Education Reform is that there are about 132,656 K-12 schools, both public and private, in the United States. There are about 99,000 public schools, but I am including private schools in my calculation because a number of the school shootings over the last 13 years took place at private religious schools.  So, what are the odds that a school shooting will occur in your child's school in 2013? If you take the average number of school shootings per year and compare it to the number of schools in the US, you get 2.46:132,656. Reducing that down reveals the following statistic:   The chances of any particular K-12 school in the United States experiencing a shooting incident in any given year is approximately 1 in 53,925 .  Breaking the numbers down a little further reveals the following statistics:   The chances of a school shooting taking place in a US high school in any given year: 1 in 21,000 .   The chances of a school shooting taking place in a US elementary or middle school in any given year: 1 in 141,463 . (data for the number of elementary and middle schools is not separated by agencies keeping track of such numbers)  Please note, this is not a scientific study. I relied on publicly available numbers and a probability statistic calculation that is simple enough to be taught to middle school students. It is obviously much more complicated than I have presented it to be--there are a number of factors that would need to be examined prior to claiming that 1 in 53,925 is wholly accurate. And, not every shooting incident is as horrendous as the one in Newtown, Connecticut. In some shootings, only the shooter died. In other incidents, no one was killed. But, in each incident, at least one gun was fired in a school.  Also keep in mind, your chances of dying in a car crash in 2013 is approximately 1 in 7775, which is about the same as your chances of dying due to any type of gun violence in the next year.   The question we now need to ask ourselves is what is an acceptable level of risk? Are we willing to ride in cars? Are we willing to keep guns around? Are we willing to send our kids to school?  As far as the school shooting question goes, there is extremely little chance your child's school will experience a school shooting incident in 2013. But, we are virtually guaranteed to have a few school shootings somewhere in the US in the next year. It probably won't happen to us. It probably won't happen in our city. It probably won't even happen in our state.  But, it will happen to someone. It seems like we should do something about that, don't you think?

Misleading stats make finding a solution to the problem of gun violence that much harder, says David Mastio, deputy editorial page editor.

(Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 45 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Correction & clarification: Because of an editing error, Jonesboro, Ark., was mislabeled. With the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., several days gone but hardly forgotten, the time seems right to examine closely some of the statistical hype that made frightening news alongside details of the horrific shooting. In print and on TV, Americans were bombarded with facts and figures suggesting that the problem of school shootings was out of control. We were informed, for example, that since 2013 there has been an average of one school shooting a week in the U.S., and 18 since the beginning of this year. While these statistics were not exactly lies or fake news, they involved stretching the definition of a school shooting well beyond the limits of most people’s imagination. More: No, there have not been 18 school shootings already this year More: We have a right to bear arms. But after the Florida shooting, it's time for conversation. Everytown for Gun Safety reported that there have been 290 school shootings since the catastrophic massacre in Newtown, Conn., more than five years ago. However, very few of these were anything akin to Sandy Hook or Parkland. Sure, they all involved a school of some type (including technical schools and colleges) as well as a firearm, but the outcomes were hardly similar. Nearly half of the 290 were completed or attempted suicides, accidental discharges of a gun, or shootings with not a single individual being injured. Of the remainder, the vast majority involved either one fatality or none at all. It is easy to believe that school shootings are the “new normal” as has been intimated, or that we are facing a crisis of epidemic proportions. When schools are placed on lockdown based on an active shooter alert (which many times is a false alarm), cable news channels immediately inform their viewers of the danger, and word is tweeted and retweeted to millions, most of whom have no direct connection to the event. And when gunshots ring out, we hear the sounds replayed from cellphone recordings and watch through satellite feed as terrified survivors flee the scene. It makes a lasting impression, to be sure. For all those who believe that schools are under siege like never before, it is instructive to take a statistical road trip back in time. Since 1990, there have been 22 shootings at elementary and secondary schools in which two or more people were killed, not counting those perpetrators who committed suicide. Whereas five of these incidents have occurred over the past five-plus years since 2013, claiming the lives of 27 victims (17 at Parkland), the latter half of the 1990s witnessed seven multiple-fatality shootings with a total of 33 killed (13 at Columbine ). In fact, the 1997-98 school year was so awful, with four multiple-fatality shooting sprees at the hands of armed students (in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, Ore.), that then-President Clinton formed a White House expert committee to advise him. Nearly a decade later, President Bush convened a White House Conference on School Safety in the wake of multiple-fatality incidents during his administration. More: Survivor: I will never be OK until we stop school shootings POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Of course, I don’t mean to minimize any of the one-per week on average school shootings, but they should not be conflated with the most deadly but rare events. Unfortunately, most readers and viewers don’t appreciate the distinction when statistics including non-fatal school shootings are cited whenever there is mass killing at a school. Notwithstanding the occasional multiple-fatality shooting that takes place at one of the 100,000 public  schools across America, the nation’s schools are safe. Over the past quarter-century, on average about 10 students are slain in school shootings annually. Compare the school fatality rate with the more than 100 school-age children accidentally killed each year riding their bikes  or walking to school. Congress might be too timid to pass gun legislation to protect children, but how about a national bicycle helmet law for minors? Half of the states do not require them. There is no NRA — National Riding Association — opposing that. I’m all for shielding our kids from harm. But let’s at least deal with the low hanging fruit while we debate and Congress does nothing about the role of guns in school shootings.

By Jason Bedrick   Share Tweet  Like  Submit  Plus      Schools are stocking up on M16s and modified grenade launchers and holding drills involving shooting blanks in middle and high school hallways , but is the risk really worth the expense and possibility of preemptively traumatizing children?  Groups like Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety argue that our nation’s schools are dangerous, claiming that there have been 74 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012 in an infographic that went viral earlier this summer. But a closer look at their numbers revealed that they artificially inflated the statistic by including suicides, accidents, incidents related to criminal activity (e.g. - drug dealing or robbery), and incidents that took place outside of school hours or were unconnected to members of any school community. Moreover, half of those incidents took place on college campuses. Since Sandy Hook, the actual number of K-12 school shootings in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder has been ten—a far cry from the “one school shooting per week” that President Obama claimed back in June.  Surely even one such incident is too high, but with nearly 106,000 public and private schools in the U.S., there were shootings at only 0.009% of schools since December 2012. According to the National Center for Education Statistics’ 2013 “ Indicators of School Crime and Safety ” report, from the 1992-93 school year until the 2010-11 school year, there were between 11 and 34 homicides of youths ages 5-18 at schools each year (including attacks with weapons other than firearms), with an average of about 23 homicides per year. Comparing that to NCES’s enrollment statistics, about 0.000044% of public and private K-12 students were killed at school per year between 1992-93 and 2010-11. That’s about one out of every 2,273,000 students per year. By contrast, the odds of being hit by lightning in a given year is one out of 700,000 according to National Geographic .

School shootings, especially the mass casualty incidents like Sandy Hook, are exceedingly rare. Schools should dispense with the M16s, grenade launchers, and armored vehicles.

Are Private Schools Statistically Safer than Public Schools? January 23, 2018       Tweet                    There’s a great deal of debate when it comes to the comparison of private schools and public K-12 schools. Many families have concerns about safety at public schools - and some have bad reputations that justify those concerns.   Various studies and statistics tend to support the notion that private K-12 schools are statistically safer than public K-12 schools.  Sadly, many of those sending their children to dangerous public schools don't have a choice in the matter - as school assignment is typically based on geography. P rivate school parents can send their children anywhere they want.  Safety Concerns in Schools Today  Public and private academic organizations alike have a lot to deal with these days. School shootings , gangs, crime, drugs, alcohol, discrimination, bullying, misbehavior, physical assault, and even acts of terrorism are just a few of the issues parents and school administrators have to worry about and protect against.  School Shooting Statistics  An active shooter scenario is among the worst of parents’ fears. These acts of violence get a lot of publicity, as they should.  When a tragedy like this occurs, our nation comes together to mourn for those lost. It also gives us the opportunity to bring the issue of school violence to light.  Keeping School Violence in Perspective  While school violence is on many people’s minds, it’s also important to keep things in perspective . Because of mass shootings, people assume kids have a higher degree of risk today than say 20 years ago. Statistically speaking, this isn’t the case.  Few realize the odds of a student being killed at school were 7 times higher in the 1991-1992 school year than they were in the 2010-2011 school term.   The odds of getting struck by lightning are one in 700,000.  The odds of a student being killed at school are one in 2,700,000.   Regardless of the statistics, the loss of even one child to violence is one too many, which is why schools must take precautions and find ways to reduce acts of violence on school grounds.  Are School Shootings More Common at Private Schools or Public K-12 Schools?  A review of the mass school shootings list confirms that most K-12 school shootings have occurred at public institutions. As of 2017, private K-12 academic institutes have been, for the most part, spared from large-scale mass shootings.  However, it’s important to keep in mind that anything could happen in the future .  Neither private nor public K-12 schools should let down their guard. School security should be at the top of every school adminstrator, both public and private.  If there's anything we've learned from past attacks, it's that a senseless act of violence can happen anywhere, for any reason, and possibly for no reason at all.  School Violence: Private vs. Public  The Council for American Private Education have compiled an array of statistics related to school violence and how public academic organizations compare to their private counterpart.  While this particular organization reports stats that perpetuate the notion that private schools are safer, it’s still a pretty close call.  Also, keep in mind the source of these statistics. Here are a few of the highlights:   Gang Presence: 2% of Private Schools – 19% of Public Schools  Odds of Becoming a Victim of Crime: 2% at Private Schools – 4% at Public Schools  Physical Attack by another Student: 3% at Private Schools – 6% at Public Schools   School Safety Strategies  There are a number of resources and organizations dedicated to helping prevent violence in our schools, such as:   Students Against Violence Everywhere  Keep Schools Safe  National Association of School Psychologists  Center for Disease Control  And many more   There are also several companies working to develop teacher and classroom defenses against mass shooters , as well as improve police response times to school emergencies .

					@@StephenGutowski  August 25, 2017 5:00 am More than a third of parents believe their local school will suffer from a firearm incident in the next three years despite school shootings remaining rare, an upcoming study shows.  Researchers from the University of North Carolina, Ball State University, and the University of Toledo surveyed 257 randomly selected parents from across the country and found that 36 percent thought it was "highly likely" their local high school would experience a gun incident sometime in the next three years. This is despite the fact, as the researchers note, that school shootings are rare. Only 8.6 percent of the parents said they knew of a firearm incident at their local school within the last five years. The study said 95 percent of firearm-related deaths of students occurred outside of school.  The study, Parents’ Expectations of High Schools in Firearm Violence Prevention, is set to be published in an upcoming edition of the Journal of Community Health but is available online .  The study asked parents a number of questions on the root causes of firearm violence inside of schools. Seventy-five percent said bad parenting was a cause, 57.6 percent blamed bullying, 54.1 percent said inadequate mental health care services for young people was a cause, 51 percent blamed easy access to guns, and 51 percent blamed gang activity. Only 10 percent said there was some other cause that played a significant role.  Researchers asked parents what policies would be effective in preventing school shootings as well. Implementing an emergency alert system and working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan were the most popular responses with 70 percent of parents agreeing they'd be very effective. Creating a comprehensive security plan, requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel, implementing an anonymous system for students to report concerns about potential violence, and encouraging parents who own firearms to take action to reduce access to firearms in the home all received more than 65 percent support as well.  Many other policy ideas were seen as far less effective. Installing metal detectors, bullet-proof glass, or conducting random searches of backpacks and lockers all received 35 percent or less support. Training students to collectively attack and subdue a shooter, requiring translucent backpacks, and requiring Kevlar backpacks were the least popular ideas with less than 15 percent of parents labeling them very effective.  The study also polled parents on the most effective measures for reducing firearm violence throughout the United States. Universal background checks at 63.4 percent and increased funding for mental health services at 56.8 percent were the only two proposals that a majority of parents viewed as very effective. Banning "assault weapons" or magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition were viewed as less effective. Increasing government funding for gun violence research was viewed as the least effective.  The researchers said that while parents view gun violence as a major issue, they often don't have a good understanding of what policies might reduce violence in schools.  "Gun violence is a major issue among parents, who often have a limited grasp of potentially effective interventions to reduce such events," Jagdish Khubchandani, an associate professor of health science at Ball State University and one of the study's authors, said in a statement. "Some parents are quick to blame others for a shooting because they have no idea how to stop such incidents from happening. In fact, the study suggests that most parents have a limited knowledge of what works and what doesn’t in preventing these incidents."  The researchers suggest further regulation of firearms is needed, and gun owners and non-gun owners alike need to work together to reduce firearm violence within schools.  "Firearms in the United States are almost as numerous as the population of the United States (317 million)," the study's introduction reads. "If these firearms are not adequately regulated, and currently they are not adequately regulated, they become too easy for untrained, immature youths to access with potentially deadly consequences. Approximately one-third of households with youths younger than 19 years of age have a firearm. In 2015, there were 2,787 firearm deaths of American youths (ages 0–19 years), the majority (59 percent) of which were homicides. All parents, not just firearm owning parents, schools, and various groups in the larger community need to work collaboratively to help reduce the level of firearm violence affecting American youths."  John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and author of The War on Guns , questioned the study's conclusions and said it largely ignores how much gang violence contributes to the problem.  "Even the first sentence of the abstract of this paper gives a misleading impression," Lott told the Washington Free Beacon . "The claim of 2,787 adolescents killed in 2015 by firearm violence ignores that the overwhelming majority of this is gang violence. The CDC puts the number of violence-related firearm deaths for 2015 at 2,687. The number of 17- to 19-year-olds is 1,779, and the vast majority of those are murders. The issues that are listed as the causes have little to do with the problem of drug gang violence in inner cities."  Lott went on to say that during the 2015-2016 school year there were 28 shootings at K through 12 schools in America. He said there are around 140,000 schools in America.  "So, that implies that 0.03 percent of the K-12 public schools in those years had a shooting," Lott said. "Parents clearly have gotten a very misleading understanding of the issues here from the media. And it is also clear that these researchers have no idea of the role that drug gangs have in the subject that they are discussing. The survey questions deal with mass public shootings, and those shootings are just a fraction of the overall school shootings."  He said the study was framed in a manner designed to scare parents away from owning firearms.  "The point about gangs is that these public health researchers want to scare the typical family into not owning guns, when what happens in drug gangs has absolutely no relation to what occurs inside the vast majority of American homes," Lott said.  Khubchandani said that while some of Lott's points on the rarity of school shootings and the impact of media coverage on parental perception were valid, the study was not designed to push gun control.  "When we start writing a study sometimes we cite facts because they are connected to the bigger public health issue," Khubchandani told the Free Beacon . "So, we didn't mean to scare people and parents."  He also pointed out the fact that 58 percent of parents in the study thought assigning a police officer to their local school and 39 percent thought allowing select school personnel to carry firearms would be very effective in preventing gun violence, positions supported by the National Rifle Association.

The suspect, a 19-year-old former student named Nikolas Cruz who was expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons, is in custody, according to officials. As details of the attack emerge, news organizations are engaging in a grim tradition: tallying the massacre on an ever-growing list of school shootings in the U.S., and of mass shootings more generally. The Daily Beast , for example, on Wednesday cited data from Everytown , the gun-control advocacy group, which called it the 59th shooting at or near schools this academic year. But the counting of school shootings, and of other types of shootings and incidents of mass violence, isn’t a straightforward process. Even The Daily Beast ’s reference raises the question of whether reporting ought to distinguish between shootings near schools and those in schools. Meanwhile, many oft-cited statistics disregard forms of school violence that may not have involved guns but are similar to shootings in intention or impact. The messiness of counting school shootings often contributes to sensationalizing or oversimplifying a modern trend of mass violence in America that is seemingly becoming more entrenched. Wednesday’s news out of South Florida has already spurred renewed calls for policy changes and other forms of action to prevent future shootings—but such initiatives are informed by the information that’s available, and currently, that information is confusing at best and inaccurate at worst. Even the federal government defines and counts mass shootings in inconsistent and murky ways. Starting in 2008, the FBI limited its definition of mass shootings to a single incident in which a shooter kills four or more people, according to the criminologist Frederic Lemieux, writing in the Chicago Tribune . But in 2013 the agency decided to rely on a definition for an “active shooter” instead of narrowing in on a definition of “mass shootings”; it defined an “active shooter” as a person “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.” This “active shooter” definition includes incidents in which fewer than four people die. The definition change makes historical study of the issue especially complicated given the variation in what counted as a mass shooting before 2008 and what counts now. Further complicating matters is that, after the 2012 shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, Congress officially defined “mass killings” as three or more killings in a single incident. Twenty schoolchildren were among those murdered in that attack. Definitions are further blurred in journalism and other forms of public discourse. Inconsistent data can compel whomever’s analyzing it to falsely equate school shootings and other kinds of violence, when in reality the nuances of motivation and context might be different. A simple, seemingly straightforward number can grab attention, but exaggerated figures could also risk contributing to the public sense of numbness to shootings that already exists . That numbness poses its own danger—how can the public combat gun violence that it doesn’t truly confront? Separating out different forms of gun violence in the statistics and reporting is crucial in better understanding why shootings happen and how they might be prevented. Coming up with consistent definitions for accurately tracking these incidents can help identify trends and influence policy proposals. In 2015, the Northwestern management-school professor Adam Pah read a headline with a count of the year’s school shootings and realized that he couldn’t objectively fact-check it. Instead, he found lots of contradicting statistics. So Pah set out to create what would become one of the most comprehensive existing databases on school shootings between 1990 and 2013, using three criteria: The incident must involve a gun being discharged, it must involve students or school staff in some way, and it must take place on a school’s premises. He ended up finding a correlation between economic distress and school shootings—the rate of shootings rose and fell in conjunction with that of economic factors such as unemployment and foreclosure. The lack of reliable information on school shootings and other gun-related mass violence isn’t just a matter of inconsistency in definitions; political factors have also played a role in limiting access to information. Under pressure from the National Rifle Association, Congress in 1996 prohibited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding public-health research on issues related to firearms. These prohibitions have largely persisted, and there is still no comprehensive federal database on gun deaths, let alone on school shootings. Still, there’s been progress in the quest for better data. After the deadly Aurora, Colorado, movie-theater shooting, Mother Jones created the first open-source database of mass shootings in the U.S. And the newspaper Education Week last month launched a database that counts school shootings. Each database has its own criteria for what it defines as a mass or school shooting. Mother Jones tallied “indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker,” excluding other gun crimes like armed robbery or gang violence (a decision that was criticized by some as a narrow approach). EdWeek , meanwhile, is tracking “shootings in K-12 schools this year that involve a firearm and result in at least one shooting-related injury or death.” Some members of Congress have publicly lamented Wednesday’s shooting, emphasizing that it’s just the latest example of why political action on gun reform is so critical. Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who was in office at the time of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, said to Congress in a floor speech Wednesday: “We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else. As a parent, it scares me to death that this body doesn't take seriously the safety of my children, and it seems like a lot of parents in South Florida are going to be asking that same question later today.”      Share    Tweet             Latest Video       To Be Inside a Safe Space   A swimming pool becomes a haven for a marginalized community, for whom donning a swimsuit in public can feel unsafe.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

Julie Beck      How centuries of advice columns have answered this and other questions.   The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.

T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                  Kay Nietfeld / AFP / Getty   Silicon Valley Falls to Earth    Franklin Foer      As Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before Congress, the cultural attitude toward technology is dramatically shifting.

Why is fear of them driving policy?                    A police car drives by Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Shootings like the one there are much less common than you may think. (Terry Renna/AP)     By David Ropeik   By David Ropeik   March 8   David Ropeik is an instructor at Harvard and author of "How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts."     The first recorded school shooting in the United States took place in 1840, when a law student shot and killed his professor at the University of Virginia. But the modern fear dawned on April 20, 1999, when Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 12 classmates and a teacher, and then themselves, at Colorado’s Columbine High. Since then, the murder of children in their classrooms has come to seem common, a regular feature of modern American life, and our fears so strong that we are certain the next horror is sure to come not long after the last.  The Education Department reports that   roughly 50 million children attend public schools for roughly 180 days per year. Since Columbine, approximately 200 public school students have been shot to death while school was in session, including the recent slaughter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. (and a shooting in Birmingham, Ala. , on Wednesday that police called accidental that left one student dead). That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was roughly 1 in 614,000,000. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common.  The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low. Not zero — no risk is. But it’s far lower than many people assume, especially in the glare of heart-wrenching news coverage after an event like Parkland. And it’s far lower than almost any other mortality risk a kid faces, including traveling to and from school , catching a potentially deadly disease while in school or suffering a life-threatening injury playing interscholastic sports .  We sometimes seek protection from our fears in ways that put us in greater peril. In responding to the Parkland shooting, we may be doing just that to our kids.  Statistics seem cold and irrelevant compared with how the evil of a school shooting makes us feel. The victims are children, and research on the psychology of risk has found that few risks worry us more than threats to kids. Parents who send their precious children to school each morning are relinquishing control over their safety; that same research has found that lack of control makes any risk feel more threatening. The parents at Columbine and Sandy Hook and Stoneman Douglas placed their faith in the school systems, trust that was cruelly violated — and mistrust fuels fear, too, for the parents and all of us.      Teachers are serving as bodyguards, therapists, soup kitchens and parents. And now we want them to carry guns, too? Wake up, America. We've got a problem. Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah sounds off. (Adriana Usero,Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post)    We don’t really think about risk in terms of 1 in 10, or 1 in 100, or 1 in 1 million in the first place. And when we do see such numbers, the only thing we think is, “My kid could be the one,” so even the tiniest risk appears unacceptably high. That powerful combination of psychological characteristics moots any suggestion that fear of a certain risk is irrationally excessive. Numerically, maybe. Emotionally, not at all.  That’s the thing about risk. We assess it less on the likelihood of the outcome and more on the emotional nature of the experience involved in getting to that outcome. The probability of dying doesn’t matter as much as the way you die. That’s why the infinitesimally low risk of being eaten by a shark scares millions of people out of the ocean, and why vanishingly rare plane crashes scare travelers into their cars and trucks (a statistically riskier way to get around). School shootings also trigger powerful emotions that swamp the odds.   [ Stop fussing over measles vaccination rates. Start worrying about flu shots. ]   And the more frightening a risk feels to you and me, the more coverage it usually gets in the news media, which focuses on things most likely to get our attention. Rare events with high emotional valence often get coverage disproportionate to their likelihood, further magnifying our fears. As a result of what the cognitive sciences call “the awareness heuristic” — a mental shortcut we use to quickly assess the likely frequency of things we don’t know much about — the more readily an event leaps to mind from our memory, or the more persistently it’s in the news, the more emotionally powerful and probable it feels. School shootings and the debate about gun control are prime examples. A threat feels more threatening if it’s getting a lot of attention.    The constant drumbeat of negative news in general — the possibility of nuclear war, terrorism, a bad flu season, hate crimes, climate change — makes the world feel like a darker, more threatening place than it actually is, which makes us more fearful overall. (Media analyst George Gerbner called this “ mean world syndrome .”) School shootings don’t happen in isolation but in the context of worrying news about all sorts of things.  The problem with all of this is what our excessive fears could lead to. Having more guns in schools, as President Trump advocates — or more guns anywhere —   increases the likelihood of gun violence. At a   Georgia high school this month, social studies teacher Randal Davidson locked himself in a classroom and fired his handgun through a window when authorities tried to open the door. In 2014, a Utah teacher carrying a concealed handgun   shot herself in the leg in a school restroom. There are many other similar examples. The Parkland tragedy itself teaches that more guns don’t automatically mean more safety: The school was patrolled by an armed guard.  Another effect of this disproportionate fear is to direct attention to the risks we’re most afraid of and away from those that actually pose the greatest threat. Far more kids are shot outside school than in one — 7,100 a year between 2012 and 2014 , or 19 every day (compared with about 60 shootings at schools each year , according to the Gun Violence Archive). More than 1,000 of them die. Fear focused on military-style “assault” rifles diverts attention from the larger issue of gun control, which has much more to do with the lethality of guns generally than with what the machine looks like.      Pastor Michael McBride, who works to support young people impacted by gun violence, says while he loves the activism of the Parkland students who organized the March for Our Lives, he wishes adults paid more attention to inner-city gun violence. (Gillian Brockell,Kate Woodsome,James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)    Fear also leads us to do things in pursuit of safety that may do more harm than what we’re afraid of in the first place. Think about the psychological effects on kids from all those lessons about when to run, how to hide, directions from their parents to call home if a shooting occurs. A few children have even brought guns to school, saying they wanted to protect their classmates . What happens to children’s ability to learn if they spend their time in the classroom wondering, even if only occasionally, who’s going to burst in and open fire? What does the chronic stress of such worry do to their health? What do constant messages of potential danger in a place that’s supposed to be safe do to their sense of security in the world? Across the population of public school children in the United States, fear of this extraordinarily rare risk is almost certainly doing far more overall harm than have the shootings themselves, horrendous as they are.  An essay like this often concludes with solutions: We should look at the facts and try to keep the risk in perspective. We should worry about statistically bigger threats. We should more rationally weigh the costs and benefits of the ways we try to make schools safer. We should reduce our exposure to dramatic and upsetting news coverage of such events and avoid what might be called “awareness poisoning” by not watching or reading every story for days on end and posting it all on social media.  But all of that is more easily recommended than done. The psychology researchers who study this — Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic, Baruch Fischhoff, Melissa Finucane and many others — are cautious about just how well we can use reason to overcome our instincts and emotions, especially the instincts that evolved to help us survive. Just as surely as there will be another school shooting, it will prompt another flood of outrage and fear. That fear, while understandable, will distract us from greater threats and lead to behaviors that do greater harm. The real lesson we need to learn is this: We need not just reasonable gun control, but also a bit more self-control over our emotions and instincts if we want to keep ourselves and our kids safer.

The odds may surprise you           Dave Mosher and Skye Gould     Feb. 15, 2018, 5:04 PM    40,840          facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link     Shutterstock A 19-year-old gunman allegedly killed 17 people at a Florida high school on Wednesday. Nearly 13,000 people in the US were murdered with firearms in 2015. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC. But research is bootstrapped because of federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. AR-15 rifle that he purchased legally It was the deadliest school shooting in Florida history. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had reportedly been known as a threat to the school, and teachers have bemoaned how they were powerless to stop him. Cruz's victims join a growing number of people in the US intentionally killed at the end of a gun. Below is how the lifetime odds of dying from gun violence (highlighted in red; suicides and accidents excluded) stack up against many causes of death for Americans: Skye Gould/Business Insider Assaults by firearm kill about 13,000 people in the US each year, which translates to a roughly 1-in-315 lifetime chance of death from gun violence. That's about 56% more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a car, truck, or van. It's also more than 11 times as high as dying from any force of nature, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, or lightning strike. These measures also suggest Americans are more likely to die from gun violence than the combined risks of drowning, fire and smoke, stabbing, choking on food, airplane crashes, animal attacks, and natural disasters. Where the data comes from Parents wait for news after a report of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Associated Press/Joel Auerbach The chart above does not account for a person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that could shift the results; it's an average of the entire US population. But it clearly shows that gun violence in the US is a leading cause of death, which is how the CDC describes firearm homicides in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Most of the data comes from an October 2017 report by the National Safety Council and a November 2017 report by the National Center for Health Statistics on causes of death in the US, primarily those that occurred in 2015. (The NSC report uses 2014 data wherever newer data was unavailable.) Mass shootings aren't part of the data sets above, but the Gun Violence Archive project keeps a sourced tally , which we've independently counted. The organization considers any event where four or more victims were injured (regardless of death) to be a mass shooting. In 2015, some 333 mass shootings left 367 people dead and 1,328 injured. The statistics rose in 2016 to 383 mass shootings, 456 deaths, and 1,537 injuries. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings that led to 437 deaths and 1,802 injuries. Foreign-born terrorism data comes from Cato Institute terrorism data , and some natural-disaster data comes from Tulane University . We calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2015 life expectancy and population numbers in the US, and our analysis assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (Mortality data from previous years suggests these rankings are relatively consistent, with the exception of skyrocketing accidental poisonings due to the opioid epidemic. ) You can view our full dataset and sourcing here . A dearth of US gun-violence research Although gun violence is one of the leading causes of death in America, it is also one of the most poorly researched, according to a January 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least-funded cause of death after falls," the study's authors wrote. The study ascribed this dearth of research to restrictions — namely a 21-year-old congressional appropriations bill called the Dickey Amendment that stipulated "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Research into gun violence is the most poorly funded relative to other causes of death. Dr. David E. Stark, Dr. Nigam H. Shah/JAMA This and other federal funding restrictions are still active, hindering many scientists from understanding the problem. "The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done," Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, told Mother Jones in a January 2017 story . "It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources." But what questions have been researched by private institutions like the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a clear connection between gun ownership, gun availability, homicides, and violent death. A roundup of gun-control and gun-violence studies by German Lopez at Vox shows Americans represent less than 5% of the world population but possess nearly 50% of the world's civilian-owned guns, police are about three times more likely to be killed in states with high gun ownership, countries with more guns see more gun deaths , and states with tighter gun control laws see fewer gun-related deaths . This story was updated with the latest final data from CDC, which covers the year 2015. We previously stated that about 11,000 people in the US are killed during firearm assaults; that was a 2014 statistic. In 2015, nearly 13,000 people in the US were killed during firearm assaults.

In order to attempt an answer to that question, let's focus on 2012 first. This year, there have been four shootings at K-12 schools (note: I had to ignore two shootings on US college campuses to come up with this number). Here are the incidents:   1. February 10, 2012: A student shot and killed himself in front of 70 classmates at a public high school in Walpole, New Hampshire.   2. February 12, 2012: A former student killed three students and injured six in a shooting at a public high school in Chadron, Ohio.   3. March 6, 2012: A disgruntled former teacher shot and killed the headmistress of a private religious high school in Jacksonville, Florida.   4. December 14, 2012: 27 people, including the shooter, were killed in a Newtown, Connecticut public elementary school. The shooter also killed one other person at his home prior to going to the school.  But really, how common are school shootings in the United States? Four seems like an excessive number. After culling through the incidents from the last thirteen years, here are the number of US school shootings per year (data from infoplease.com ):   2000 : 4  2001 : 5  2002 : 2  2003 : 3  2004 : 0  2005 : 2  2006 : 4  2007 : 2  2008 : 3  2009 : 0  2010 : 1  2011 : 2  2012 : 4  It appears that 2012 is on the high end, although it is not completely atypical. Taking a strict average over the last thirteen years, the US experiences 2.46 school shootings per year.  It is also interesting to note that these shootings have taken place all over the country and in all regions. There does not seem to be a difference between socioeconomic status or rural/urban setting. However, most school shootings take place at high schools. Of the 32 US school shootings from 2000 through 2012, 23 of them took place in a high school. Only three took place in an elementary school. Five took place in a middle school. One took place in a one-room Amish K-12 schoolhouse.     Now that we have an understanding of the number of school shootings in a given year, we need to know how many schools there are. The best estimate from the Center for Education Reform is that there are about 132,656 K-12 schools, both public and private, in the United States. There are about 99,000 public schools, but I am including private schools in my calculation because a number of the school shootings over the last 13 years took place at private religious schools.  So, what are the odds that a school shooting will occur in your child's school in 2013? If you take the average number of school shootings per year and compare it to the number of schools in the US, you get 2.46:132,656. Reducing that down reveals the following statistic:   The chances of any particular K-12 school in the United States experiencing a shooting incident in any given year is approximately 1 in 53,925 .  Breaking the numbers down a little further reveals the following statistics:   The chances of a school shooting taking place in a US high school in any given year: 1 in 21,000 .   The chances of a school shooting taking place in a US elementary or middle school in any given year: 1 in 141,463 . (data for the number of elementary and middle schools is not separated by agencies keeping track of such numbers)  Please note, this is not a scientific study. I relied on publicly available numbers and a probability statistic calculation that is simple enough to be taught to middle school students. It is obviously much more complicated than I have presented it to be--there are a number of factors that would need to be examined prior to claiming that 1 in 53,925 is wholly accurate. And, not every shooting incident is as horrendous as the one in Newtown, Connecticut. In some shootings, only the shooter died. In other incidents, no one was killed. But, in each incident, at least one gun was fired in a school.  Also keep in mind, your chances of dying in a car crash in 2013 is approximately 1 in 7775, which is about the same as your chances of dying due to any type of gun violence in the next year.   The question we now need to ask ourselves is what is an acceptable level of risk? Are we willing to ride in cars? Are we willing to keep guns around? Are we willing to send our kids to school?  As far as the school shooting question goes, there is extremely little chance your child's school will experience a school shooting incident in 2013. But, we are virtually guaranteed to have a few school shootings somewhere in the US in the next year. It probably won't happen to us. It probably won't happen in our city. It probably won't even happen in our state.  But, it will happen to someone. It seems like we should do something about that, don't you think?

My experience in law enforcement suggests that complacency will be a factor since the probability of a school shooting is low. Armed security guards will not be vigilant and diligent 100% of the time.

Misleading stats make finding a solution to the problem of gun violence that much harder, says David Mastio, deputy editorial page editor. USA TODAY Opinion If you think that our schools are under siege like never before, take a statistical trip back in time. In Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 18, 2018. (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 45 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Correction & clarification: Because of an editing error, Jonesboro, Ark., was mislabeled. With the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., several days gone but hardly forgotten, the time seems right to examine closely some of the statistical hype that made frightening news alongside details of the horrific shooting. In print and on TV, Americans were bombarded with facts and figures suggesting that the problem of school shootings was out of control. We were informed, for example, that since 2013 there has been an average of one school shooting a week in the U.S., and 18 since the beginning of this year. While these statistics were not exactly lies or fake news, they involved stretching the definition of a school shooting well beyond the limits of most people’s imagination. More: No, there have not been 18 school shootings already this year More: We have a right to bear arms. But after the Florida shooting, it's time for conversation. Everytown for Gun Safety reported that there have been 290 school shootings since the catastrophic massacre in Newtown, Conn., more than five years ago. However, very few of these were anything akin to Sandy Hook or Parkland. Sure, they all involved a school of some type (including technical schools and colleges) as well as a firearm, but the outcomes were hardly similar. Nearly half of the 290 were completed or attempted suicides, accidental discharges of a gun, or shootings with not a single individual being injured. Of the remainder, the vast majority involved either one fatality or none at all. It is easy to believe that school shootings are the “new normal” as has been intimated, or that we are facing a crisis of epidemic proportions. When schools are placed on lockdown based on an active shooter alert (which many times is a false alarm), cable news channels immediately inform their viewers of the danger, and word is tweeted and retweeted to millions, most of whom have no direct connection to the event. And when gunshots ring out, we hear the sounds replayed from cellphone recordings and watch through satellite feed as terrified survivors flee the scene. It makes a lasting impression, to be sure. For all those who believe that schools are under siege like never before, it is instructive to take a statistical road trip back in time. Since 1990, there have been 22 shootings at elementary and secondary schools in which two or more people were killed, not counting those perpetrators who committed suicide. Whereas five of these incidents have occurred over the past five-plus years since 2013, claiming the lives of 27 victims (17 at Parkland), the latter half of the 1990s witnessed seven multiple-fatality shootings with a total of 33 killed (13 at Columbine ). In fact, the 1997-98 school year was so awful, with four multiple-fatality shooting sprees at the hands of armed students (in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, Ore.), that then-President Clinton formed a White House expert committee to advise him. Nearly a decade later, President Bush convened a White House Conference on School Safety in the wake of multiple-fatality incidents during his administration. More: Survivor: I will never be OK until we stop school shootings POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Of course, I don’t mean to minimize any of the one-per week on average school shootings, but they should not be conflated with the most deadly but rare events. Unfortunately, most readers and viewers don’t appreciate the distinction when statistics including non-fatal school shootings are cited whenever there is mass killing at a school. Notwithstanding the occasional multiple-fatality shooting that takes place at one of the 100,000 public  schools across America, the nation’s schools are safe. Over the past quarter-century, on average about 10 students are slain in school shootings annually. Compare the school fatality rate with the more than 100 school-age children accidentally killed each year riding their bikes  or walking to school. Congress might be too timid to pass gun legislation to protect children, but how about a national bicycle helmet law for minors? Half of the states do not require them. There is no NRA — National Riding Association — opposing that. I’m all for shielding our kids from harm. But let’s at least deal with the low hanging fruit while we debate and Congress does nothing about the role of guns in school shootings.

By Jason Bedrick   Share Tweet  Like  Submit  Plus      Schools are stocking up on M16s and modified grenade launchers and holding drills involving shooting blanks in middle and high school hallways , but is the risk really worth the expense and possibility of preemptively traumatizing children?  Groups like Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety argue that our nation’s schools are dangerous, claiming that there have been 74 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012 in an infographic that went viral earlier this summer. But a closer look at their numbers revealed that they artificially inflated the statistic by including suicides, accidents, incidents related to criminal activity (e.g. - drug dealing or robbery), and incidents that took place outside of school hours or were unconnected to members of any school community. Moreover, half of those incidents took place on college campuses. Since Sandy Hook, the actual number of K-12 school shootings in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder has been ten—a far cry from the “one school shooting per week” that President Obama claimed back in June.  Surely even one such incident is too high, but with nearly 106,000 public and private schools in the U.S., there were shootings at only 0.009% of schools since December 2012. According to the National Center for Education Statistics’ 2013 “ Indicators of School Crime and Safety ” report, from the 1992-93 school year until the 2010-11 school year, there were between 11 and 34 homicides of youths ages 5-18 at schools each year (including attacks with weapons other than firearms), with an average of about 23 homicides per year. Comparing that to NCES’s enrollment statistics, about 0.000044% of public and private K-12 students were killed at school per year between 1992-93 and 2010-11. That’s about one out of every 2,273,000 students per year. By contrast, the odds of being hit by lightning in a given year is one out of 700,000 according to National Geographic .

School shootings, especially the mass casualty incidents like Sandy Hook, are exceedingly rare. Schools should dispense with the M16s, grenade launchers, and armored vehicles.

Are Private Schools Statistically Safer than Public Schools? January 23, 2018       Tweet                    There’s a great deal of debate when it comes to the comparison of private schools and public K-12 schools. Many families have concerns about safety at public schools - and some have bad reputations that justify those concerns.   Various studies and statistics tend to support the notion that private K-12 schools are statistically safer than public K-12 schools.  Sadly, many of those sending their children to dangerous public schools don't have a choice in the matter - as school assignment is typically based on geography. P rivate school parents can send their children anywhere they want.  Safety Concerns in Schools Today  Public and private academic organizations alike have a lot to deal with these days. School shootings , gangs, crime, drugs, alcohol, discrimination, bullying, misbehavior, physical assault, and even acts of terrorism are just a few of the issues parents and school administrators have to worry about and protect against.  School Shooting Statistics  An active shooter scenario is among the worst of parents’ fears. These acts of violence get a lot of publicity, as they should.  When a tragedy like this occurs, our nation comes together to mourn for those lost. It also gives us the opportunity to bring the issue of school violence to light.  Keeping School Violence in Perspective  While school violence is on many people’s minds, it’s also important to keep things in perspective . Because of mass shootings, people assume kids have a higher degree of risk today than say 20 years ago. Statistically speaking, this isn’t the case.  Few realize the odds of a student being killed at school were 7 times higher in the 1991-1992 school year than they were in the 2010-2011 school term.   The odds of getting struck by lightning are one in 700,000.  The odds of a student being killed at school are one in 2,700,000.   Regardless of the statistics, the loss of even one child to violence is one too many, which is why schools must take precautions and find ways to reduce acts of violence on school grounds.  Are School Shootings More Common at Private Schools or Public K-12 Schools?  A review of the mass school shootings list confirms that most K-12 school shootings have occurred at public institutions. As of 2017, private K-12 academic institutes have been, for the most part, spared from large-scale mass shootings.  However, it’s important to keep in mind that anything could happen in the future .  Neither private nor public K-12 schools should let down their guard. School security should be at the top of every school adminstrator, both public and private.  If there's anything we've learned from past attacks, it's that a senseless act of violence can happen anywhere, for any reason, and possibly for no reason at all.  School Violence: Private vs. Public  The Council for American Private Education have compiled an array of statistics related to school violence and how public academic organizations compare to their private counterpart.  While this particular organization reports stats that perpetuate the notion that private schools are safer, it’s still a pretty close call.  Also, keep in mind the source of these statistics. Here are a few of the highlights:   Gang Presence: 2% of Private Schools – 19% of Public Schools  Odds of Becoming a Victim of Crime: 2% at Private Schools – 4% at Public Schools  Physical Attack by another Student: 3% at Private Schools – 6% at Public Schools   School Safety Strategies  There are a number of resources and organizations dedicated to helping prevent violence in our schools, such as:   Students Against Violence Everywhere  Keep Schools Safe  National Association of School Psychologists  Center for Disease Control  And many more   There are also several companies working to develop teacher and classroom defenses against mass shooters , as well as improve police response times to school emergencies .

					@@StephenGutowski  August 25, 2017 5:00 am More than a third of parents believe their local school will suffer from a firearm incident in the next three years despite school shootings remaining rare, an upcoming study shows.  Researchers from the University of North Carolina, Ball State University, and the University of Toledo surveyed 257 randomly selected parents from across the country and found that 36 percent thought it was "highly likely" their local high school would experience a gun incident sometime in the next three years. This is despite the fact, as the researchers note, that school shootings are rare. Only 8.6 percent of the parents said they knew of a firearm incident at their local school within the last five years. The study said 95 percent of firearm-related deaths of students occurred outside of school.  The study, Parents’ Expectations of High Schools in Firearm Violence Prevention, is set to be published in an upcoming edition of the Journal of Community Health but is available online .  The study asked parents a number of questions on the root causes of firearm violence inside of schools. Seventy-five percent said bad parenting was a cause, 57.6 percent blamed bullying, 54.1 percent said inadequate mental health care services for young people was a cause, 51 percent blamed easy access to guns, and 51 percent blamed gang activity. Only 10 percent said there was some other cause that played a significant role.  Researchers asked parents what policies would be effective in preventing school shootings as well. Implementing an emergency alert system and working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan were the most popular responses with 70 percent of parents agreeing they'd be very effective. Creating a comprehensive security plan, requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel, implementing an anonymous system for students to report concerns about potential violence, and encouraging parents who own firearms to take action to reduce access to firearms in the home all received more than 65 percent support as well.  Many other policy ideas were seen as far less effective. Installing metal detectors, bullet-proof glass, or conducting random searches of backpacks and lockers all received 35 percent or less support. Training students to collectively attack and subdue a shooter, requiring translucent backpacks, and requiring Kevlar backpacks were the least popular ideas with less than 15 percent of parents labeling them very effective.  The study also polled parents on the most effective measures for reducing firearm violence throughout the United States. Universal background checks at 63.4 percent and increased funding for mental health services at 56.8 percent were the only two proposals that a majority of parents viewed as very effective. Banning "assault weapons" or magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition were viewed as less effective. Increasing government funding for gun violence research was viewed as the least effective.  The researchers said that while parents view gun violence as a major issue, they often don't have a good understanding of what policies might reduce violence in schools.  "Gun violence is a major issue among parents, who often have a limited grasp of potentially effective interventions to reduce such events," Jagdish Khubchandani, an associate professor of health science at Ball State University and one of the study's authors, said in a statement. "Some parents are quick to blame others for a shooting because they have no idea how to stop such incidents from happening. In fact, the study suggests that most parents have a limited knowledge of what works and what doesn’t in preventing these incidents."  The researchers suggest further regulation of firearms is needed, and gun owners and non-gun owners alike need to work together to reduce firearm violence within schools.  "Firearms in the United States are almost as numerous as the population of the United States (317 million)," the study's introduction reads. "If these firearms are not adequately regulated, and currently they are not adequately regulated, they become too easy for untrained, immature youths to access with potentially deadly consequences. Approximately one-third of households with youths younger than 19 years of age have a firearm. In 2015, there were 2,787 firearm deaths of American youths (ages 0–19 years), the majority (59 percent) of which were homicides. All parents, not just firearm owning parents, schools, and various groups in the larger community need to work collaboratively to help reduce the level of firearm violence affecting American youths."  John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and author of The War on Guns , questioned the study's conclusions and said it largely ignores how much gang violence contributes to the problem.  "Even the first sentence of the abstract of this paper gives a misleading impression," Lott told the Washington Free Beacon . "The claim of 2,787 adolescents killed in 2015 by firearm violence ignores that the overwhelming majority of this is gang violence. The CDC puts the number of violence-related firearm deaths for 2015 at 2,687. The number of 17- to 19-year-olds is 1,779, and the vast majority of those are murders. The issues that are listed as the causes have little to do with the problem of drug gang violence in inner cities."  Lott went on to say that during the 2015-2016 school year there were 28 shootings at K through 12 schools in America. He said there are around 140,000 schools in America.  "So, that implies that 0.03 percent of the K-12 public schools in those years had a shooting," Lott said. "Parents clearly have gotten a very misleading understanding of the issues here from the media. And it is also clear that these researchers have no idea of the role that drug gangs have in the subject that they are discussing. The survey questions deal with mass public shootings, and those shootings are just a fraction of the overall school shootings."  He said the study was framed in a manner designed to scare parents away from owning firearms.  "The point about gangs is that these public health researchers want to scare the typical family into not owning guns, when what happens in drug gangs has absolutely no relation to what occurs inside the vast majority of American homes," Lott said.  Khubchandani said that while some of Lott's points on the rarity of school shootings and the impact of media coverage on parental perception were valid, the study was not designed to push gun control.  "When we start writing a study sometimes we cite facts because they are connected to the bigger public health issue," Khubchandani told the Free Beacon . "So, we didn't mean to scare people and parents."  He also pointed out the fact that 58 percent of parents in the study thought assigning a police officer to their local school and 39 percent thought allowing select school personnel to carry firearms would be very effective in preventing gun violence, positions supported by the National Rifle Association.

The suspect, a 19-year-old former student named Nikolas Cruz who was expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons, is in custody, according to officials. As details of the attack emerge, news organizations are engaging in a grim tradition: tallying the massacre on an ever-growing list of school shootings in the U.S., and of mass shootings more generally. The Daily Beast , for example, on Wednesday cited data from Everytown , the gun-control advocacy group, which called it the 59th shooting at or near schools this academic year. But the counting of school shootings, and of other types of shootings and incidents of mass violence, isn’t a straightforward process. Even The Daily Beast ’s reference raises the question of whether reporting ought to distinguish between shootings near schools and those in schools. Meanwhile, many oft-cited statistics disregard forms of school violence that may not have involved guns but are similar to shootings in intention or impact. The messiness of counting school shootings often contributes to sensationalizing or oversimplifying a modern trend of mass violence in America that is seemingly becoming more entrenched. Wednesday’s news out of South Florida has already spurred renewed calls for policy changes and other forms of action to prevent future shootings—but such initiatives are informed by the information that’s available, and currently, that information is confusing at best and inaccurate at worst. Even the federal government defines and counts mass shootings in inconsistent and murky ways. Starting in 2008, the FBI limited its definition of mass shootings to a single incident in which a shooter kills four or more people, according to the criminologist Frederic Lemieux, writing in the Chicago Tribune . But in 2013 the agency decided to rely on a definition for an “active shooter” instead of narrowing in on a definition of “mass shootings”; it defined an “active shooter” as a person “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.” This “active shooter” definition includes incidents in which fewer than four people die. The definition change makes historical study of the issue especially complicated given the variation in what counted as a mass shooting before 2008 and what counts now. Further complicating matters is that, after the 2012 shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, Congress officially defined “mass killings” as three or more killings in a single incident. Twenty schoolchildren were among those murdered in that attack. Definitions are further blurred in journalism and other forms of public discourse. Inconsistent data can compel whomever’s analyzing it to falsely equate school shootings and other kinds of violence, when in reality the nuances of motivation and context might be different. A simple, seemingly straightforward number can grab attention, but exaggerated figures could also risk contributing to the public sense of numbness to shootings that already exists . That numbness poses its own danger—how can the public combat gun violence that it doesn’t truly confront? Separating out different forms of gun violence in the statistics and reporting is crucial in better understanding why shootings happen and how they might be prevented. Coming up with consistent definitions for accurately tracking these incidents can help identify trends and influence policy proposals. In 2015, the Northwestern management-school professor Adam Pah read a headline with a count of the year’s school shootings and realized that he couldn’t objectively fact-check it. Instead, he found lots of contradicting statistics. So Pah set out to create what would become one of the most comprehensive existing databases on school shootings between 1990 and 2013, using three criteria: The incident must involve a gun being discharged, it must involve students or school staff in some way, and it must take place on a school’s premises. He ended up finding a correlation between economic distress and school shootings—the rate of shootings rose and fell in conjunction with that of economic factors such as unemployment and foreclosure. The lack of reliable information on school shootings and other gun-related mass violence isn’t just a matter of inconsistency in definitions; political factors have also played a role in limiting access to information. Under pressure from the National Rifle Association, Congress in 1996 prohibited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding public-health research on issues related to firearms. These prohibitions have largely persisted, and there is still no comprehensive federal database on gun deaths, let alone on school shootings. Still, there’s been progress in the quest for better data. After the deadly Aurora, Colorado, movie-theater shooting, Mother Jones created the first open-source database of mass shootings in the U.S. And the newspaper Education Week last month launched a database that counts school shootings. Each database has its own criteria for what it defines as a mass or school shooting. Mother Jones tallied “indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker,” excluding other gun crimes like armed robbery or gang violence (a decision that was criticized by some as a narrow approach). EdWeek , meanwhile, is tracking “shootings in K-12 schools this year that involve a firearm and result in at least one shooting-related injury or death.” Some members of Congress have publicly lamented Wednesday’s shooting, emphasizing that it’s just the latest example of why political action on gun reform is so critical. Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who was in office at the time of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, said to Congress in a floor speech Wednesday: “We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else. As a parent, it scares me to death that this body doesn't take seriously the safety of my children, and it seems like a lot of parents in South Florida are going to be asking that same question later today.”      Share    Tweet             Latest Video       To Be Inside a Safe Space   A swimming pool becomes a haven for a marginalized community, for whom donning a swimsuit in public can feel unsafe.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

Julie Beck      How centuries of advice columns have answered this and other questions.   The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.

T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                  Kay Nietfeld / AFP / Getty   Silicon Valley Falls to Earth    Franklin Foer      As Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before Congress, the cultural attitude toward technology is dramatically shifting.

Why is fear of them driving policy?                    A police car drives by Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Shootings like the one there are much less common than you may think. (Terry Renna/AP)     By David Ropeik   By David Ropeik   March 8   David Ropeik is an instructor at Harvard and author of "How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts."     The first recorded school shooting in the United States took place in 1840, when a law student shot and killed his professor at the University of Virginia. But the modern fear dawned on April 20, 1999, when Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 12 classmates and a teacher, and then themselves, at Colorado’s Columbine High. Since then, the murder of children in their classrooms has come to seem common, a regular feature of modern American life, and our fears so strong that we are certain the next horror is sure to come not long after the last.  The Education Department reports that   roughly 50 million children attend public schools for roughly 180 days per year. Since Columbine, approximately 200 public school students have been shot to death while school was in session, including the recent slaughter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. (and a shooting in Birmingham, Ala. , on Wednesday that police called accidental that left one student dead). That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was roughly 1 in 614,000,000. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common.  The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low. Not zero — no risk is. But it’s far lower than many people assume, especially in the glare of heart-wrenching news coverage after an event like Parkland. And it’s far lower than almost any other mortality risk a kid faces, including traveling to and from school , catching a potentially deadly disease while in school or suffering a life-threatening injury playing interscholastic sports .  We sometimes seek protection from our fears in ways that put us in greater peril. In responding to the Parkland shooting, we may be doing just that to our kids.  Statistics seem cold and irrelevant compared with how the evil of a school shooting makes us feel. The victims are children, and research on the psychology of risk has found that few risks worry us more than threats to kids. Parents who send their precious children to school each morning are relinquishing control over their safety; that same research has found that lack of control makes any risk feel more threatening. The parents at Columbine and Sandy Hook and Stoneman Douglas placed their faith in the school systems, trust that was cruelly violated — and mistrust fuels fear, too, for the parents and all of us.      Teachers are serving as bodyguards, therapists, soup kitchens and parents. And now we want them to carry guns, too? Wake up, America. We've got a problem. Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah sounds off. (Adriana Usero,Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post)    We don’t really think about risk in terms of 1 in 10, or 1 in 100, or 1 in 1 million in the first place. And when we do see such numbers, the only thing we think is, “My kid could be the one,” so even the tiniest risk appears unacceptably high. That powerful combination of psychological characteristics moots any suggestion that fear of a certain risk is irrationally excessive. Numerically, maybe. Emotionally, not at all.  That’s the thing about risk. We assess it less on the likelihood of the outcome and more on the emotional nature of the experience involved in getting to that outcome. The probability of dying doesn’t matter as much as the way you die. That’s why the infinitesimally low risk of being eaten by a shark scares millions of people out of the ocean, and why vanishingly rare plane crashes scare travelers into their cars and trucks (a statistically riskier way to get around). School shootings also trigger powerful emotions that swamp the odds.   [ Stop fussing over measles vaccination rates. Start worrying about flu shots. ]   And the more frightening a risk feels to you and me, the more coverage it usually gets in the news media, which focuses on things most likely to get our attention. Rare events with high emotional valence often get coverage disproportionate to their likelihood, further magnifying our fears. As a result of what the cognitive sciences call “the awareness heuristic” — a mental shortcut we use to quickly assess the likely frequency of things we don’t know much about — the more readily an event leaps to mind from our memory, or the more persistently it’s in the news, the more emotionally powerful and probable it feels. School shootings and the debate about gun control are prime examples. A threat feels more threatening if it’s getting a lot of attention.    The constant drumbeat of negative news in general — the possibility of nuclear war, terrorism, a bad flu season, hate crimes, climate change — makes the world feel like a darker, more threatening place than it actually is, which makes us more fearful overall. (Media analyst George Gerbner called this “ mean world syndrome .”) School shootings don’t happen in isolation but in the context of worrying news about all sorts of things.  The problem with all of this is what our excessive fears could lead to. Having more guns in schools, as President Trump advocates — or more guns anywhere —   increases the likelihood of gun violence. At a   Georgia high school this month, social studies teacher Randal Davidson locked himself in a classroom and fired his handgun through a window when authorities tried to open the door. In 2014, a Utah teacher carrying a concealed handgun   shot herself in the leg in a school restroom. There are many other similar examples. The Parkland tragedy itself teaches that more guns don’t automatically mean more safety: The school was patrolled by an armed guard.  Another effect of this disproportionate fear is to direct attention to the risks we’re most afraid of and away from those that actually pose the greatest threat. Far more kids are shot outside school than in one — 7,100 a year between 2012 and 2014 , or 19 every day (compared with about 60 shootings at schools each year , according to the Gun Violence Archive). More than 1,000 of them die. Fear focused on military-style “assault” rifles diverts attention from the larger issue of gun control, which has much more to do with the lethality of guns generally than with what the machine looks like.      Pastor Michael McBride, who works to support young people impacted by gun violence, says while he loves the activism of the Parkland students who organized the March for Our Lives, he wishes adults paid more attention to inner-city gun violence. (Gillian Brockell,Kate Woodsome,James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)    Fear also leads us to do things in pursuit of safety that may do more harm than what we’re afraid of in the first place. Think about the psychological effects on kids from all those lessons about when to run, how to hide, directions from their parents to call home if a shooting occurs. A few children have even brought guns to school, saying they wanted to protect their classmates . What happens to children’s ability to learn if they spend their time in the classroom wondering, even if only occasionally, who’s going to burst in and open fire? What does the chronic stress of such worry do to their health? What do constant messages of potential danger in a place that’s supposed to be safe do to their sense of security in the world? Across the population of public school children in the United States, fear of this extraordinarily rare risk is almost certainly doing far more overall harm than have the shootings themselves, horrendous as they are.  An essay like this often concludes with solutions: We should look at the facts and try to keep the risk in perspective. We should worry about statistically bigger threats. We should more rationally weigh the costs and benefits of the ways we try to make schools safer. We should reduce our exposure to dramatic and upsetting news coverage of such events and avoid what might be called “awareness poisoning” by not watching or reading every story for days on end and posting it all on social media.  But all of that is more easily recommended than done. The psychology researchers who study this — Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic, Baruch Fischhoff, Melissa Finucane and many others — are cautious about just how well we can use reason to overcome our instincts and emotions, especially the instincts that evolved to help us survive. Just as surely as there will be another school shooting, it will prompt another flood of outrage and fear. That fear, while understandable, will distract us from greater threats and lead to behaviors that do greater harm. The real lesson we need to learn is this: We need not just reasonable gun control, but also a bit more self-control over our emotions and instincts if we want to keep ourselves and our kids safer.
