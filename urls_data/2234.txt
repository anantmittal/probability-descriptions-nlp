Alfred Kinsey shocked the world by announcing that 10% of the male
population is gay. A 1993 Janus Report estimated that nine percent
of men and five percent of women had more than "occasional"
homosexual relationships. The 2000 U.S. Census Bureau found that
homosexual couples constitute less than 1% of American households.
The Family Research Report says "around 2-3% of men, and 2% of
women, are homosexual or bisexual." The National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force estimates three to eight percent of both sexes. So who's
right -- what percentage of the population is homosexual?  It may be that no one will ever know for sure. To some people,
homosexuality is a matter of perception and definition.
Furthermore, many people have trouble admitting their homosexuality
to themselves, much less to a researcher. But when Gallup asked
Americans for their best estimate of the American gay and lesbian
population, the results made all the figures mentioned above look
conservative.  Every Fifth Person -- at Least  In August 2002*, Gallup asked Americans, in an open-ended
format, to estimate the percentage of American men and the
percentage of American women who are homosexual. The average
estimates were that 21% of men are gay and 22% of women are
lesbians. In fact, roughly a quarter of the public thinks more than
25% of men and 25% of women are homosexual. It should be pointed
out, too, that many Americans (at least one in six) could not give
an estimate.  Male respondents tend to give lower estimates of both the male
and female homosexual population than female respondents do. The
average estimates among male respondents are that 16% of men and
21% of women are homosexual. Among female respondents, the average
estimates are that 26% of men and 23% of women are homosexual.
Somewhat interestingly, both sexes believe there are more
homosexuals in the opposite sex than in their own sex.  Portrayals in Pop Culture  Before the 1980s, the few representations of homosexuality in
popular culture tended to consist of potentially dangerous social
deviants (think Norman Bates in Psycho ). Since then,
however, the portrayal of gay characters in pop culture have become
far more numerous and mostly positive. That growing representation
may have spurred growing acceptance -- and inflated population
estimates. In the last 10 years, the number of Americans saying
they feel homosexuality should be considered an acceptable
alternative lifestyle has gone from 38% (June 1992) to 51% (May
2002).  "Seeing ourselves reflected positively encourages gay people to
come out," said Cathy Renna, news media director for the Gay &
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). "And when people know
real gay men and lesbians it increases their level of understanding
and acceptance." If you doubt that Ellen, Rosie and others have had
an effect on Americans' acceptance of homosexuality, consider this
-- MTV and Showtime are about to launch a cable channel directed at
the homosexual market. They estimate that gays and lesbians make up
6.5% of television's audience.  Key Points  Whether increased acceptance of homosexuality has led to an
upsurge in the number of positive media portrayals of gay
characters or vice versa, one result seems to be that Americans now
tend to overestimate the gay population in America. While most
expert estimates place America's homosexual population at 10% or
less, Americans tend to guess that the number is higher, around
20%.  *Results based on telephone interviews with 489 (for those
estimating percentages of lesbian women) and 518 (for those
estimating percentages of gay men) conducted May 6-9, 2002. For
results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence
that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±5%.       Get Articles in Related Topics:  Religion and Social Trends      Subscribe to receive weekly Gallup News alerts.

Photograph: Christopher Ison     F or a single statistic to be the primary propaganda weapon for a radical political movement is unusual. Back in 1977, the US National Gay Task Force (NGTF) was invited into the White House to meet President Jimmy Carter’s representatives – a first for gay and lesbian groups. The NGTF’s most prominent campaigning slogan was “we are everywhere”, backed up by the memorable statistical claim that one in 10 of the US population was gay – this figure was deeply and passionately contested.      Gay Britain: what do the statistics say?           Read more       So where did Bruce Voeller , a scientist who was a founder and first director of the NGTF, get this nice round 10% from? To find out, we have to delve back into Alfred Kinsey’s surveys in 1940s America , which were groundbreaking at the time but are now seen as archaic in their methods: he sought out respondents in prisons and the gay underworld, made friends with them and, over a cigarette, noted down their behaviours using an obscure code. Kinsey did not believe that sexual identity was fixed and simply categorised, and perhaps his most lasting contribution was his scale, still used today, in which individuals are rated from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual on a scale of 0 to 6.  Kinsey’s headline finding was that “at least 37% of the male population has some homosexual experience between the beginning of adolescence and old age”, meaning physical contact to the point of orgasm. He claimed that 13% of males were predominately homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55 (scoring at least 4) and that 4% of males were exclusively homosexual all their lives (scoring 6). For 30-year-old US men, he estimated that 83% would score 0 (totally heterosexual), 8% would be 1 or 2 on the scale, and 9% would be at least a 3. He acknowledged that people could move on the scale during their lifetime, and indeed Kinsey himself is said to have moved from a 1 or 2 when younger to a 3 or 4 in middle age.  When he published his study on women in 1953, Kinsey estimated that 20% of women had had some same-sex experience and 13% to orgasm. In unmarried females between the ages of 20 and 35, he claimed there was at least some homosexual experience in 11%-20%, and 1%-3% were exclusively homosexual.                                     Facebook         Twitter         Pinterest         Alfred Kinsey interviews a woman for one of his sexual behaviour surveys. Photograph: Bill Dellenback/AP   So, in 1973, when Voeller was putting together the NGTF campaign , he went back to Kinsey’s estimates for those with predominantly homosexual experience (4 to 6 on his scale) for at least three years. As this was around 7% for women and 13% for men he took an average to get the headline figure: 10% of the population was gay.  This 10% claim was controversial, to say the least, and reignited old arguments about Kinsey’s poor survey methods. But even cleaned-up data gave similar answers, and Voeller stuck to the 10%, stating in 1990 that “the concept that 10% of the population is gay has become a generally accepted ‘fact’… As with so many pieces of knowledge (and myths), repeated telling made it so.”  This did not stop this figure being strongly disputed by conservatives, who were overjoyed when, in 1991, the US National Survey of Men estimated that only 2.3% of men said that they had not been exclusively heterosexual, while only 1.1% said they had been exclusively homosexual. Statistics had become part of a political battleground, with heated arguments back and forth, but unfortunately without any agreed definition: what was meant by “homosexual”?  When it became necessary to predict what would happen to the Aids epidemic, it was vital to find out what people actually did with each other. It was clear that just asking people their sexuality could give wildly differing answers depending on how people interpreted terms such as “homosexual”, and so a more nuanced approach was adopted. Surveys started to distinguish between identity (what sexual orientation you claim); attraction (who you find sexually attractive); and behaviour (whether you have had same-sex experiences). The numbers for each area turn out to be very different.  Let’s start with sexual identity. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) is the most reliable source of information on what Britons do in private, and has taken place every 10 years since 1990. Natsal-3, from around 2010, asked which “best describes how you think of yourself”: a) heterosexual/straight; b) gay/lesbian; c) bisexual, d) other?  Over an age-range from 16 to 74, 1% of women and 1.5% of men consider themselves gay/lesbian, and 1.4% of women and 1% of men think of themselves as bisexual. But there is a clear gradient with age, with a much higher proportion in younger people, particularly in younger women: the percentage for women between 16 and 24 jumps nearly fourfold.  Sexual identity is also now part of official government statistics. As part of its huge household survey, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found 1.1% reported their identity as gay or lesbian – roughly the same as Natsal. But only 0.4% of respondents reported themselves as bisexual to ONS, around a third that reported to Natsal. So is this evidence of bias in the Natsal participants or a sign of reluctance to open up in a general household survey that is largely concerned with mundane matters such as shopping habits?  I am inclined to go with Natsal, and my judgment would be that roughly one in 80 adults under 75 would consider themselves gay/lesbian and one in 80 bisexual, but with the balance towards bisexual in women. That works out to a total of nearly 1.2 million – the population of Birmingham.                                 Facebook         Twitter         Pinterest         Andrew Wale and Neil Allard after marrying, in Brighton in 2014, in the first legal same-sex wedding in Britain. Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters   There are around 9 million LGBT (lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender) Americans, roughly equivalent to the population of New Jersey, according to a recent US review. But, just as in the UK, the routine US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) comes up with a lower figure for bisexuality than the dedicated sex surveys: it seems plausible that there is less willingness to acknowledge bisexual identity in routine surveys, whereas those who clearly identify themselves as gay or lesbian are willing to be more upfront .  Same-sex sexual behaviour can come in all degrees of intensity. So Natsal carefully distinguishes a “same-sex experience”, which could be just a smooch in the dark, from a “same-sex partner”, who is someone with whom you have had any genital contact intended to achieve orgasm. Respondents are asked about activity at any age, so adolescent fumblings counted.  For women in the age range 16 to 44, the proportion who report having had some same-sex experience has shown a dramatic rise over the past 20 years: from 4% in 1990 to 10% in 2000, and to 16% in 2010 – a massive change in behaviour over such a short period. But this is not all just girls kissing girls in imitation of Madonna and Britney Spears; around half report genital contact, and around half of these in the past five years, so that overall nearly one in 20 women report a same-sex partner in the past five years.         The proportion of people with same-sex experience is higher than the proportion who identify as gay and bisexual    But has there really been a change, or are women simply more willing to report what they get up to? Using some neat cross-checking, Natsal reckons that the change between 1990 and 2000 was partly due to more honest reporting, but the rise in 2000 and 2010 was all real.  And it is clear that there is a lot of experimental activity – roughly, for each woman who has had a recent same-sex partner there are two more of the same age who have had some same-sex contact in their lives, but no partner in the past five years.  Men show a different pattern. In 2010, about 8% of 16- to 44-year-old men reported having had a same-sex experience: this is higher than in 1990, possibly associated with both better reporting and the decline in fear of HIV, but there have been no substantial recent changes.  However, the picture shows a clear peak of lifetime same-sex experience for men aged around 60, and then a dramatic drop in those around 70, a pattern not seen in women. History might provide some explanation: men now aged around 60 were teenagers in the liberating 60s, when homosexuality was legalised, while men who are now around 70 grew up when same-sex male behaviour in men was illegal and frequently prosecuted. Much younger men, meanwhile, would have come to adulthood in the more sober era of HIV.  Overall the proportion of people with same-sex experience is far higher than the proportion who identify themselves as gay and bisexual. This must mean that many same-sex contacts are by people who do not consider themselves gay or bisexual. That’s just what we find in reputable surveys: in the last big US survey, 10% of women and 3% of men who identified themselves as “heterosexual” also reported a same‑sex contact.  Hence the public health world uses the rather clumsy phrase “men who have sex with men” (MSM) rather than “homosexual” or “gay”.  And there is one characteristic that unites female and male same-sex experience: the rates are two to three times higher among those with further education than those with no qualifications.  Along with changes in behaviour, there’s been a consistent shift in attitudes to same-sex partnerships . Natsal has been asking the same questions at 10-year intervals, and the proportion of 16- to 44-year-old women who agree that “same-sex relationships are not wrong at all” has gone up from 28% in 1990 to 66% in 2010 – an extraordinary reversal of opinion over just 20 years. Men are a bit more conservative, but agreement has still more than doubled, from 23% to 50%.  Bruce Voeller didn’t live to see the changes in attitudes he had fought for so hard. He carried on writing academic papers on the history of oral and anal sex, and was at the historic meeting that decided the term “Aids” in 1982 – some recall it was his suggestion. He died aged 59 in 1994 of an Aids-related illness in California.  Yet his legacy lives on. Because, if we consider possible transient same-sex behaviour, his rather wild stat-in-the-dark begins to look rather reasonable. Identity aside, ten per cent of the population, it seems, could well be involved in same sex behaviour after all.

MUST WATCH The science of sexuality  01:07 Story highlights Scientists say mothers who have more than one boy had higher concentrations of a certain protein Earlier studies have noticed that gay men often have older brothers (CNN) If you're a guy with an older brother, there's an increased chance you're gay. Scientists have noticed this pattern in previous research, but now they think they have a biological explanation as to why, and it starts long before birth. The results were published in the journal PNAS on Monday.  The researchers say that if their findings can be replicated, we may know at least one of the biological reasons some men are gay. Many factors may determine someone's sexual orientation,  but in this case, researchers noticed a pattern that may be linked to something that happens in the womb . The phenomenon is related to a protein linked to the Y chromosome (which women do not have) that is important to male brain development. LGBT Rights Milestones Fast Facts Researchers think it's possible that when a woman gets pregnant with her first boy, this Y-linked protein gets into her bloodstream. The mother's body recognizes the protein as a foreign substance, and her immune system responds , creating antibodies. If enough of these antibodies build up in the woman's body and she gets pregnant with another a boy, they can cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the second male fetus. Read More "That may alter the functions in the brain , changing the direction of how the male fetus may later develop their sense of attraction," said study author Anthony Bogaert, a Canadian psychologist and professor in the departments of psychology and community health sciences at Brock University. Earlier research has shown that the more older brothers a boy has, the more of a chance that boy will be attracted to men. A 2006 study showed that with each brother, the chance that a man will be gay goes up by about a third, but the researchers didn't determine why that was. Bogaert and his co-authors tested a small group of 142 women and 12 men ages 18 to 80 and found a higher concentration of antibodies to the protein, known as NLGN4Y , in blood samples from women than from men. They found the highest concentration of antibodies to the protein in women with gay younger sons who had older brothers, compared with women who had no sons or who had given birth to only heterosexual boys. Sun, sex and sculpted timber: How architecture shaped Fire Island Pines The study builds on research Bogaert and his co-authors have been exploring for more than 20 years. Since their initial research that noted the trend, other research -- although not all studies -- have detected the phenomenon, even across cultures . One found that a man's chances of being gay increased even if he was raised apart from his older brother. Researchers did not see a similar pattern in families with adopted brothers , so scientists started to think there must be a maternal developmental explanation. The research does not give  a biological explanation for why some men may be bisexual or may not be attracted to anyone at all, nor can it give a biological explanation for gay only children , gay oldest sons or women who are attracted to women. J. Michael Bailey , a professor in the Department of Psychology at Northwestern University, thinks the latest research is important. "It is significant, and I believe science granting agencies should put a high priority into additional research to see if this is true," he said. Bailey was not involved in the new study but has worked on studies that have found genetic factors that may explain some differences in sexual orientations. Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . Bailey's latest paper, published this month in the journal Nature Research, looked at people's genomes and found several regions  with single-letter DNA changes that were more common among gay men than straight men and may be relevant to the development of sexual orientation. Bailey believes this new study may be even more significant than general genetic findings if the findings can be replicated. "Our studies only show that there may be genes that matter in sexual orientation," he said. "It is not like this study, that shows there is a potential specific mechanism by which sexual orientation may have changed prenatally. This is important work and fascinating if it proves to be true." Clarification: A previous version of this story referred to higher concentrations of the protein instead of higher concentrations of antibodies to the proteins when describing the findings of the study.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

  heterozygous for a simple Mendelian autosomal gene alpha have a child, the probability 
  that the child will show the dominant phenotype is 3/4. Let's ask
  a somewhat more complex question. If this couple has a total of four children, 
  what is the probability that 3 of the 4 will show the dominant phenotype? To 
  answer this, we will first derive the appropriate formula and then use it to 
  calculate the numerical answer. The same formula allows us to understand the 
  expected statistical distribution of the various possible phenotype patterns 
  in four-child ( or any other size) families in a large population.    1. Review: How can some simple overall probabilities be calculated 
  by combining the multiplication and addition "rules" we covered earlier?  Let's start with a very simple case: asking about gender probabilities in families 
  of three children.  What is the probability that all three children in a family will be the same 
  gender? P(all female)= 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all male ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all one gender) = P(all female) + P(all male) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4  What is the probability that a three-child family is two girls and one boy? Each possible birth order has P=1/8. That is, P(G,G,B)=P(G,B,G)=P(B,G,G)=1/8. So, P(2G,1B)= 3/8 and P(1G,2B)= 3/8.  This allows us to write the overall gender probability distribution for families 
  of three children as follows: 1/8 will be three girls 3/8 will be two girls and one boy 3/8 will be one girl and two boys 1/8 will be three boys Adding it all up, we have 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1 (100%)     2. How can we understand and use "Pascal's triangle" 
  and the "general rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities", 
  formula 1 (page 161 in textbook)?  Consider the numerators of the fractions in the above three-child family gender 
  equation: 1 , 3 , 3 , 1. These numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of the term 
  (p + q) cubed. In general, the coefficients of any such binomial expansion { the 
  term (p+q) raised to any power} give the "number of ways" that something 
  can happen.  Figure 4.21, "Pascal's triangle", shows these coefficients for the expansion 
  of (p + q) raised to any power up to 10. The numbers in any row can be used 
  just as described above. For example, assume that over the next two decades 
  you have 6 kids. There are 64 possible gender birth orders, with 20 of these 
  resulting in you having three girls and three boys.  The terms p and q are the individual probabilities for a specific outcome from 
  a single "event". For "gender" calculations, the probabilities p and 
  q are equal, both = 1/2 (the equal probabilities of male and female births).  For "dominant : recessive phenotype" type of calculations, p and q will usually 
  not be equal. For a simple Mendelian inheritance from two heterozygotic parents, 
  p will = 3/4 (if AA and Aa give dominant phenotype) and q will 
  = 1/4 ( aa gives recessive phenotype).  Generalizing this, we get to the formula on page 161 in your text that is "the general 
  rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities". The term (n!/s!t!) 
  is the number of possible ways (orders) of getting a certain net outcome ( "a 
  total of n ; with s of one and t of the other"). This 
  number can either be calculated or taken directly from Pascal's triangle.    3. Sample problem: You and your mate are both heterozygous 
  for some simple Mendelian gene alpha (i.e., each of you has genotype Aa , and both of you show the dominant phenotype) on chromosome #1. Over 
  the next decade, you proceed to have four children. What is the probability 
  that 3 of your children will show the dominant phenotype and one will show the 
  recessive phenotype? What are the probabilities of the other possible outcomes?  If we were looking at thousands of such families, we know that the overall ratio 
  of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the children would average out to 3:1, 
  as shown by a simple Punnett square. But for one couple having four children, 
  what's the probability, P(3D,1r)?  To calculate P(3D,1r), we use formula 1 for the case n=4, s=3, t=1, p=3/4, 
  q=1/4. P(3D,1r)= 4!/3! x (3/4)cubed x (1/4) = 4 x (27/64) x 1/4 = .42 ( 42% )  By also calculating the other four possibilities, we can construct a graph that shows the statistical distribution you would expect 
  to see in a large population.      Problem S-4: "Heterozygous parents; have three children".  Modify the sample problem above to do the calculations for you and your mate (both Aa ) having THREE children. Do the calculations for the probabilities that all three, two, one, or none of the three children will show the dominant phenotype from gene alpha . Construct the graph and compare the result with the "four children" graph done in class.  5��-W�M�� *�+�P+��������&i���̄�/��M�f�XA�tǰ.� 8/s���:

More Than You Think  There may never be a time when people will accurately answer surveys, but at least survey givers are getting better at tricking us into being honest  (Kellie Parker)    By Rose Eveleth    smithsonian.com   October 24, 2013         What percentage of the population considers themselves gay? This number has always been hard to pin down: sexuality is fluid, and plenty of people still feel pressured to hide their sexual orientation. But a new study has tried, and come up with a number that’s higher than most.    According to a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research , about 20 percent of the population is attracted to their own gender. That’s nearly double the usual estimates of about 10 percent. The authors explain that their methodology might have something to do with it:   Participants were randomly assigned to either a “best practices method” that was computer-based and provides privacy and anonymity, or to a “veiled elicitation method” that further conceals individual responses. Answers in the veiled method preclude inference about any particular individual, but can be used to accurately estimate statistics about the population. Comparing the two methods shows sexuality-related questions receive biased responses even under current best practices, and, for many questions, the bias is substantial. The veiled method increased self-reports of non-heterosexual identity by 65% (p<0.05) and same-sex sexual experiences by 59% (p<0.01). The veiled method also increased the rates of anti-gay sentiment. Respondents were 67% more likely to express disapproval of an openly gay manager at work (p<0.01) and 71% more likely to say it is okay to discriminate against lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals (p<0.01).   Essentially, using a veiled question rather than a direct one uncovered a whole group of people who would not directly say they weren’t heterosexual. This kind of veiled questioning can get at all sorts of answers that people don’t want to give, like the incidence of rape . Daniel Luzer at Pacific Standard explains that uncovering these hidden biases is really important for understanding how accurate these kinds of surveys actually are:   The most important takeaway isn’t a final tally of the gay people in society, but, rather, an understanding of the ways in which surveys and other existing attempts to measure such things might be slightly misleading. “The results show non-heterosexuality and anti-gay sentiment are substantially underestimated in existing surveys, and the privacy afforded by current best practices is not always sufficient to eliminate bias,” note the researchers, who were just looking at the way surveys might under-count both homosexuality and attitudes toward homosexuality.   There may never be a time when people will accurately answer surveys, but at least survey givers are getting better at tricking us into being honest.

Since the quotient $G/Z(G)$ cannot be nontrivial cyclic, these two cases cover all bases. Let $Z=Z(G)$.  $\rm\color{Blue}{(i)}$: Write $G=Z\sqcup aZ\sqcup bZ\sqcup cZ$. Check $C_G(g)=Z\cup aZ$ for $g\in aZ$, and similarly for the other two cosets $bZ$ and $cZ$, while of course $C_G(g)=G$ if $g\in Z$. Use $[\Omega]$ for the Iverson bracket (i.e. $[\Omega]=1$ if $\Omega$ is true, and $[\Omega]=0$ otherwise). Calculate  $$P=\frac{1}{|G\times G|}\sum_{a\in G}\sum_{b\in G}[ab=ba]=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{a\in G}|C_G(a)|=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\sum_{a\in Z}|G|+\sum_{a\in G\setminus Z}\frac{|G|}{2}\right)$$  $$=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(|Z||G|+|G\setminus Z|\frac{|G|}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\frac{|G|}{4}|G|+\frac{3|G|}{4}\frac{|G|}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{8}.$$  $\rm\color{Blue}{(ii)}$: Start the same way as above, writing  $$P=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{a\in G}|C_G(a)|=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\sum_{a\in Z}|G|+\sum_{a\in G\setminus Z}|C_G(a)|\right).$$  Using $|Z|\le|G|/6$ and $|C_G(a)|\le|G|/2$, we obtain the upper bound  $$P\le\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(|G||Z|+\big(|G|-|Z|\big)\frac{|G|}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\frac{|G|^2}{2}+|Z|\frac{|G|}{2}\right)\le\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{7}{12}.$$  Note $7/12<5/8$. Therefore, we have proven:  Theorem . $P>\frac{5}{8}$ iff $G$ is abelian, $P=\frac{5}{8}$ iff $G/Z(G)$ is Klein-$4$, and $P\le\frac{7}{12}$ otherwise.  There are a couple slick character-theoretic proofs on mathoverflow, as well as forcing probabilities for solvability, nilpotence and odd cardinality. Note the $5/8$ bound is true for compact topological groups , where we pick $(a,b)\in G\times G$ according to the normalized Haar measure. One formula for the commuting probability $P$ that I didn't discuss above is as follows:  $$P=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{a\in G}|C_G(a)|=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{a\in G}\frac{1}{[G:C_G(a)]}=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{a\in C_i}\frac{1}{|C_i|}=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{|C_i|}{|C_i|}=\frac{k}{|G|},$$  where $C_1,\cdots,C_k$ are the conjugacy classes of $G$ and $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:58       Community ♦   1        answered Jun 24 '14 at 19:54       blue   12.9k 22 41              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

The findings, reported this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, by Anthony Bogaert of Brock University, lend credence to the theory that it's not the social or rearing factors that influence a man's sexual orientation, but rather prenatal mechanisms that begin in the womb. The idea that prenatal mechanisms may influence sexual orientation has been around for a couple of decades. In 1996, Bogaert along with colleague Ray Blanchard correlated sexual orientation in men with the number of older brothers, but it wasn't clear if that influence was occurring because the boys shared the same household or because they had shared the same womb. In the new study, Bogaert pitted prenatal against postnatal by examining four samples of homosexual and heterosexual men, for a total of 944 participants. The data for three of the samples had been collected previously, and included detailed information about the men's sexual orientation, as well as their family life. Because most of the men from these three study groups came from unbroken families, Bogaert looked at a fourth group, composed of men who had been adopted or raised with half- or step-siblings. He also gathered data from this group about how long members lived with each sibling and whether they had brothers or sisters with whom they had never lived. He reasoned that if the social or rearing factor theories were correct, he would expect to see certain things. First, it wouldn't matter whether a gay man's older brothers had been biologically related or not, the social influence would be there. Second, the amount of time the young boy lived with his older brothers, biological or not, should affect his sexual orientation. Third, if the boy did not live with older brothers, then the numbers should not impact his sexual preference. Bogaert found the opposite to be true. First, he found that only the number of biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men--even when the number of non-biological older brothers was significantly higher. Second, his study showed that the amount of time reared with older brothers--either related or not--did not predict a young boy's becoming homosexual. And surprisingly, Bogaert discovered that even if a young man did not grow up in the same house as his older brothers, the fact that he had older biological brothers increased his odds of being gay. The fact that the common denominator between the older and younger biological brothers is the mother hints at a prenatal influence on sexual orientation. What it could be is still a mystery. But one theory suggests that after delivering a boy, a woman's immune system produces antibodies to male-specific proteins. During subsequent pregnancies the mother's placenta may deliver the antibodies to the fetus, possibly affecting its development.

Alfred Kinsey shocked the world by announcing that 10% of the male
population is gay. A 1993 Janus Report estimated that nine percent
of men and five percent of women had more than "occasional"
homosexual relationships. The 2000 U.S. Census Bureau found that
homosexual couples constitute less than 1% of American households.
The Family Research Report says "around 2-3% of men, and 2% of
women, are homosexual or bisexual." The National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force estimates three to eight percent of both sexes. So who's
right -- what percentage of the population is homosexual?  It may be that no one will ever know for sure. To some people,
homosexuality is a matter of perception and definition.
Furthermore, many people have trouble admitting their homosexuality
to themselves, much less to a researcher. But when Gallup asked
Americans for their best estimate of the American gay and lesbian
population, the results made all the figures mentioned above look
conservative.  Every Fifth Person -- at Least  In August 2002*, Gallup asked Americans, in an open-ended
format, to estimate the percentage of American men and the
percentage of American women who are homosexual. The average
estimates were that 21% of men are gay and 22% of women are
lesbians. In fact, roughly a quarter of the public thinks more than
25% of men and 25% of women are homosexual. It should be pointed
out, too, that many Americans (at least one in six) could not give
an estimate.  Male respondents tend to give lower estimates of both the male
and female homosexual population than female respondents do. The
average estimates among male respondents are that 16% of men and
21% of women are homosexual. Among female respondents, the average
estimates are that 26% of men and 23% of women are homosexual.
Somewhat interestingly, both sexes believe there are more
homosexuals in the opposite sex than in their own sex.  Portrayals in Pop Culture  Before the 1980s, the few representations of homosexuality in
popular culture tended to consist of potentially dangerous social
deviants (think Norman Bates in Psycho ). Since then,
however, the portrayal of gay characters in pop culture have become
far more numerous and mostly positive. That growing representation
may have spurred growing acceptance -- and inflated population
estimates. In the last 10 years, the number of Americans saying
they feel homosexuality should be considered an acceptable
alternative lifestyle has gone from 38% (June 1992) to 51% (May
2002).  "Seeing ourselves reflected positively encourages gay people to
come out," said Cathy Renna, news media director for the Gay &
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). "And when people know
real gay men and lesbians it increases their level of understanding
and acceptance." If you doubt that Ellen, Rosie and others have had
an effect on Americans' acceptance of homosexuality, consider this
-- MTV and Showtime are about to launch a cable channel directed at
the homosexual market. They estimate that gays and lesbians make up
6.5% of television's audience.  Key Points  Whether increased acceptance of homosexuality has led to an
upsurge in the number of positive media portrayals of gay
characters or vice versa, one result seems to be that Americans now
tend to overestimate the gay population in America. While most
expert estimates place America's homosexual population at 10% or
less, Americans tend to guess that the number is higher, around
20%.  *Results based on telephone interviews with 489 (for those
estimating percentages of lesbian women) and 518 (for those
estimating percentages of gay men) conducted May 6-9, 2002. For
results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence
that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±5%.       Get Articles in Related Topics:  Religion and Social Trends      Subscribe to receive weekly Gallup News alerts.

Photograph: Christopher Ison     F or a single statistic to be the primary propaganda weapon for a radical political movement is unusual. Back in 1977, the US National Gay Task Force (NGTF) was invited into the White House to meet President Jimmy Carter’s representatives – a first for gay and lesbian groups. The NGTF’s most prominent campaigning slogan was “we are everywhere”, backed up by the memorable statistical claim that one in 10 of the US population was gay – this figure was deeply and passionately contested.      Gay Britain: what do the statistics say?           Read more       So where did Bruce Voeller , a scientist who was a founder and first director of the NGTF, get this nice round 10% from? To find out, we have to delve back into Alfred Kinsey’s surveys in 1940s America , which were groundbreaking at the time but are now seen as archaic in their methods: he sought out respondents in prisons and the gay underworld, made friends with them and, over a cigarette, noted down their behaviours using an obscure code. Kinsey did not believe that sexual identity was fixed and simply categorised, and perhaps his most lasting contribution was his scale, still used today, in which individuals are rated from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual on a scale of 0 to 6.  Kinsey’s headline finding was that “at least 37% of the male population has some homosexual experience between the beginning of adolescence and old age”, meaning physical contact to the point of orgasm. He claimed that 13% of males were predominately homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55 (scoring at least 4) and that 4% of males were exclusively homosexual all their lives (scoring 6). For 30-year-old US men, he estimated that 83% would score 0 (totally heterosexual), 8% would be 1 or 2 on the scale, and 9% would be at least a 3. He acknowledged that people could move on the scale during their lifetime, and indeed Kinsey himself is said to have moved from a 1 or 2 when younger to a 3 or 4 in middle age.  When he published his study on women in 1953, Kinsey estimated that 20% of women had had some same-sex experience and 13% to orgasm. In unmarried females between the ages of 20 and 35, he claimed there was at least some homosexual experience in 11%-20%, and 1%-3% were exclusively homosexual.                                     Facebook         Twitter         Pinterest         Alfred Kinsey interviews a woman for one of his sexual behaviour surveys. Photograph: Bill Dellenback/AP   So, in 1973, when Voeller was putting together the NGTF campaign , he went back to Kinsey’s estimates for those with predominantly homosexual experience (4 to 6 on his scale) for at least three years. As this was around 7% for women and 13% for men he took an average to get the headline figure: 10% of the population was gay.  This 10% claim was controversial, to say the least, and reignited old arguments about Kinsey’s poor survey methods. But even cleaned-up data gave similar answers, and Voeller stuck to the 10%, stating in 1990 that “the concept that 10% of the population is gay has become a generally accepted ‘fact’… As with so many pieces of knowledge (and myths), repeated telling made it so.”  This did not stop this figure being strongly disputed by conservatives, who were overjoyed when, in 1991, the US National Survey of Men estimated that only 2.3% of men said that they had not been exclusively heterosexual, while only 1.1% said they had been exclusively homosexual. Statistics had become part of a political battleground, with heated arguments back and forth, but unfortunately without any agreed definition: what was meant by “homosexual”?  When it became necessary to predict what would happen to the Aids epidemic, it was vital to find out what people actually did with each other. It was clear that just asking people their sexuality could give wildly differing answers depending on how people interpreted terms such as “homosexual”, and so a more nuanced approach was adopted. Surveys started to distinguish between identity (what sexual orientation you claim); attraction (who you find sexually attractive); and behaviour (whether you have had same-sex experiences). The numbers for each area turn out to be very different.  Let’s start with sexual identity. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) is the most reliable source of information on what Britons do in private, and has taken place every 10 years since 1990. Natsal-3, from around 2010, asked which “best describes how you think of yourself”: a) heterosexual/straight; b) gay/lesbian; c) bisexual, d) other?  Over an age-range from 16 to 74, 1% of women and 1.5% of men consider themselves gay/lesbian, and 1.4% of women and 1% of men think of themselves as bisexual. But there is a clear gradient with age, with a much higher proportion in younger people, particularly in younger women: the percentage for women between 16 and 24 jumps nearly fourfold.  Sexual identity is also now part of official government statistics. As part of its huge household survey, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found 1.1% reported their identity as gay or lesbian – roughly the same as Natsal. But only 0.4% of respondents reported themselves as bisexual to ONS, around a third that reported to Natsal. So is this evidence of bias in the Natsal participants or a sign of reluctance to open up in a general household survey that is largely concerned with mundane matters such as shopping habits?  I am inclined to go with Natsal, and my judgment would be that roughly one in 80 adults under 75 would consider themselves gay/lesbian and one in 80 bisexual, but with the balance towards bisexual in women. That works out to a total of nearly 1.2 million – the population of Birmingham.

But, just as in the UK, the routine US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) comes up with a lower figure for bisexuality than the dedicated sex surveys: it seems plausible that there is less willingness to acknowledge bisexual identity in routine surveys, whereas those who clearly identify themselves as gay or lesbian are willing to be more upfront .  Same-sex sexual behaviour can come in all degrees of intensity. So Natsal carefully distinguishes a “same-sex experience”, which could be just a smooch in the dark, from a “same-sex partner”, who is someone with whom you have had any genital contact intended to achieve orgasm. Respondents are asked about activity at any age, so adolescent fumblings counted.  For women in the age range 16 to 44, the proportion who report having had some same-sex experience has shown a dramatic rise over the past 20 years: from 4% in 1990 to 10% in 2000, and to 16% in 2010 – a massive change in behaviour over such a short period. But this is not all just girls kissing girls in imitation of Madonna and Britney Spears; around half report genital contact, and around half of these in the past five years, so that overall nearly one in 20 women report a same-sex partner in the past five years.         The proportion of people with same-sex experience is higher than the proportion who identify as gay and bisexual    But has there really been a change, or are women simply more willing to report what they get up to? Using some neat cross-checking, Natsal reckons that the change between 1990 and 2000 was partly due to more honest reporting, but the rise in 2000 and 2010 was all real.  And it is clear that there is a lot of experimental activity – roughly, for each woman who has had a recent same-sex partner there are two more of the same age who have had some same-sex contact in their lives, but no partner in the past five years.  Men show a different pattern. In 2010, about 8% of 16- to 44-year-old men reported having had a same-sex experience: this is higher than in 1990, possibly associated with both better reporting and the decline in fear of HIV, but there have been no substantial recent changes.  However, the picture shows a clear peak of lifetime same-sex experience for men aged around 60, and then a dramatic drop in those around 70, a pattern not seen in women. History might provide some explanation: men now aged around 60 were teenagers in the liberating 60s, when homosexuality was legalised, while men who are now around 70 grew up when same-sex male behaviour in men was illegal and frequently prosecuted. Much younger men, meanwhile, would have come to adulthood in the more sober era of HIV.  Overall the proportion of people with same-sex experience is far higher than the proportion who identify themselves as gay and bisexual. This must mean that many same-sex contacts are by people who do not consider themselves gay or bisexual. That’s just what we find in reputable surveys: in the last big US survey, 10% of women and 3% of men who identified themselves as “heterosexual” also reported a same‑sex contact.  Hence the public health world uses the rather clumsy phrase “men who have sex with men” (MSM) rather than “homosexual” or “gay”.  And there is one characteristic that unites female and male same-sex experience: the rates are two to three times higher among those with further education than those with no qualifications.  Along with changes in behaviour, there’s been a consistent shift in attitudes to same-sex partnerships . Natsal has been asking the same questions at 10-year intervals, and the proportion of 16- to 44-year-old women who agree that “same-sex relationships are not wrong at all” has gone up from 28% in 1990 to 66% in 2010 – an extraordinary reversal of opinion over just 20 years. Men are a bit more conservative, but agreement has still more than doubled, from 23% to 50%.  Bruce Voeller didn’t live to see the changes in attitudes he had fought for so hard. He carried on writing academic papers on the history of oral and anal sex, and was at the historic meeting that decided the term “Aids” in 1982 – some recall it was his suggestion. He died aged 59 in 1994 of an Aids-related illness in California.  Yet his legacy lives on. Because, if we consider possible transient same-sex behaviour, his rather wild stat-in-the-dark begins to look rather reasonable. Identity aside, ten per cent of the population, it seems, could well be involved in same sex behaviour after all.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED The science of sexuality Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The science of sexuality  01:07 Story highlights Scientists say mothers who have more than one boy had higher concentrations of a certain protein Earlier studies have noticed that gay men often have older brothers (CNN) If you're a guy with an older brother, there's an increased chance you're gay. Scientists have noticed this pattern in previous research, but now they think they have a biological explanation as to why, and it starts long before birth. The results were published in the journal PNAS on Monday.  The researchers say that if their findings can be replicated, we may know at least one of the biological reasons some men are gay. Many factors may determine someone's sexual orientation,  but in this case, researchers noticed a pattern that may be linked to something that happens in the womb . The phenomenon is related to a protein linked to the Y chromosome (which women do not have) that is important to male brain development. LGBT Rights Milestones Fast Facts Researchers think it's possible that when a woman gets pregnant with her first boy, this Y-linked protein gets into her bloodstream. The mother's body recognizes the protein as a foreign substance, and her immune system responds , creating antibodies. If enough of these antibodies build up in the woman's body and she gets pregnant with another a boy, they can cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the second male fetus. Read More "That may alter the functions in the brain , changing the direction of how the male fetus may later develop their sense of attraction," said study author Anthony Bogaert, a Canadian psychologist and professor in the departments of psychology and community health sciences at Brock University. Earlier research has shown that the more older brothers a boy has, the more of a chance that boy will be attracted to men. A 2006 study showed that with each brother, the chance that a man will be gay goes up by about a third, but the researchers didn't determine why that was. Bogaert and his co-authors tested a small group of 142 women and 12 men ages 18 to 80 and found a higher concentration of antibodies to the protein, known as NLGN4Y , in blood samples from women than from men. They found the highest concentration of antibodies to the protein in women with gay younger sons who had older brothers, compared with women who had no sons or who had given birth to only heterosexual boys. Sun, sex and sculpted timber: How architecture shaped Fire Island Pines The study builds on research Bogaert and his co-authors have been exploring for more than 20 years. Since their initial research that noted the trend, other research -- although not all studies -- have detected the phenomenon, even across cultures . One found that a man's chances of being gay increased even if he was raised apart from his older brother. Researchers did not see a similar pattern in families with adopted brothers , so scientists started to think there must be a maternal developmental explanation. The research does not give  a biological explanation for why some men may be bisexual or may not be attracted to anyone at all, nor can it give a biological explanation for gay only children , gay oldest sons or women who are attracted to women. J. Michael Bailey , a professor in the Department of Psychology at Northwestern University, thinks the latest research is important. "It is significant, and I believe science granting agencies should put a high priority into additional research to see if this is true," he said. Bailey was not involved in the new study but has worked on studies that have found genetic factors that may explain some differences in sexual orientations. Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . Bailey's latest paper, published this month in the journal Nature Research, looked at people's genomes and found several regions  with single-letter DNA changes that were more common among gay men than straight men and may be relevant to the development of sexual orientation. Bailey believes this new study may be even more significant than general genetic findings if the findings can be replicated. "Our studies only show that there may be genes that matter in sexual orientation," he said. "It is not like this study, that shows there is a potential specific mechanism by which sexual orientation may have changed prenatally. This is important work and fascinating if it proves to be true." Clarification: A previous version of this story referred to higher concentrations of the protein instead of higher concentrations of antibodies to the proteins when describing the findings of the study.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

Ray Blanchard identified the association and referred to it as the fraternal birth order effect . In several studies, the observation is that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual  orientation . [1] It has sometimes been called the older brother effect . It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.

[3] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail. [4] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to an excess of older brothers and not older sisters. [5] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%. [5] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base". [6] [7] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect . [8]  Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers. [9] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%. [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds. [9] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [16] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women. [17] [18]  Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence. [7] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation. [3] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness , [19] [7] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males. [18] [20] [21] [19] Since handedness develops prenatally, [22] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect. [7] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers. [23] [24] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation. [25]  Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different races, [26] different cultures, [27] different historical eras, [5] [28] and widely separated geographic regions. [9] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [9] [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience [5] [30] and representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Empirical findings [ edit ]  Biodemographics [ edit ]  The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways: [34] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men. [9] [35] [7] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers / All Siblings ) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males. [9] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers / Other Siblings ) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males. [9]  After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers. [14] [9] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect. [5] [11] [7] [9] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters). [5] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers. [5] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding. [11]  In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B. [1] [29] These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect. [29] [36] When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies. [27] [29] Various studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality: [35] [29]   A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers. [37] [35] [9]  A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers. [35] [9] The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators. [35]  A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies. [29] [36]   The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential confounds such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status. [7] It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). [9] Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful. [9] [18] [38] [39] [40]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth. [11] [35] This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively. [5]  The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical. [41]  No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation. [7]  Quantitative findings [ edit ]  Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual. [5] [16] [15] The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. [16] [15] [note 2] Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively. [14]  Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1% [16] to 28.6%. [42] The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1 in 7 gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [11] [16] Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect. [35] They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers. [16] Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain polymorphic genes (colloquially called "gay genes" ) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development. [11] [35] [43]  Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings. [7] Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life. [35]  Birth weight [ edit ]     A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the body weight of a baby at birth . [44]    The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers. [11] The study yielded three main observations:   The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;  The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and:  The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.   Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies [35] [24] [45] [46] (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies). [47] [48] [35] These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., in utero ). [11] [35] It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers. [49] [36]  Handedness [ edit ]     Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.    Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men. [20] [7] Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect. [28] [7] The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research. [19] [18] [7] As handedness is developed during prenatal life, [22] [7] this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers. [7]  Biological vs. non-biological older brothers [ edit ]  Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined. [3] [49]  If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men. [3]  Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect. [3]  Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers. [3]  In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men [3] [7] [49] and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male gestations (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus). [3] So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.  Ubiquity [ edit ]  The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times. [7] One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types. [36] The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers. [40] [39] [36]  The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races, [26] including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian. [27] The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras, [5] [28] ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago. [7] [27] [35]  The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males. [50] Retrospective studies conducted in Brazil, Guatemala, Independent Samoa, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey have found that the same is true of homosexual males raised in these non-Western cultures. [51] [52] [53] [54] Such cross-cultural similarities in childhood behavior support the idea that similar biological influences, which transcend cultural differences, play a role in the development of male homosexuality. This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males. [27]  The fraternal birth order effect has also been demonstrated in widely separated geographic regions and in countries such as Brazil, [36] Canada, [6] Finland, [29] Iran, [9] Italy, [55] The Netherlands, [56] Independent Samoa, [27] Spain, [57] Turkey, [58] the United Kingdom, [59] and the United States. [60] The effect has additionally been observed in participants examined during childhood as well as adulthood [56] [49] [29] and in patients as well as in non-patient volunteers. [27] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated by Blanchard and colleagues as well as by independent researchers. [31] [55] [59] [13] [60] [61] [62] [30] [27] The demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect in meta-analysis of studies by Blanchard and colleagues, [35] [29] meta-analysis of studies by independent investigators [29] and studies by both Blanchard and other investigators shows that studies of the fraternal birth order effect have been free from experimenter bias . [29] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience samples [5] [30] and in representative, national probability samples. [31] [32] [33]  Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are cisgender and attracted to adult men). [1] [63] Two chromosomally male groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., transgender chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males). [64] [63]  The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals"). This has been reported in samples from Canada, [65] the United Kingdom, [61] the Netherlands, [66] and Polynesia. [67]  Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males. [63] One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters. [68] Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls. [64] The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by selection bias . The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information. [63]  Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of gynephilic men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults). [63] The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself. [11] [63]  Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not. [63] [69] [70] To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls. [1] [63]  The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males. [63]  Other findings [ edit ]  Bearman and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation. Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters". [71] A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters). [72]  The failure of these studies to demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect has been attributed to their methodological flaws. [46] Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. [49] The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. [49] Ray Blanchard explained that the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. [49] [34] [note 3] Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. [49] Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. [49] [34] Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect. [31] [42]  Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.  To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group. [15] To assess sexual fantasy, participants were asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve men?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. Each participant was also asked "What percent of your sexual fantasies during masturbation involve women?" and rated the question from 0% to 100%. If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups. [15] A 2017 meta-analysis analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect. [9]  Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism [ edit ]  Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers. An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect. [11] [5] [35] [73] Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which may be involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates. [73]  McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two. [74] However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally. [3] [7] [20] [75] [76] It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning. [76]  See also [ edit ]   Biology and sexual orientation  Birth order  Handedness and sexual orientation  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation   Notes [ edit ]     ^  The naturally occurring odds of a male child (with no older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%. Due to the fraternal birth order effect, those naturally occurring odds are increased to 2.6% in a male child with one older brother; a male child with two older brothers will have a 3.5% chance of being homosexual; with three, and four older brothers, the chances are increased to 4.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. [14] [15] [11]  ^  This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%. [42] [35]  ^  According to Ray Blanchard , the demonstrability of the fraternal birth order effect partly depends upon proper matching of homosexual and heterosexual study groups with respect to mean family size. If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)." [34] Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups. In the third part of the article, Blanchard surveyed studies about fraternal birth order and found two studies that did not demonstrate the fraternal birth order effect in their homosexual groups. In both studies, the collective findings for older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters as well as individual findings for the four sibling classes suggested that mean family size of the homosexual study groups was comparatively smaller to that of the heterosexual groups in both studies.

  heterozygous for a simple Mendelian autosomal gene alpha have a child, the probability 
  that the child will show the dominant phenotype is 3/4. Let's ask
  a somewhat more complex question. If this couple has a total of four children, 
  what is the probability that 3 of the 4 will show the dominant phenotype? To 
  answer this, we will first derive the appropriate formula and then use it to 
  calculate the numerical answer. The same formula allows us to understand the 
  expected statistical distribution of the various possible phenotype patterns 
  in four-child ( or any other size) families in a large population.    1. Review: How can some simple overall probabilities be calculated 
  by combining the multiplication and addition "rules" we covered earlier?  Let's start with a very simple case: asking about gender probabilities in families 
  of three children.  What is the probability that all three children in a family will be the same 
  gender? P(all female)= 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all male ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all one gender) = P(all female) + P(all male) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4  What is the probability that a three-child family is two girls and one boy? Each possible birth order has P=1/8. That is, P(G,G,B)=P(G,B,G)=P(B,G,G)=1/8. So, P(2G,1B)= 3/8 and P(1G,2B)= 3/8.  This allows us to write the overall gender probability distribution for families 
  of three children as follows: 1/8 will be three girls 3/8 will be two girls and one boy 3/8 will be one girl and two boys 1/8 will be three boys Adding it all up, we have 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1 (100%)     2. How can we understand and use "Pascal's triangle" 
  and the "general rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities", 
  formula 1 (page 161 in textbook)?  Consider the numerators of the fractions in the above three-child family gender 
  equation: 1 , 3 , 3 , 1. These numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of the term 
  (p + q) cubed. In general, the coefficients of any such binomial expansion { the 
  term (p+q) raised to any power} give the "number of ways" that something 
  can happen.  Figure 4.21, "Pascal's triangle", shows these coefficients for the expansion 
  of (p + q) raised to any power up to 10. The numbers in any row can be used 
  just as described above. For example, assume that over the next two decades 
  you have 6 kids. There are 64 possible gender birth orders, with 20 of these 
  resulting in you having three girls and three boys.  The terms p and q are the individual probabilities for a specific outcome from 
  a single "event". For "gender" calculations, the probabilities p and 
  q are equal, both = 1/2 (the equal probabilities of male and female births).  For "dominant : recessive phenotype" type of calculations, p and q will usually 
  not be equal. For a simple Mendelian inheritance from two heterozygotic parents, 
  p will = 3/4 (if AA and Aa give dominant phenotype) and q will 
  = 1/4 ( aa gives recessive phenotype).  Generalizing this, we get to the formula on page 161 in your text that is "the general 
  rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities". The term (n!/s!t!) 
  is the number of possible ways (orders) of getting a certain net outcome ( "a 
  total of n ; with s of one and t of the other"). This 
  number can either be calculated or taken directly from Pascal's triangle.    3. Sample problem: You and your mate are both heterozygous 
  for some simple Mendelian gene alpha (i.e., each of you has genotype Aa , and both of you show the dominant phenotype) on chromosome #1. Over 
  the next decade, you proceed to have four children. What is the probability 
  that 3 of your children will show the dominant phenotype and one will show the 
  recessive phenotype? What are the probabilities of the other possible outcomes?  If we were looking at thousands of such families, we know that the overall ratio 
  of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the children would average out to 3:1, 
  as shown by a simple Punnett square. But for one couple having four children, 
  what's the probability, P(3D,1r)?  To calculate P(3D,1r), we use formula 1 for the case n=4, s=3, t=1, p=3/4, 
  q=1/4. P(3D,1r)= 4!/3! x (3/4)cubed x (1/4) = 4 x (27/64) x 1/4 = .42 ( 42% )  By also calculating the other four possibilities, we can construct a graph that shows the statistical distribution you would expect 
  to see in a large population.      Problem S-4: "Heterozygous parents; have three children".  Modify the sample problem above to do the calculations for you and your mate (both Aa ) having THREE children. Do the calculations for the probabilities that all three, two, one, or none of the three children will show the dominant phenotype from gene alpha . Construct the graph and compare the result with the "four children" graph done in class.  5��-W�M�� *�+�P+��������&i���̄�/��M�f�XA�tǰ.� 8/s���:

More Than You Think  There may never be a time when people will accurately answer surveys, but at least survey givers are getting better at tricking us into being honest  (Kellie Parker)    By Rose Eveleth    smithsonian.com   October 24, 2013         What percentage of the population considers themselves gay? This number has always been hard to pin down: sexuality is fluid, and plenty of people still feel pressured to hide their sexual orientation. But a new study has tried, and come up with a number that’s higher than most.    According to a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research , about 20 percent of the population is attracted to their own gender. That’s nearly double the usual estimates of about 10 percent. The authors explain that their methodology might have something to do with it:   Participants were randomly assigned to either a “best practices method” that was computer-based and provides privacy and anonymity, or to a “veiled elicitation method” that further conceals individual responses. Answers in the veiled method preclude inference about any particular individual, but can be used to accurately estimate statistics about the population. Comparing the two methods shows sexuality-related questions receive biased responses even under current best practices, and, for many questions, the bias is substantial. The veiled method increased self-reports of non-heterosexual identity by 65% (p<0.05) and same-sex sexual experiences by 59% (p<0.01). The veiled method also increased the rates of anti-gay sentiment. Respondents were 67% more likely to express disapproval of an openly gay manager at work (p<0.01) and 71% more likely to say it is okay to discriminate against lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals (p<0.01).   Essentially, using a veiled question rather than a direct one uncovered a whole group of people who would not directly say they weren’t heterosexual. This kind of veiled questioning can get at all sorts of answers that people don’t want to give, like the incidence of rape . Daniel Luzer at Pacific Standard explains that uncovering these hidden biases is really important for understanding how accurate these kinds of surveys actually are:   The most important takeaway isn’t a final tally of the gay people in society, but, rather, an understanding of the ways in which surveys and other existing attempts to measure such things might be slightly misleading. “The results show non-heterosexuality and anti-gay sentiment are substantially underestimated in existing surveys, and the privacy afforded by current best practices is not always sufficient to eliminate bias,” note the researchers, who were just looking at the way surveys might under-count both homosexuality and attitudes toward homosexuality.   There may never be a time when people will accurately answer surveys, but at least survey givers are getting better at tricking us into being honest.

Since the quotient $G/Z(G)$ cannot be nontrivial cyclic, these two cases cover all bases. Let $Z=Z(G)$.  $\rm\color{Blue}{(i)}$: Write $G=Z\sqcup aZ\sqcup bZ\sqcup cZ$. Check $C_G(g)=Z\cup aZ$ for $g\in aZ$, and similarly for the other two cosets $bZ$ and $cZ$, while of course $C_G(g)=G$ if $g\in Z$. Use $[\Omega]$ for the Iverson bracket (i.e. $[\Omega]=1$ if $\Omega$ is true, and $[\Omega]=0$ otherwise). Calculate  $$P=\frac{1}{|G\times G|}\sum_{a\in G}\sum_{b\in G}[ab=ba]=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{a\in G}|C_G(a)|=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\sum_{a\in Z}|G|+\sum_{a\in G\setminus Z}\frac{|G|}{2}\right)$$  $$=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(|Z||G|+|G\setminus Z|\frac{|G|}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\frac{|G|}{4}|G|+\frac{3|G|}{4}\frac{|G|}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{8}.$$  $\rm\color{Blue}{(ii)}$: Start the same way as above, writing  $$P=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{a\in G}|C_G(a)|=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\sum_{a\in Z}|G|+\sum_{a\in G\setminus Z}|C_G(a)|\right).$$  Using $|Z|\le|G|/6$ and $|C_G(a)|\le|G|/2$, we obtain the upper bound  $$P\le\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(|G||Z|+\big(|G|-|Z|\big)\frac{|G|}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\left(\frac{|G|^2}{2}+|Z|\frac{|G|}{2}\right)\le\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{7}{12}.$$  Note $7/12<5/8$. Therefore, we have proven:  Theorem . $P>\frac{5}{8}$ iff $G$ is abelian, $P=\frac{5}{8}$ iff $G/Z(G)$ is Klein-$4$, and $P\le\frac{7}{12}$ otherwise.  There are a couple slick character-theoretic proofs on mathoverflow, as well as forcing probabilities for solvability, nilpotence and odd cardinality. Note the $5/8$ bound is true for compact topological groups , where we pick $(a,b)\in G\times G$ according to the normalized Haar measure. One formula for the commuting probability $P$ that I didn't discuss above is as follows:  $$P=\frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{a\in G}|C_G(a)|=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{a\in G}\frac{1}{[G:C_G(a)]}=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{a\in C_i}\frac{1}{|C_i|}=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{|C_i|}{|C_i|}=\frac{k}{|G|},$$  where $C_1,\cdots,C_k$ are the conjugacy classes of $G$ and $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:58       Community ♦   1        answered Jun 24 '14 at 19:54       blue   12.9k 22 41              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

The findings, reported this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, by Anthony Bogaert of Brock University, lend credence to the theory that it's not the social or rearing factors that influence a man's sexual orientation, but rather prenatal mechanisms that begin in the womb. The idea that prenatal mechanisms may influence sexual orientation has been around for a couple of decades. In 1996, Bogaert along with colleague Ray Blanchard correlated sexual orientation in men with the number of older brothers, but it wasn't clear if that influence was occurring because the boys shared the same household or because they had shared the same womb. In the new study, Bogaert pitted prenatal against postnatal by examining four samples of homosexual and heterosexual men, for a total of 944 participants. The data for three of the samples had been collected previously, and included detailed information about the men's sexual orientation, as well as their family life. Because most of the men from these three study groups came from unbroken families, Bogaert looked at a fourth group, composed of men who had been adopted or raised with half- or step-siblings. He also gathered data from this group about how long members lived with each sibling and whether they had brothers or sisters with whom they had never lived. He reasoned that if the social or rearing factor theories were correct, he would expect to see certain things. First, it wouldn't matter whether a gay man's older brothers had been biologically related or not, the social influence would be there. Second, the amount of time the young boy lived with his older brothers, biological or not, should affect his sexual orientation. Third, if the boy did not live with older brothers, then the numbers should not impact his sexual preference. Bogaert found the opposite to be true. First, he found that only the number of biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men--even when the number of non-biological older brothers was significantly higher. Second, his study showed that the amount of time reared with older brothers--either related or not--did not predict a young boy's becoming homosexual. And surprisingly, Bogaert discovered that even if a young man did not grow up in the same house as his older brothers, the fact that he had older biological brothers increased his odds of being gay. The fact that the common denominator between the older and younger biological brothers is the mother hints at a prenatal influence on sexual orientation. What it could be is still a mystery. But one theory suggests that after delivering a boy, a woman's immune system produces antibodies to male-specific proteins. During subsequent pregnancies the mother's placenta may deliver the antibodies to the fetus, possibly affecting its development.
