Many couples who are facing this issue will seek professional treatment in order to achieve a pregnancy. One of the most common methods of treating infertility is through a drug that is known as Clomid. Clomid, or clomiphine citrate, is used to stimulate eggs so that more are developed and then released by the ovaries. It is taken by mouth once per day for the 5 days prior to an ovulation period.  Statistics on Clomid Multiples  1. Women who take Clomid have successful single birth pregnancies 92% of the time.  2. For women who conceive while taking Clomid, the chances of having twins is 5-10%.  3. The chances for a woman to have triplets while on Clomid is 0.5%.  4. The percentage of women who conceive twins without the use of fertility treatments: 1.2%.  5. Clomid is not responsible for multiple births when men are taking it.  6. Clomid will cause a pregnancy in most couples who are attempting to conceive within 6 months. A majority of women will conceive within the first 90 days.  7. Some women will still have Clomid in their system 6 weeks after stopping it.  8. Of the reported pregnancies in Clomid studies, the incidence of multiple pregnancies was 7.98%.  9. The ratio of monozygotic to dizygotic twins was about 1:5.  10. The survival rate of multiple births that occur from Clomid is 83.25%, compared to the 73% survival rate of infants born without fertility treatments.  11. Specific fetal abnormalities were all reported to be under 1%.  12. Every monthly attempt to conceive with Clomid results in a 15-20% pregnancy rate per attempt.  13. 80% of women taking clomiphene citrate will successfully ovulate, but fewer than 50% of patients will conceive.  14. One study showed that 87% of the women who ovulated but failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate had an additional cause of infertility such as pelvic lesions, tubal disease, endometriosis, male factor infertility, or a combination of these issues.  15. The success rates are less than 15% per cycle even when combined with IUI for patients that have unexplained infertility issues.  16. The average cost for Clomid for a cycle is about $40.  17. The average cost for generic clomiphene citrate is about $15.  18. Pregnancies are very rarely higher than triplets, but have been known to occur. There is one clinically documented pregnancy of sextuplets that has occurred with Clomid.  19. Hot flashes are sometimes experienced as a side effect of Clomid. These are similar to the hot flashes that menopausal women experience.  20. 72% of the women who take Clomid wind up visiting their OBGYN for birthing assistance because of the treatments.  21. The vast majority (80%) of women who are prescribed Clomid have menstrual irregularity due to polycystic ovary syndrome.  22. For women above the age of 35, the success rate of Clomid drops to about 6%-8% per cycle as a direct result of aging.  23. 2% of women who take Clomid report having visual side effects.   Risks and Additional Information  Because the ovaries are stimulated by this drug, there is a possibility of having twins or triplets because of the amount of eggs that are released. It also increases the overall chances of a couple achieving a pregnancy. It may be a popular drug, but the side effects of it can sometimes be serious. Most mild side effects, such as throwing up or feeling warm, can be treated at home. Weight gain, cysts, or changes in vision should be treated by a doctor immediately.  There are also some risks associated with Clomid that are not always commonly known before treatment begins. For women who take this drug in prolonged doses, there is an increased risk of burying cancer developing. Multiple pregnant are the other, more obvious risk. Mothers that have a pregnancy of multiples face unique challenges that singleton pregnancies do not always face.  With the success rates of this drug, however, most couples who are struggling to achieve a pregnancy are willing to take on these risks. As you can see in the statistics, not only are the chances of having a single birth very likely when Clomid is taken, but the chances of having multiple births increases as well.      Important Facts About Clomid  There are known causes of infertility, Clomid can be very successful in treating it. If infertility is being caused by unknown factors, this drug is not as successful.  What makes Clomid such a useful fertility treatment is that it works in both men and women. Not only can it stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, but it can support the development of sperm cells within men as well. This means that any infertility issue that a couple faces may be solved thanks to this very affordable wonder drug. Although success is not guaranteed, major studies have shown that only 8% of women who are exposed to this drug are unable to achieve a pregnancy.  Having multiples does regularly happen when taking Clomid, but the odds are still that a single birth is going to happen. Only about one in 10 mothers will have a multiples birth. And when that happens, twins are the most likely outcome. Fewer than one in 100 Clomid pregnancies results in the creation of triplets.  What is interesting about Clomid is that certain women seem to be resistant to the drug. The regular dose is 50 mg every day, but some women do not even respond when 150 mg is used as a treatment option. Women who are resistant to Clomid will typically not have a successful fertility treatment with this drug need to look at other options.  With no enhancement of miscarriage rates and potentially better long-term survival rates for infants were born, many couples have found Clomid to be a successful treatment option. That is why this drug is so popular today.

Clomid is a super popular and commonly prescribed fertility drug all over the world.    All about Clomid  If you are just beginning on your fertility journey, chances are that you have already heard of Clomid. Clomid is a super popular and commonly prescribed fertility drug all over the world. When a woman seeks fertility help, Clomid is often a doctor’s first choice for treatment, and helps to jump start ovulation in many women. Clomid helps to stimulate the ovaries and help to make sure that a woman is ovulating. When a woman is taking Clomid, her body is producing more follicles and hormones than usual, and estrogen levels are also increased. Sometimes, while on Clomid, a woman can produce more than one mature egg. If these eggs are fertilized, then a woman will have twins. Clomid does increase chances of having twins , but not as much as you might think. Keep reading for more information on Clomid twins and just how common they are. Claim Your 20 Free Pregnancy Tests – Click Here   Likelihood of Clomid twins  The chance of getting pregnant with twins naturally, without any fertility drugs, is not very high at all, only between 1 and 3 percent. Many people think that by taking Clomid, women increase their chance of having twins very dramatically, but that is not actually the case. We do hear about Clomid twins quite often on blogs or online message boards, but the chances of having Clomid twins really is not that great. The chance of having twins while taking Clomid is only around 8-10 percent, so it does increase a woman’s chances, but not that much. When it comes to multiples, the chance of conceiving them while taking Clomid is even more rare. Only one percent of Clomid pregnancies result in triplets or higher order multiples.   More info on Clomid twins  While some women might plan to use Clomid to get pregnant with twins on purpose, that is definitely not advisable. Twins can cause pregnancy complications, and put both mother and baby at a higher risk. Women younger than 25 are much more likely to have twins while taking Clomid. Obviously, if a woman who doesn’t have any problems ovulating, she doesn’t need Clomid. Taking Clomid when you don’t need to makes twins much more likely, as does taking more than the recommended dosage. Always follow your doctor’s orders when it comes to Clomid and never take it without close supervision by a doctor. Even if you really want to have twins, taking Clomid without following doctor’s orders can be very dangerous. As with all sorts of drugs, only take Clomid as directed and stay in close contact with your doctor to make sure that you get the best results.

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments.

It is the most commonly used fertility drug . Because Clomid can be prescribed by a gynecologist and doesn't require a fertility specialist, it's also the very first fertility treatment tried for most couples. Clomid is taken as a pill. This is unlike the stronger fertility drugs, which require injection. Clomid is also very effective, stimulating ovulation 80 percent of the time.         Clomid may also be marketed under the name Serophene, or you may see it sold under its generic name, clomiphene citrate. Note: Clomid can also be used as a treatment for male infertility. This article focuses on Clomid treatment in women. When Is Clomid Used? If a woman has irregular cycles , or anovulatory cycles (menstruation without ovulation), Clomid may be tried first. Clomid is often used in treating polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) related infertility It may also be used in cases of unexplained infertility or when a couple prefers not to use the more expensive and invasive fertility treatments. (However, it's important to remember that the more expensive treatment is sometimes the most appropriate.) Clomid may also be used during an IUI (intrauterine insemination) procedure. It is rarely used during IVF treatment. With IVF, injectable ovulation medications are more frequently chosen. When Is Clomid Not the Best Choice? Clomid may not be for you if...   You have blocked fallopian tubes , fibroids, or other uterine abnormalities. You have an ovarian cyst. (This is not the same as having the tiny cysts that accompany polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) .) You’re dealing with male infertility . (Unless we’re talking about Clomid for men. ) You have low ovarian reserves , either due to age or primary ovarian insufficiency (formerly known as premature ovarian failure).         Your ovulation problems would be better solved by other treatments. (For example, in a woman with hyperprolactinemia , treating the hyperprolactinemia would be the preferred first step.) You have a hormone-reactive tumor, which may grow with Clomid use, or you have a history of certain cancers. You’ve reacted poorly to Clomid treatment in the past. Can Clomid Help You Get Pregnant Faster if You Have No Fertility Problems? If you have problems with ovulation , Clomid may help you ovulate. But what if you don’t have ovulation problems? A study of over 1,000 women looked at whether Clomid could help women who were having trouble getting pregnant but were not having ovulation problems. When comparing women who took Clomid with women who received either a placebo or no treatment, researchers found that there was no improvement in pregnancy rates, even when Clomid was coupled with IUI treatment . (IUI is insemination.) It’s not unheard of for a woman to lie to her doctor to get Clomid, thinking it will help her conceive faster. Not only will it likely not help her get pregnant faster, but now she’s at risk for experiencing side effects. (Some of those side effects reduce your fertility. More on this below.)         How Is Clomid Taken? You should follow the directions your doctor gives you. Every doctor has a slightly different protocol. With that said, the most common dosage of Clomid is 50 mg taken for five days, on Days 3 through 7 of your cycle. Some doctors prefer you take the pills on Days 5 through 9 of your cycle. Does it matter if your doctor suggests the Day 3 to 7 protocol or the Day 5 to 9 one? Not really. Ovulation and pregnancy rates have been shown to be similar whether the drug is started on day two, three, four, or five. Clomid Day by Day: What to Expect, What's Happening in Your Body Don't feel concerned if your doctor tells you a different protocol to follow than your friend.  If 50 mg doesn't work, your doctor may increase the medication. Or, they may give it another try at 50 mg. You might think that more is always better, but higher doses, especially at or above 150 mg, can make conception more difficult. (See below, under side effects.) When Should You Have Sex When Taking Clomid? To get pregnant when taking Clomid , you need to have sexual intercourse when you are most fertile. This will be the few days just before ovulation. This varies slightly from person to person, but most women ovulate 7 to 10 days after the last Clomid pill was taken. This means you are most likely to ovulate somewhere between Day 14 and 19 of your cycle. To have sex during your most fertile time (which is the two to three days before you ovulate), you may want to consider having sex every other day start on Day 11 and ending on Day 21. Or, another option is to use an ovulation predictor test to detect your most fertile time. Whenever the test indicates you're fertile, have sex that day and the next few days. If you're also having a trigger shot (injection of hCG) during your Clomid cycle, your doctor will instruct you to have sexual intercourse on the day of the injection and the two following days. For example, if you have the injection on Monday, you should have sex on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. What are Clomid's Common Side Effects? Clomid's side effects aren't so bad, as far as fertility drugs are concerned. The most common side effects are hot flashes, breast tenderness, mood swings, and nausea. Once the medication is stopped, the side effects will leave, too. Possible side effects of Clomid include: Enlarged and tender ovaries (14 percent) Hot flashes (11 percent) Abdominal tenderness, due to enlarged and tender ovaries (7.4 percent) Bloating (5.5 percent) Breast tenderness (2.1 percent) Vaginal dryness or thicker cervical mucus (percentage of occurrence not available) Nausea and vomiting (2.2 percent) Anxiety and insomnia (1.9 percent) Vision disturbances (1.6 percent) Headache (1.3 percent) Abnormal uterine bleeding (spotting) (0.5 percent) Mood swings and fatigue (0.3 percent) One of the more ironic side effects to comprehend is that Clomid can decrease the quality of your cervical mucus . This can cause problems with sperm being able to move easily through the cervix, making conception more difficult. Clomid can also make the lining of your uterus thinner and less ideal for implantation. This is why "more" is not necessarily better when it comes to Clomid dosage and use. What Are the Chances That You'll Conceive Twins? The side effect you're probably most familiar with is the risk of multiples. It's not nearly as common as you may think it is. You have a 10 percent chance of having twins when taking Clomid. This means that 1 in 10 pregnancies conceived with Clomid lead to twins. This doesn’t mean you should brush off the risk of having a multiple birth. Only that you shouldn’t assume Clomid will get you twins. Triplets or quadruplets on Clomid are rare, happening less than 1 percent of the time. Are the Mood Swings of Clomid Real? Clomid does mess with your hormones, and your hormones do have an effect on your emotional well-being . Research on mood swings while taking Clomid indicate a much higher rate than the initial clinical trials of the drug. The clinical trials reported that only 0.3 percent of women experienced mood swings or fatigue. That breaks down to 3 in 1,000 patients. However, later research found that between 40 and 45 percent of women experienced mood swings. That's almost one in every two women. The "Clomid Crazies" are a bit like PMS mood swings—but slightly worse. However, if you experience severe mood swings on Clomid, be sure to contact your doctor. How Successful Is Clomid? Clomid will jump-start ovulation in 80 percent of patients, but ovulating doesn't guarantee pregnancy will occur. About 40 to 45 percent of women using Clomid will get pregnant within six cycles of use. While Clomid does help many women ovulate, obviously it's not always successful. When Clomid does not result in ovulation , we say the woman is Clomid resistant . (This isn't the same as when Clomid does trigger ovulation but doesn't lead to pregnancy.) What happens when Clomid doesn’t work? You won’t necessarily need to move up to more complicated treatments right away. Your doctor may prescribe the diabetes drug metformin to take alongside Clomid. Or, they may move you onto a drug called letrozole. Letrozole —which is a cancer treatment drug used off-label for infertility—has been found to help women ovulate who are Clomid resistant. For How Many Cycles Can You Take Clomid? Clomid should not be used indefinitely. One reason for that is the possible increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Several studies have looked into whether fertility drugs increase your odds for cancer. The good news is that most studies link infertility itself, and not Clomid use, to the higher risk of cancer. This means if Clomid helps you get pregnant, just getting pregnant and having a baby will decrease your cancer risk. The bad news is that some studies have found that cancer risk goes up if you’re treated with Clomid over an extended time, even when compared to other infertile women who don’t conceive. Even though research seems to indicate that infertility itself is the cause for increased cancer odds, just to be safe, most doctors recommend limiting treatment to 12 months. Some prefer to be extra cautious and limit treatment to six months. Can You Buy Clomid Online Without a Prescription? There are reputable pharmacy websites where you can fill a prescription for Clomid, but you should never try taking Clomid without a doctor's supervision. First of all, the only way to purchase Clomid without a prescription is via illegal and shady websites. You have no idea who is selling you the drugs and no way to know if you're getting Clomid or something else. Secondly, even though Clomid treatment is relatively simple, it is not for everyone, and it can be harmful. You should never buy Clomid online without a prescription.

I am 30 yrs old and always had slightly irregular periods. The cycles could range from 30 days to 45 days… After a couple of months of trying to conceive with my husband, my period suddenly stopped altogether for a couple of months for no reason. I tested negative on pregnancy tests. So I got 50mg of Clomid that i took for one course on cd3-7 and i immediately became pregnant with twins! My insurance didn’t cover Clomid. So I got it online to save money. My sister gave me the code “CLO4MULT” and she said ‘just Google it’.                 JaneRenfrow    Answered 6/16/17               31 found this helpful     For women who don't ovulate on their own the chances of concieving twins on Clomid is reported to be about 1/20 and signifigantly less for triplets or higher order multiples. BUT.... For a woman who ovulates regularly, (on her own without medication,) the chances of concieving multiples on Clomid signifigantly increases. Clomid basically tricks your body into producing more Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) which does pretty much what it sounds like... Stimulates follicles in the ovaries to produce mutiple mature eggs to be realeased at ovulation. If more than one egg is released, fertilized by a man's sperm, and they all implant in the uturine lining then you end up pregnant with multiples.                 katie13440    Answered 12/13/11               31 found this helpful     I have just found out that I am having triplets from clomid after 11 years of ttc. So ladies there is always hope and miricles happen everyday. I only had two eggs and I am having three babies.

Trying to concieve and i dont ovulate normally so i was put on 100mg of clomid since 50mg didnt work. I was wondering what my chances are of having twins on 100mg of clomid and if there is any women out there who have had twins on that dose?

I didnt have any problems getting pregnant with our first child. So I took clomid 50mg for 5 days and I ovulated and found out 3 weeks latter I am having a baby and recently at 8 weeks along I found out I am having twins. My insurance didnt cover Clomid.

I would olny be 5 weeks tomorrow. Dr was so surprised that the 2 pink lines showed up with in seconds and very dark. Get ultrasound at 7 weeks. I have a feeling there is more than one baby.

Many couples who are facing this issue will seek professional treatment in order to achieve a pregnancy. One of the most common methods of treating infertility is through a drug that is known as Clomid. Clomid, or clomiphine citrate, is used to stimulate eggs so that more are developed and then released by the ovaries. It is taken by mouth once per day for the 5 days prior to an ovulation period.  Statistics on Clomid Multiples  1. Women who take Clomid have successful single birth pregnancies 92% of the time.  2. For women who conceive while taking Clomid, the chances of having twins is 5-10%.  3. The chances for a woman to have triplets while on Clomid is 0.5%.  4. The percentage of women who conceive twins without the use of fertility treatments: 1.2%.  5. Clomid is not responsible for multiple births when men are taking it.  6. Clomid will cause a pregnancy in most couples who are attempting to conceive within 6 months. A majority of women will conceive within the first 90 days.  7. Some women will still have Clomid in their system 6 weeks after stopping it.  8. Of the reported pregnancies in Clomid studies, the incidence of multiple pregnancies was 7.98%.  9. The ratio of monozygotic to dizygotic twins was about 1:5.  10. The survival rate of multiple births that occur from Clomid is 83.25%, compared to the 73% survival rate of infants born without fertility treatments.  11. Specific fetal abnormalities were all reported to be under 1%.  12. Every monthly attempt to conceive with Clomid results in a 15-20% pregnancy rate per attempt.  13. 80% of women taking clomiphene citrate will successfully ovulate, but fewer than 50% of patients will conceive.  14. One study showed that 87% of the women who ovulated but failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate had an additional cause of infertility such as pelvic lesions, tubal disease, endometriosis, male factor infertility, or a combination of these issues.  15. The success rates are less than 15% per cycle even when combined with IUI for patients that have unexplained infertility issues.  16. The average cost for Clomid for a cycle is about $40.  17. The average cost for generic clomiphene citrate is about $15.  18. Pregnancies are very rarely higher than triplets, but have been known to occur. There is one clinically documented pregnancy of sextuplets that has occurred with Clomid.  19. Hot flashes are sometimes experienced as a side effect of Clomid. These are similar to the hot flashes that menopausal women experience.  20. 72% of the women who take Clomid wind up visiting their OBGYN for birthing assistance because of the treatments.  21. The vast majority (80%) of women who are prescribed Clomid have menstrual irregularity due to polycystic ovary syndrome.  22. For women above the age of 35, the success rate of Clomid drops to about 6%-8% per cycle as a direct result of aging.  23. 2% of women who take Clomid report having visual side effects.   Risks and Additional Information  Because the ovaries are stimulated by this drug, there is a possibility of having twins or triplets because of the amount of eggs that are released. It also increases the overall chances of a couple achieving a pregnancy. It may be a popular drug, but the side effects of it can sometimes be serious. Most mild side effects, such as throwing up or feeling warm, can be treated at home. Weight gain, cysts, or changes in vision should be treated by a doctor immediately.  There are also some risks associated with Clomid that are not always commonly known before treatment begins. For women who take this drug in prolonged doses, there is an increased risk of burying cancer developing. Multiple pregnant are the other, more obvious risk. Mothers that have a pregnancy of multiples face unique challenges that singleton pregnancies do not always face.  With the success rates of this drug, however, most couples who are struggling to achieve a pregnancy are willing to take on these risks. As you can see in the statistics, not only are the chances of having a single birth very likely when Clomid is taken, but the chances of having multiple births increases as well.      Important Facts About Clomid  There are known causes of infertility, Clomid can be very successful in treating it. If infertility is being caused by unknown factors, this drug is not as successful.  What makes Clomid such a useful fertility treatment is that it works in both men and women. Not only can it stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, but it can support the development of sperm cells within men as well. This means that any infertility issue that a couple faces may be solved thanks to this very affordable wonder drug. Although success is not guaranteed, major studies have shown that only 8% of women who are exposed to this drug are unable to achieve a pregnancy.  Having multiples does regularly happen when taking Clomid, but the odds are still that a single birth is going to happen. Only about one in 10 mothers will have a multiples birth. And when that happens, twins are the most likely outcome. Fewer than one in 100 Clomid pregnancies results in the creation of triplets.  What is interesting about Clomid is that certain women seem to be resistant to the drug. The regular dose is 50 mg every day, but some women do not even respond when 150 mg is used as a treatment option. Women who are resistant to Clomid will typically not have a successful fertility treatment with this drug need to look at other options.  With no enhancement of miscarriage rates and potentially better long-term survival rates for infants were born, many couples have found Clomid to be a successful treatment option. That is why this drug is so popular today.

This is my first month on clomid, and I have an HSG tomorrow and will be using a trigger shot. I've been thinking a lot about the possibility of multiples with this much intervention. Dr said multiple rate on clomid is about 10%, but if love to hear any stories you ladies have! Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  42 Posts s  sablal2 We did! Found out we were having twins at 7 weeks pregnant. First cycle of chlomid with ovidrel injection. Reply  Close b  babylulu611 You should ask this on the infertility board, you will get a more realistic response as everyone here has twins. For all the people who have twins conceived with clomid there are many many more who only conceived one. I said to another poster if you walked into a room of lung cancer patients and said "I have a cough, could it be cancer?" A lot of them would say "maybe, I had a cough", whereas if you ask the general population most people will tell you they just have a cold. Reply  Close l  labrady @babylulu611  I guess what I'm interested in is not how many people on clomid have twins. But out of all of you mommies that have multiples, how many were taking clomid. If that makes sense! :) Reply  Close l  labrady @sablal2  I'm doing clomid and ovadril too. It's funny, one of my best friends had fraternal twins naturally and 5 years later had a single with clomid, ovadril and IUI. Guess you never know!! Reply  Close b  babyb-z @labrady  Twins here on the second round of 50mg clomid + trigger shot. We were so shocked! Our doc had said up to 15% chance of twins, but we still assumed we'd only have one. Reply  Close m  moonlight00 I did! Though the first round of IUI, there was only a singleton who failed to develop and I had a D&C around 8 weeks. The second time around, the doc spotted 2 sacs but only one bean. It took us 2 more ultrasounds to spot the second twin. Reply  Close A  Allie622 I did conceive twins on clomid, currently almost 18 weeks. I was on my 5th round of 100mg clomid, no shots. Reply  Close F  FTMKay I think the rate of twinning naturally is 3% vs 8% with Clomid (based on what our fertility doctor told us) so Clomid does raise your chances but not by much. Looking at it from a difference perspective, the "risk" of having a singleton naturally is 97% vs 92% with Clomid. So very, very likely it'll only be one either way :-) Reply  Close l  lgthompson Me. 4th round of clomid, 50mg. But I have lots and lots of friends who had singletons on clomid. Chances normally are 3%, clomid brings it up to 7-8%. So not drastically higher. Reply  Close e  ecmewton My first was from Clomid, trigger shot, and IUI. 3 follicles were large enough to ovulate, and resulted in just one single baby. Fast forward 5 years, we are spontaneously pregnant with identical twins. Ha! Reply  Close K  Kellib83 In less than a few hours My husband and I head to the hospital at 38 weeks prego to deliver my twin girls! I never imagined twins but last June I had a misscarriage and in October my doc gave me 4 days of some estrogen suppressant to get my cycle regular again and holy cow I'm now having twins! I had no idea the drug could influence my fertility or rate of having twins but I read it increases the chances up to 3 or so %... After the fact! We r still in so much shock! And I obviously can't sleep tonight lol good luck everyone! Reply  Close h  hbroski 5th round of clomid (no shots) with only one fallopian tube due to an ectopic pregnancy in my left tube that ruptured & could not be repaired so it had to be completely removed 7 months prior to conceiving my b/g twins. Found out there were 2 buns in the oven around 8 weeks. Reply  Close S  Shwhite @labrady  I'm totally not trying to be rude, but you already know the rate. It really is: 8-10% of pregnancies resulting from the use of clomid will result in multiple births. I'm only pointing this out because I want to answer whatever underlying questions you may have about the process or general experience. If you really do just want to know that people here did end up with multiples on clomid, I did. It was after one round of clomid and a trigger injection with IUI. Reply  Close l  labrady @Shwhite  No ulterior motive, was just curious to hear people's stories. Did they take clomid, did they use a trigger, etc. I'd had it in my mind that multiples wouldn't be something we would have to think about unless we had to get all the way to IVF. I was shocked when my dr mentioned it several times in our clomid conversation! (This is our first month using a fertility specialist) Thank you all for taking the time to respond, I really do appreciate it! It was fun to read all of your stories, and congrats on your babies! Reply  Close P  PWoodworth I actually did 5 rounds IUI with estrogen, trigger shot, clomid and then progesterone. Ironically, none of those cycles worked for me. My doctor switched me to letrozole instead because the clomid over time thinned out my endometrial lining too much. First cycle replacing clomid with letrozole and here I am 33w with twins :) I wanted to share this because too many women hear about clomid and think that if it doesn't work, they have to go to IVF when there are other options out there. The 6 total IUIs I had were with two different doctors (took 5 years for my miracle to happen) so hang in there! Reply  Close s  sammipacheco11 I didn't get pregnant at all with Clomid. We ended up doing IVF and now are expecting twins. Reply  Close g  greeneggsam I did Clomid "plain" (3x), Clomid + IUI (2x), but did not conceive.  We used IVF (2x) to conceive our identical girls. I think doctors over-prescribe Clomid.  My husband and I had been timing everything right for a year, and the first two docs I saw both gave me Clomid.  In short, if you believe you have an ovulation issue, Clomid can help.  But, if you feel, like I did, that ovulation was not the issue, you're wasting your time.  Tell your doctor you want to go on to something else.  I wasted 6 months trying stuff that I just knew wouldn't work... Reply  Close l  labrady @greeneggsam  Great info! Ovulation is totally my issue- I ovulate, but my eggs are poor quality. I usually ovulate day 16-18 and only have 26 day cycles. My progesterone has never been above 7, so my body doesn't create the healthy uterine lining for an embryo to attach to. Dr prescribed clomid to improve egg quality and trigger shot to force me to ovulate earlier. We're hopeful that clomid with do the trick quickly. I go Monday to check my follicles! After months of ttc and a miscarriage, everything makes so much sense after meeting with an RE specialist! Reply  Close b  babymama0927 We conceived twins with Famara, FSH shots, trigger shot and an IUI :) clomid never worked for us. Good luck!!

Reply  Close h  hogan814 We did several cycles of clomid that were unsuccessful, but from what I remember, the odds of multiples averaged about 10%, but were more likely with increased doses.

Reply  Close 0  06emjozwiak I researched the chances of conceiving multiples when I was on clomid. Like you I was willing to accept the risk of twins but I hoped to avoid it. It seemed like most sources agreed the chances of conceiving twins on clomid is 9% (general population has a 3% chance) and the chance of conceiving triplets is .1%. I never conceived on clomid because it never made me ovulate. I conceived with letrozole, metformin, provera, prometrium, ovidrel, and IUI (I have unexplained hormonal infertility and anovulation). The chances of twins were even smaller with letrozole than clomid, but I was aware that I had two follicles when I triggered. And I did have twins! Good luck!

Reply  Close m  mland4905 I have not used clomid but my mom did and she had twins (me and my brother) she said she was on a very small dose, and this was in the 1980s.

I was just curious how many of you got PG with multiples while being treated with clomid and then having an IUI....i am going in for my first IUI tomorrow and my brain is just thinking a lot!  Twins run in my family but the Dr's told me that doesn't "up" my odds of having them though an IUI. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  16 Posts m  myownlittlebean @Hoping4aBabyin2012  I took one round of low dose clomid and ended up with twins - no IUI.  The running in the family part only applies to fraternal twins on your mother's side... we have multiple sets of identical twins (mom's side) as well as a couple sets of fraternal (dad's side), but that didn't increase our odds.  The clomid just made me release more than one egg and they both were fertilized and here I am at almost 30 weeks pregnant excited to meet my little boy and girl :). Good luck! Obviously, you've had some difficulty getting pregnant, so I hope for your sake that you do get at least 2 for 1 :). I know we feel extra blessed and were thrilled to find out it was twins. I  IASoupMama @Hoping4aBabyin2012  Me!  That's why I have twin girls. Our fertility issues weren't me, though, so I was sort of anticipating that, since I was already ovulating, the Clomid would make me drop more than one egg.  I was right, LOL!  We were doing the IUI because DH's spermies were sleepies.  I'm pretty glad, actually, that the successful IUI only fertilized two eggs, because I don't know how many were available that month :) H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @myownlittlebean  Thank you so much!  I would love twins.  I have twin nephews and they are so much fun.  My fingers are crossed.  Congrats and Good luck to you!   What a blessing. H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @IASoupMama  Our fertility issues are also with DH and not myself.  His swimmers are immature (maybe the same as your DH's sleepys?)  Can I ask how many IUI's you had to do before your sucessful one? L  LisaRaw I took one round of clomid at the lowest dose & I now have 8 months old fraternal girls! I knew there was a small chance of it happening but thought "never to me!" Well here we are & I wouldn't change it for anything! :) J  JackieDowne @Hoping4aBabyin2012  Same with me. Took one round of the lowest dose and now i have almost 4 mo fraternal boys. We didn't find out it was twins until my 18 wk US we always only heard one heartbeat until then. Good luck! H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @JackieDowne  Did you have an IUI also? J  JackieDowne @Hoping4aBabyin2012  No I didn't have an IUI. I  IASoupMama @Hoping4aBabyin2012  We were successful on the second IUI, my third round of Clomid.  I actually conceived on the first round, but miscarried.  The second round wasn't timed well -- I thought my hormones were surging on the OPK, but was 2 days early.  The third round, the OPK was very clearly + (I now know it was because I was dropping multiple eggs, LOL!) and the IUI was perfect -- the nurse got the entire sample up there and there wasn't any "leakage." I don't know why DH's sperm quality took a nose dive -- we have a 6-year-old and an almost 4-year-old and were on month 18 of trying for #3 when I miscarried.  He made a crazy amount of sperm, but fewer than half of them had good motility. We were only going to do one more round of Clomid/IUI because I was deathly afraid of the next step -- injectable meds for me.  There's a MUCH higher chance of higher order multiples with the injectables and, given that I knew I was ovulating, I was beyond concerned that I would end up pregnant with quintuplets. I was also very glad that I did not need to take any more Clomid -- with each cycle I was feeling less and less like myself and more and more like a crazy hormonal wench.  My emotions were way out of control and I was miserable.  It was so much worse than any PMS or pregnancy mood swings and I felt terrible for having no patience with my kids or hubby. Good luck!! v  vwwife21 @LisaRaw  Just like you but our "small chance" turned into triplets. d  doulabliss My best friend just did her last IUI treatment and was going to do IVF but found out the IUI had worked and she is currently pregnant with triplets. H  Heather925 @Hoping4aBabyin2012  I'm pregnant for the second time, both times were from Clomid plus IUI. The first time was a singleton, and this time it's with twins. Good luck!!!

H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @MamaKing2010  I had 4 potential follicles...2 that were 14, a 17 and a 20.  Then there were 2 that were in the 12 range( maybe alittle smaller ) so they said they dont really could those....im hoping that some of the follicles had eggs!  fingers crossed!

By  Bianca Seidman  CBS News  September 24, 2015, 3:04 PM  Study tests success rates of common fertility drugs       Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Betsy Kilmartin and her husband tried to conceive a child for nine months with no success.  They saw a doctor to find out what could be causing the problem and found out there wasn't any specific biological cause -- it was what's considered unexplained infertility. "It's hard, you're on an emotional roller coaster," Kilmartin told CBS News. She used the drug clomiphene, or Clomid, to stimulate egg production and increase her chances of pregnancy.  A new study shows the drug, which has become one of the standard treatments for unexplained infertility , may be the best  option for couples like the Kilmartins. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 900 couples who had trouble conceiving for at least a year despite normal reproductive function. The study tested the different medications that can increase chances for healthy pregnancy, looking for the greatest success of a live birth with the lowest chance of having multiples , one of the main risk factors for fertility drugs. Researchers were particularly interested in comparing two common drugs that promote extra egg release to a newer treatment using an aromatase inhibitor called letrozole, which has shown promising pregnancy rates without increased birth defects in other studies. The study was conducted at 12 clinics across the U.S. by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Women in the study were between 18 and 40 years old and had male partners with sperm counts healthy enough for artificial insemination. Though in-vitro fertilization is also an option for women having difficulty conceiving, it is much less common because it is expensive and most insurance doesn't cover the process; using a drug to promote ovary stimulation is the most common therapy. This study tested three ovary-stimulating drugs that increase the odds for pregnancy by releasing more eggs : clomiphene (Clomid) and letrazole pills, and an injectable hormone called gonadotropin. The two pills were blind tested against one another. The results? "Clomid was much more efficient than letrozole, achieving a live birth rate of 23 percent," Dr. Tomer Singer of Lenox Hill Human Reproduction told CBS News.  "The letrozole group only achieved 18 percent." The rate of becoming pregnant with multiples -- twins or triplets -- differed among the medications significantly.  The clomiphene group had the fewest multiple babies born per pregnancy, at 5.7 percent, compared to 14.3 percent in the letrozole group and 13.4 percent in the group receiving gonadotropins. "Letrozole treatment offered no advantages over clomiphene treatment," study author Esther Eisenberg, M.D., of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of the NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said in a statement. "Women in the letrozole treatment group had fewer live births, but four times as many multiple pregnancies as women in the clomiphene group." Injected gonadotropin treatments resulted in the highest number of births, 32 percent, but many were multiples -- twins or even triplets.  The group receiving gonadotropin had 24 twins and 10 triplets, whereas multiples born to women in the other drug groups were all twins. Pregnancies with multiple fetuses can involve more complications, often leading to substantially lower birth weights and pre-term births. "There's a higher rate of c-sections, more diabetes, more preeclampsia," Singer said. Limitations of the study could have affected the results slightly, including the fact that because gonadotropin is an injectable instead of a pill it could not be blindly studied against the other drugs.  Additionally, the study was designed to compare current treatments using either Clomid or gonadotropin as one result versus the newer letrazole instead of studying the three drugs separately.  Lastly, no control group was included because researchers felt it would be unethical to deny real treatment to couples who were seeking fertility help after trying to conceive for between one and three years. Nevertheless, study researchers believe that the evidence is strong that current standard therapy using clomiphene remains the most effect way to stimulate ovaries and increase healthy pregnancy odds for couples with unexplained infertility. After her treatment with Clomid, Kilmartin became pregnant with her son Lucas, who is now almost two years old. "I love children, I've always wanted to be a mother," Kilmartin said. "It seemed like forever to get there." Following another round of treatment, she is now expecting the couple's second child.   © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Thanks in advance Marnsxx Marns 24 DHTB- Russ 32 DS- Riley 6th July 2001 DS- Connor 7th April 2004 MC 01/10/04 5 wks 2 days http://tinyurl.com/3...nyurl.com/64h6p       Back to top                #2   crazymum2twins    Posted 09 December 2004 - 02:39 PM    I was on Clomid for nearly 2 years, never ovulated once. Ended up on 4 tablets a day (think that's 200mg). I then went on to Puregon injections, and within 3 months was pregnant with twins. Puregon is waaaay cheaper then Clomid too, especially if you need more then 1 packet a month. As far as I know, Clomid still tends to make 1 dominant follical, so the chance of a multiple birth isn't as high as being on Puregon, or doing IVF where more then 1 egg is put back. All I can say is good luck, I hope Clomid works for you, but to be honest don't hang around on the stuff for too long, move on to other forms of fertility drugs if it isn't working at all. Took me 4 1/2 years to get pregnant!

I was just taking one tablet a day for 5 days(50mg?) We tried 2 more cycles and nothing and on our last cycle, I only had one dominant follicle, but fell pregnant with our twins! We found out at 7 weeks we were having twins and we have some family history of fraternal twins so? Jackson and Hayden are now healthy gorgeous 10 month old boys! (Just a touch biased!) Hope that helps.. Let me know if I can help further Rhonda DH 37 Jackson 21/01/04 Hayden 21/01/04     Back to top                #4   twinmomma    Posted 09 December 2004 - 03:07 PM    That would be me!  We successfully conceived on a fairly low dose of Clomid, after about 5 cycles.  We sought help with secondary infertility after being unsuccessful for nearly 18 months TTC.  My specialist discovered I wasn't ovulating every cycle so my chances of conceiving were very slim, also my cycles varied in length so it was nearly impossible to predict when I might be ovulating.  I started out on 1/2 then moved on to 1 1/2 tabs and BINGO!!!!!....TWINS!

Im wanting to know also because I have done some reading and if you already ovulate normally- I did ovulate on my own between m/c and cycle of clomid- then it can potentially act like a higher dose of clomid anyway as your body is getting extra hormones from the clomid and some from your body fuinctioning normally- does this make sense? Ill have to keep reading I think!

I was on clomid 100mg .. I was a twin (twin died in utero), and paternal grandmother had twins .. lost in late second tri ... so the family history carried through me ...... 2 clomid babies due to polycystic ovaries and no twins. My friend was on 50mg clomid, no family history and bingo twins first and only clomid cycle .... OB thinks she O'd herself that cycle as well. So I do not think it really matters too much guess like any pregnancy just the luck of the draw!!

I recognise your name and the gorgeous photos of your children from the Clomidians TTC thread!  I am a graduate from the clomidians but pop in there now and then.  And yes, I conceived twins on clomid.  I also have a family history of twins so who knows which is the contributor, maybe both? I started on 50mg for my first 2 cycles but for some reason O'd on my first but not on my second so they upped me to 100mg for my third.  My levels for my third were what they consider to be low ie 17 as they apparently like you to be in the 20's or 30's for assisted conception.  So my gyno upped me to 150mg for my 4th cycle and whammo - twins!  Even though my BT showed only a level of 14.  Bissett in your thread also conceived with a level of 13 so I don't know why they insist on stressing everyone out with seeking higher levels? I am not sure if the higher dosage 150mg is what did it or the family history? but I know there is a slightly higher chance of multiple pg's on clomid. I hope this helps!

I am on clomid n secretly wishing BG twins! just wanted to know how many of you got twins from clomid only and what r u having? how many rounds did it take u n what dose                   Status: Offline                       Aug 20th, 2012, 07:23 AM   2       TatorMom    Mum (Mom)  Active BnB Member    Join Date: Jul 2012  Location: Ohio, USA  Posts: 662        The increased chance of twins is pretty small, even with clomid. I did 3 rounds of Clomid and never got pregnant. We had our boys naturally after miscarriages and got pregnant with twins without fertility treatments. I had been looking forward to having just 1 baby for our 3rd because our boys are so close in age I wasn't able to enjoy them when they were tiny. I wasn't surprised that I was pregnant with twins for some reason, but a part of me was sad I was going to miss out on having just 1 baby to focus on. We're very excited though and having 2 so close in age, and so many twins mom's telling us they thing multiples are easier than having kids so close in age, I don't feel that twinge of sadness quite as much. It's always been funny to have twin mom's tell us we have our hands full I do think they're right though. I definitely wouldn't have TRIED for twins, but everyone is different and had different coping abilities. We see the benifits of having our boys so close, and were going to have #3 and #4 close as well because of it, so frankly I'm glad we're having twins, so I only have to go through 1 pregnancy and we can move on and enjoy life with older kids. The baby stage isn't my favorite.  Good luck!

And there are TONS of risks involved.  But to answer your question, I had 6 IUI's before my BFP.  The last two cycles I was on 100mg of Clomid and I took Ovidril.  My last cycle I released 3 eggs, and the Dr said that the chances of all three taking were pretty slim, but that I could very well conceive twins.  I ended up with triplets.  LOL  And while I've adjusted to the news now (as I was not too happy about the idea of triplets to begin with) and I'm excited to be having them, the pregnancy has been VERY uncomfortable.

Hi there ladies,  My DH and I are having problems conceiving our first child and my RE has put me on Clomid next cycle, starting on the weekend when my dreaded AF is due.  I'm starting on 50mg and my doctor has directed me to take the dose from days 2-6. I've read online that taking Clomid early in the cycle can increase the chances of multiples and I was just interested to know if what I have read online regarding this is accurate from a point of view of your experiences.  Also, did you find the side effects all that bad? I've read taking it at night is helpful in relieving some of the known side effects.  We are hoping we conceive soon so that I don't have to take the drug for too long.  Congratulations on your pregnancy/families and hopefully I'll be joining you in motherhood very soon with either one or more babies. God willing.  Best wishes to you all and thanks so much for reading my post.

(I'm thinking mine may be identical though which would mean it didn't have anything to do with it.)  I took it days 3-7.  I didn't have an U/S until 8 weeks and at that point they only found one cyst they were pretty sure was a CL.  I had a couple other cysts, but they didn't see the jagged edges they would expect from a CL.  The first cycle I didn't get it until CD4 for took it days 4-8, but didn't conceive.  I did get hot flashes from the Letrozole, but from what I'm told Letrozole is much more mild than Clomid and leaves your system quicker.

I don't think it ha much to do with what day you start but rather how many mature follicles you have. Maybe taking it earlier gives a chance for more follicles to grow? I'm not sure. As for side effects, I learned the hard way that it's best to take it at night. The first day I took it in the afternoon and had such bad hot flashes tht I literally stuck my head on the freezer as the a/c did nothing to help. After that, I still had the hot flashes but not nearly as bad because I slept through the worst of it. That is really the only side effect I remember. I know I had more but they weren't bad enough that I remember what they were.  Hopefully you get your BFP soon.

Thanks so much ladies for responding. I know it's not a forgone conclusion that I'll conceive with Clomid alone but I'm keep the faith that it will hopefully bring us one step closer to being parents.  My doctor has suggested that we time intercourse this month with an Ovidrel trigger once we know how many follicles we have. I've read that some people get super intense cramping with it when ovulating - did anybody experience this? I'm a big chicken!

Hello ladies! I found out today that I am expecting. And of course I am obsessing. I got pregnant while using clomid, 3 cycles to be exact. I had 2 follicles, and now I am wondering if my chances of having twins is now actually higher because I myself am a twin. I am also still breastfeeding, and I have heard that can make your chances higher. I have always wanted twins, because I love the bond that I have with my brother.  Am I thinking too much into this? Has anyone else taken clomid as a twin, and got pregnant with twins??

Identical twins are.  Fraternal twins are dizygomatic (come from two separate eggs and sperm, so they are not unlike any regular (non-twin) siblings.  :-)  Not sure on the Clomid or whatnot, but I don't believe the fact that you are a fraternal twin will effect the outcome of having twins yourself (I have never heard of double-ovulating to be a genetic quality).

He cannot make you ovulate more than one egg. Having said that, if you are a fraternal twin, then it must run in your mums side so therefore you have a chance. Also I know a lot of ladies on BnB that have taken clomid and went onnto have twins(some even triplets) so that could increase your chances too. Pop over to the twins and multiple section and have a chat with them if you like, the can tell you more. Good luck.

X     Sorry heather1 but chetnaz is correct.  Identicals are just a fluke of nature when during cell separation in the early stage of pregnancy, the egg separates completely leaving two separate embryo's.  Non identical twins are caused by double ovulation which Is a genetic thing running down the female side of the family.  To the op - as you were on clomid I guess you'll never know if the two follicles were due to genetics and your twin history of as a result of the clomid.  Your husbands side of the family have no affect on this. Also you won't know if it's a singleton or twin pregnancy until you're scanned.

Identicals are just a fluke of nature when during cell separation in the early stage of pregnancy, the egg separates completely leaving two separate embryo's.  Non identical twins are caused by double ovulation which Is a genetic thing running down the female side of the family.  To the op - as you were on clomid I guess you'll never know if the two follicles were due to genetics and your twin history of as a result of the clomid.  Your husbands side of the family have no affect on this. Also you won't know if it's a singleton or twin pregnancy until you're scanned. HTH     Yup, as I said a little earlier...  Already corrected myself.  Thanks though.

You are only likely to get multiples if the clomid causes you to create and release more Han one follicle.  Are you being monitored with u/s? If so they will be able to tell you if you prepare and release multiple eggs.  Obliviously the one egg could split and create identical twins but that is not any more of a risk than in the normal population.

I am currently on day 7 of provera to jump start AF again. She has stayed away since 2007. I'm suppose to take provera for 10 days and have a visit fr AF 5 days later, cross my fingers. Then, I will start clomid days 5-9 of my cycle. I won't be having ultra sounds this month, which is why I'm nervous. Doc says he will up me to 100 mg and Ultra sounds next month if I don't get a BFP this month.

That still gives you a 90 - 92% chance of NOT having multiples.  I am not a betting person but given those differences in odds you are probably safe to only have 1 if you get a BFP but you have to be ok with twins when you move to fertility drugs              Status: Offline                               Apr 28th, 2011, 13:43 PM   5       MrandMrs    Trying to conceive (TTC)  Active BnB Member    Join Date: Apr 2011  Posts: 26        I am very willing to take whatever I am blessed with.

Im rooting for you and hoping you get your BFP soon!!  MrandMrs, good luck with your first round of clomid! I am waiting (impatiently) to see the FS June 3rd where I will be prescribed Clomid (or so I am told) I just finished 10 days of provera and going to be doing CD22 bloodwork and hubby is doing SA next weekend.  I am actually a twin myself (my mom concieved twins naturally and her sister, my aunt, had twins also!) I wonder if me being a twin and taking clomid increases my chances of multiples? hmm... Id be okay with one or two. three or more is a little scary though ;-)                  Status: Offline                   May 8th, 2011, 22:29 PM   9       Mrs. Bear    Pregnant (Expecting)  BnB Addict        Join Date: Nov 2010  Location: USA  Posts: 3,217        My sister had twin girls her first round of 50mg clomid - that is the exception not the rule though.

I started on 50 mg of Clomid last summer (cd 5-9), after a couple cycles they upped it to 100 mg and I got pregnant in November, which ended in an early chemical pregnancy loss.  Bumped me back to 50 mg, and here I am the very next cycle, preggo with twins couldn't be happier.  I have a set of fraternal twin second or third cousins, but that's IT on either side.

Many couples who are facing this issue will seek professional treatment in order to achieve a pregnancy. One of the most common methods of treating infertility is through a drug that is known as Clomid. Clomid, or clomiphine citrate, is used to stimulate eggs so that more are developed and then released by the ovaries. It is taken by mouth once per day for the 5 days prior to an ovulation period.  Statistics on Clomid Multiples  1. Women who take Clomid have successful single birth pregnancies 92% of the time.  2. For women who conceive while taking Clomid, the chances of having twins is 5-10%.  3. The chances for a woman to have triplets while on Clomid is 0.5%.  4. The percentage of women who conceive twins without the use of fertility treatments: 1.2%.  5. Clomid is not responsible for multiple births when men are taking it.  6. Clomid will cause a pregnancy in most couples who are attempting to conceive within 6 months. A majority of women will conceive within the first 90 days.  7. Some women will still have Clomid in their system 6 weeks after stopping it.  8. Of the reported pregnancies in Clomid studies, the incidence of multiple pregnancies was 7.98%.  9. The ratio of monozygotic to dizygotic twins was about 1:5.  10. The survival rate of multiple births that occur from Clomid is 83.25%, compared to the 73% survival rate of infants born without fertility treatments.  11. Specific fetal abnormalities were all reported to be under 1%.  12. Every monthly attempt to conceive with Clomid results in a 15-20% pregnancy rate per attempt.  13. 80% of women taking clomiphene citrate will successfully ovulate, but fewer than 50% of patients will conceive.  14. One study showed that 87% of the women who ovulated but failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate had an additional cause of infertility such as pelvic lesions, tubal disease, endometriosis, male factor infertility, or a combination of these issues.  15. The success rates are less than 15% per cycle even when combined with IUI for patients that have unexplained infertility issues.  16. The average cost for Clomid for a cycle is about $40.  17. The average cost for generic clomiphene citrate is about $15.  18. Pregnancies are very rarely higher than triplets, but have been known to occur. There is one clinically documented pregnancy of sextuplets that has occurred with Clomid.  19. Hot flashes are sometimes experienced as a side effect of Clomid. These are similar to the hot flashes that menopausal women experience.  20. 72% of the women who take Clomid wind up visiting their OBGYN for birthing assistance because of the treatments.  21. The vast majority (80%) of women who are prescribed Clomid have menstrual irregularity due to polycystic ovary syndrome.  22. For women above the age of 35, the success rate of Clomid drops to about 6%-8% per cycle as a direct result of aging.  23. 2% of women who take Clomid report having visual side effects.   Risks and Additional Information  Because the ovaries are stimulated by this drug, there is a possibility of having twins or triplets because of the amount of eggs that are released. It also increases the overall chances of a couple achieving a pregnancy. It may be a popular drug, but the side effects of it can sometimes be serious. Most mild side effects, such as throwing up or feeling warm, can be treated at home. Weight gain, cysts, or changes in vision should be treated by a doctor immediately.  There are also some risks associated with Clomid that are not always commonly known before treatment begins. For women who take this drug in prolonged doses, there is an increased risk of burying cancer developing. Multiple pregnant are the other, more obvious risk. Mothers that have a pregnancy of multiples face unique challenges that singleton pregnancies do not always face.  With the success rates of this drug, however, most couples who are struggling to achieve a pregnancy are willing to take on these risks. As you can see in the statistics, not only are the chances of having a single birth very likely when Clomid is taken, but the chances of having multiple births increases as well.      Important Facts About Clomid  There are known causes of infertility, Clomid can be very successful in treating it. If infertility is being caused by unknown factors, this drug is not as successful.  What makes Clomid such a useful fertility treatment is that it works in both men and women. Not only can it stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, but it can support the development of sperm cells within men as well. This means that any infertility issue that a couple faces may be solved thanks to this very affordable wonder drug. Although success is not guaranteed, major studies have shown that only 8% of women who are exposed to this drug are unable to achieve a pregnancy.  Having multiples does regularly happen when taking Clomid, but the odds are still that a single birth is going to happen. Only about one in 10 mothers will have a multiples birth. And when that happens, twins are the most likely outcome. Fewer than one in 100 Clomid pregnancies results in the creation of triplets.  What is interesting about Clomid is that certain women seem to be resistant to the drug. The regular dose is 50 mg every day, but some women do not even respond when 150 mg is used as a treatment option. Women who are resistant to Clomid will typically not have a successful fertility treatment with this drug need to look at other options.  With no enhancement of miscarriage rates and potentially better long-term survival rates for infants were born, many couples have found Clomid to be a successful treatment option. That is why this drug is so popular today.

Clomid is a super popular and commonly prescribed fertility drug all over the world.    All about Clomid  If you are just beginning on your fertility journey, chances are that you have already heard of Clomid. Clomid is a super popular and commonly prescribed fertility drug all over the world. When a woman seeks fertility help, Clomid is often a doctor’s first choice for treatment, and helps to jump start ovulation in many women. Clomid helps to stimulate the ovaries and help to make sure that a woman is ovulating. When a woman is taking Clomid, her body is producing more follicles and hormones than usual, and estrogen levels are also increased. Sometimes, while on Clomid, a woman can produce more than one mature egg. If these eggs are fertilized, then a woman will have twins. Clomid does increase chances of having twins , but not as much as you might think. Keep reading for more information on Clomid twins and just how common they are. Claim Your 20 Free Pregnancy Tests – Click Here   Likelihood of Clomid twins  The chance of getting pregnant with twins naturally, without any fertility drugs, is not very high at all, only between 1 and 3 percent. Many people think that by taking Clomid, women increase their chance of having twins very dramatically, but that is not actually the case. We do hear about Clomid twins quite often on blogs or online message boards, but the chances of having Clomid twins really is not that great. The chance of having twins while taking Clomid is only around 8-10 percent, so it does increase a woman’s chances, but not that much. When it comes to multiples, the chance of conceiving them while taking Clomid is even more rare. Only one percent of Clomid pregnancies result in triplets or higher order multiples.   More info on Clomid twins  While some women might plan to use Clomid to get pregnant with twins on purpose, that is definitely not advisable. Twins can cause pregnancy complications, and put both mother and baby at a higher risk. Women younger than 25 are much more likely to have twins while taking Clomid. Obviously, if a woman who doesn’t have any problems ovulating, she doesn’t need Clomid. Taking Clomid when you don’t need to makes twins much more likely, as does taking more than the recommended dosage. Always follow your doctor’s orders when it comes to Clomid and never take it without close supervision by a doctor. Even if you really want to have twins, taking Clomid without following doctor’s orders can be very dangerous. As with all sorts of drugs, only take Clomid as directed and stay in close contact with your doctor to make sure that you get the best results.

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

It is the most commonly used fertility drug . Because Clomid can be prescribed by a gynecologist and doesn't require a fertility specialist, it's also the very first fertility treatment tried for most couples. Clomid is taken as a pill. This is unlike the stronger fertility drugs, which require injection. Clomid is also very effective, stimulating ovulation 80 percent of the time.         Clomid may also be marketed under the name Serophene, or you may see it sold under its generic name, clomiphene citrate. Note: Clomid can also be used as a treatment for male infertility. This article focuses on Clomid treatment in women. When Is Clomid Used? If a woman has irregular cycles , or anovulatory cycles (menstruation without ovulation), Clomid may be tried first. Clomid is often used in treating polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) related infertility It may also be used in cases of unexplained infertility or when a couple prefers not to use the more expensive and invasive fertility treatments. (However, it's important to remember that the more expensive treatment is sometimes the most appropriate.) Clomid may also be used during an IUI (intrauterine insemination) procedure. It is rarely used during IVF treatment. With IVF, injectable ovulation medications are more frequently chosen. When Is Clomid Not the Best Choice? Clomid may not be for you if...   You have blocked fallopian tubes , fibroids, or other uterine abnormalities. You have an ovarian cyst. (This is not the same as having the tiny cysts that accompany polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) .) You’re dealing with male infertility . (Unless we’re talking about Clomid for men. ) You have low ovarian reserves , either due to age or primary ovarian insufficiency (formerly known as premature ovarian failure).         Your ovulation problems would be better solved by other treatments. (For example, in a woman with hyperprolactinemia , treating the hyperprolactinemia would be the preferred first step.) You have a hormone-reactive tumor, which may grow with Clomid use, or you have a history of certain cancers. You’ve reacted poorly to Clomid treatment in the past. Can Clomid Help You Get Pregnant Faster if You Have No Fertility Problems? If you have problems with ovulation , Clomid may help you ovulate. But what if you don’t have ovulation problems? A study of over 1,000 women looked at whether Clomid could help women who were having trouble getting pregnant but were not having ovulation problems. When comparing women who took Clomid with women who received either a placebo or no treatment, researchers found that there was no improvement in pregnancy rates, even when Clomid was coupled with IUI treatment . (IUI is insemination.) It’s not unheard of for a woman to lie to her doctor to get Clomid, thinking it will help her conceive faster. Not only will it likely not help her get pregnant faster, but now she’s at risk for experiencing side effects. (Some of those side effects reduce your fertility. More on this below.)         How Is Clomid Taken? You should follow the directions your doctor gives you. Every doctor has a slightly different protocol. With that said, the most common dosage of Clomid is 50 mg taken for five days, on Days 3 through 7 of your cycle. Some doctors prefer you take the pills on Days 5 through 9 of your cycle. Does it matter if your doctor suggests the Day 3 to 7 protocol or the Day 5 to 9 one? Not really. Ovulation and pregnancy rates have been shown to be similar whether the drug is started on day two, three, four, or five. Clomid Day by Day: What to Expect, What's Happening in Your Body Don't feel concerned if your doctor tells you a different protocol to follow than your friend.  If 50 mg doesn't work, your doctor may increase the medication. Or, they may give it another try at 50 mg. You might think that more is always better, but higher doses, especially at or above 150 mg, can make conception more difficult. (See below, under side effects.) When Should You Have Sex When Taking Clomid? To get pregnant when taking Clomid , you need to have sexual intercourse when you are most fertile. This will be the few days just before ovulation. This varies slightly from person to person, but most women ovulate 7 to 10 days after the last Clomid pill was taken. This means you are most likely to ovulate somewhere between Day 14 and 19 of your cycle. To have sex during your most fertile time (which is the two to three days before you ovulate), you may want to consider having sex every other day start on Day 11 and ending on Day 21. Or, another option is to use an ovulation predictor test to detect your most fertile time. Whenever the test indicates you're fertile, have sex that day and the next few days. If you're also having a trigger shot (injection of hCG) during your Clomid cycle, your doctor will instruct you to have sexual intercourse on the day of the injection and the two following days. For example, if you have the injection on Monday, you should have sex on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. What are Clomid's Common Side Effects? Clomid's side effects aren't so bad, as far as fertility drugs are concerned. The most common side effects are hot flashes, breast tenderness, mood swings, and nausea. Once the medication is stopped, the side effects will leave, too. Possible side effects of Clomid include: Enlarged and tender ovaries (14 percent) Hot flashes (11 percent) Abdominal tenderness, due to enlarged and tender ovaries (7.4 percent) Bloating (5.5 percent) Breast tenderness (2.1 percent) Vaginal dryness or thicker cervical mucus (percentage of occurrence not available) Nausea and vomiting (2.2 percent) Anxiety and insomnia (1.9 percent) Vision disturbances (1.6 percent) Headache (1.3 percent) Abnormal uterine bleeding (spotting) (0.5 percent) Mood swings and fatigue (0.3 percent) One of the more ironic side effects to comprehend is that Clomid can decrease the quality of your cervical mucus . This can cause problems with sperm being able to move easily through the cervix, making conception more difficult. Clomid can also make the lining of your uterus thinner and less ideal for implantation. This is why "more" is not necessarily better when it comes to Clomid dosage and use. What Are the Chances That You'll Conceive Twins? The side effect you're probably most familiar with is the risk of multiples. It's not nearly as common as you may think it is. You have a 10 percent chance of having twins when taking Clomid. This means that 1 in 10 pregnancies conceived with Clomid lead to twins. This doesn’t mean you should brush off the risk of having a multiple birth. Only that you shouldn’t assume Clomid will get you twins. Triplets or quadruplets on Clomid are rare, happening less than 1 percent of the time. Are the Mood Swings of Clomid Real? Clomid does mess with your hormones, and your hormones do have an effect on your emotional well-being . Research on mood swings while taking Clomid indicate a much higher rate than the initial clinical trials of the drug. The clinical trials reported that only 0.3 percent of women experienced mood swings or fatigue. That breaks down to 3 in 1,000 patients. However, later research found that between 40 and 45 percent of women experienced mood swings. That's almost one in every two women. The "Clomid Crazies" are a bit like PMS mood swings—but slightly worse. However, if you experience severe mood swings on Clomid, be sure to contact your doctor. How Successful Is Clomid? Clomid will jump-start ovulation in 80 percent of patients, but ovulating doesn't guarantee pregnancy will occur. About 40 to 45 percent of women using Clomid will get pregnant within six cycles of use. While Clomid does help many women ovulate, obviously it's not always successful. When Clomid does not result in ovulation , we say the woman is Clomid resistant . (This isn't the same as when Clomid does trigger ovulation but doesn't lead to pregnancy.) What happens when Clomid doesn’t work? You won’t necessarily need to move up to more complicated treatments right away. Your doctor may prescribe the diabetes drug metformin to take alongside Clomid. Or, they may move you onto a drug called letrozole. Letrozole —which is a cancer treatment drug used off-label for infertility—has been found to help women ovulate who are Clomid resistant. For How Many Cycles Can You Take Clomid? Clomid should not be used indefinitely. One reason for that is the possible increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Several studies have looked into whether fertility drugs increase your odds for cancer. The good news is that most studies link infertility itself, and not Clomid use, to the higher risk of cancer. This means if Clomid helps you get pregnant, just getting pregnant and having a baby will decrease your cancer risk. The bad news is that some studies have found that cancer risk goes up if you’re treated with Clomid over an extended time, even when compared to other infertile women who don’t conceive. Even though research seems to indicate that infertility itself is the cause for increased cancer odds, just to be safe, most doctors recommend limiting treatment to 12 months. Some prefer to be extra cautious and limit treatment to six months. Can You Buy Clomid Online Without a Prescription? There are reputable pharmacy websites where you can fill a prescription for Clomid, but you should never try taking Clomid without a doctor's supervision. First of all, the only way to purchase Clomid without a prescription is via illegal and shady websites. You have no idea who is selling you the drugs and no way to know if you're getting Clomid or something else. Secondly, even though Clomid treatment is relatively simple, it is not for everyone, and it can be harmful. You should never buy Clomid online without a prescription.

I am 30 yrs old and always had slightly irregular periods. The cycles could range from 30 days to 45 days… After a couple of months of trying to conceive with my husband, my period suddenly stopped altogether for a couple of months for no reason. I tested negative on pregnancy tests. So I got 50mg of Clomid that i took for one course on cd3-7 and i immediately became pregnant with twins! My insurance didn’t cover Clomid. So I got it online to save money. My sister gave me the code “CLO4MULT” and she said ‘just Google it’.                 JaneRenfrow    Answered 6/16/17               31 found this helpful     For women who don't ovulate on their own the chances of concieving twins on Clomid is reported to be about 1/20 and signifigantly less for triplets or higher order multiples. BUT.... For a woman who ovulates regularly, (on her own without medication,) the chances of concieving multiples on Clomid signifigantly increases. Clomid basically tricks your body into producing more Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) which does pretty much what it sounds like... Stimulates follicles in the ovaries to produce mutiple mature eggs to be realeased at ovulation. If more than one egg is released, fertilized by a man's sperm, and they all implant in the uturine lining then you end up pregnant with multiples.                 katie13440    Answered 12/13/11               31 found this helpful     I have just found out that I am having triplets from clomid after 11 years of ttc.

Many couples who are facing this issue will seek professional treatment in order to achieve a pregnancy. One of the most common methods of treating infertility is through a drug that is known as Clomid. Clomid, or clomiphine citrate, is used to stimulate eggs so that more are developed and then released by the ovaries. It is taken by mouth once per day for the 5 days prior to an ovulation period.  Statistics on Clomid Multiples  1. Women who take Clomid have successful single birth pregnancies 92% of the time.  2. For women who conceive while taking Clomid, the chances of having twins is 5-10%.  3. The chances for a woman to have triplets while on Clomid is 0.5%.  4. The percentage of women who conceive twins without the use of fertility treatments: 1.2%.  5. Clomid is not responsible for multiple births when men are taking it.  6. Clomid will cause a pregnancy in most couples who are attempting to conceive within 6 months. A majority of women will conceive within the first 90 days.  7. Some women will still have Clomid in their system 6 weeks after stopping it.  8. Of the reported pregnancies in Clomid studies, the incidence of multiple pregnancies was 7.98%.  9. The ratio of monozygotic to dizygotic twins was about 1:5.  10. The survival rate of multiple births that occur from Clomid is 83.25%, compared to the 73% survival rate of infants born without fertility treatments.  11. Specific fetal abnormalities were all reported to be under 1%.  12. Every monthly attempt to conceive with Clomid results in a 15-20% pregnancy rate per attempt.  13. 80% of women taking clomiphene citrate will successfully ovulate, but fewer than 50% of patients will conceive.  14. One study showed that 87% of the women who ovulated but failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate had an additional cause of infertility such as pelvic lesions, tubal disease, endometriosis, male factor infertility, or a combination of these issues.  15. The success rates are less than 15% per cycle even when combined with IUI for patients that have unexplained infertility issues.  16. The average cost for Clomid for a cycle is about $40.  17. The average cost for generic clomiphene citrate is about $15.  18. Pregnancies are very rarely higher than triplets, but have been known to occur. There is one clinically documented pregnancy of sextuplets that has occurred with Clomid.  19. Hot flashes are sometimes experienced as a side effect of Clomid. These are similar to the hot flashes that menopausal women experience.  20. 72% of the women who take Clomid wind up visiting their OBGYN for birthing assistance because of the treatments.  21. The vast majority (80%) of women who are prescribed Clomid have menstrual irregularity due to polycystic ovary syndrome.  22. For women above the age of 35, the success rate of Clomid drops to about 6%-8% per cycle as a direct result of aging.  23. 2% of women who take Clomid report having visual side effects.   Risks and Additional Information  Because the ovaries are stimulated by this drug, there is a possibility of having twins or triplets because of the amount of eggs that are released. It also increases the overall chances of a couple achieving a pregnancy. It may be a popular drug, but the side effects of it can sometimes be serious. Most mild side effects, such as throwing up or feeling warm, can be treated at home. Weight gain, cysts, or changes in vision should be treated by a doctor immediately.  There are also some risks associated with Clomid that are not always commonly known before treatment begins. For women who take this drug in prolonged doses, there is an increased risk of burying cancer developing. Multiple pregnant are the other, more obvious risk. Mothers that have a pregnancy of multiples face unique challenges that singleton pregnancies do not always face.  With the success rates of this drug, however, most couples who are struggling to achieve a pregnancy are willing to take on these risks. As you can see in the statistics, not only are the chances of having a single birth very likely when Clomid is taken, but the chances of having multiple births increases as well.      Important Facts About Clomid  There are known causes of infertility, Clomid can be very successful in treating it. If infertility is being caused by unknown factors, this drug is not as successful.  What makes Clomid such a useful fertility treatment is that it works in both men and women. Not only can it stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, but it can support the development of sperm cells within men as well. This means that any infertility issue that a couple faces may be solved thanks to this very affordable wonder drug. Although success is not guaranteed, major studies have shown that only 8% of women who are exposed to this drug are unable to achieve a pregnancy.  Having multiples does regularly happen when taking Clomid, but the odds are still that a single birth is going to happen. Only about one in 10 mothers will have a multiples birth. And when that happens, twins are the most likely outcome. Fewer than one in 100 Clomid pregnancies results in the creation of triplets.  What is interesting about Clomid is that certain women seem to be resistant to the drug. The regular dose is 50 mg every day, but some women do not even respond when 150 mg is used as a treatment option. Women who are resistant to Clomid will typically not have a successful fertility treatment with this drug need to look at other options.  With no enhancement of miscarriage rates and potentially better long-term survival rates for infants were born, many couples have found Clomid to be a successful treatment option. That is why this drug is so popular today.

This is my first month on clomid, and I have an HSG tomorrow and will be using a trigger shot. I've been thinking a lot about the possibility of multiples with this much intervention. Dr said multiple rate on clomid is about 10%, but if love to hear any stories you ladies have! Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  42 Posts s  sablal2 We did! Found out we were having twins at 7 weeks pregnant. First cycle of chlomid with ovidrel injection. Reply  Close b  babylulu611 You should ask this on the infertility board, you will get a more realistic response as everyone here has twins. For all the people who have twins conceived with clomid there are many many more who only conceived one. I said to another poster if you walked into a room of lung cancer patients and said "I have a cough, could it be cancer?" A lot of them would say "maybe, I had a cough", whereas if you ask the general population most people will tell you they just have a cold. Reply  Close l  labrady @babylulu611  I guess what I'm interested in is not how many people on clomid have twins. But out of all of you mommies that have multiples, how many were taking clomid. If that makes sense! :) Reply  Close l  labrady @sablal2  I'm doing clomid and ovadril too. It's funny, one of my best friends had fraternal twins naturally and 5 years later had a single with clomid, ovadril and IUI. Guess you never know!! Reply  Close b  babyb-z @labrady  Twins here on the second round of 50mg clomid + trigger shot. We were so shocked! Our doc had said up to 15% chance of twins, but we still assumed we'd only have one. Reply  Close m  moonlight00 I did! Though the first round of IUI, there was only a singleton who failed to develop and I had a D&C around 8 weeks. The second time around, the doc spotted 2 sacs but only one bean. It took us 2 more ultrasounds to spot the second twin. Reply  Close A  Allie622 I did conceive twins on clomid, currently almost 18 weeks. I was on my 5th round of 100mg clomid, no shots. Reply  Close F  FTMKay I think the rate of twinning naturally is 3% vs 8% with Clomid (based on what our fertility doctor told us) so Clomid does raise your chances but not by much. Looking at it from a difference perspective, the "risk" of having a singleton naturally is 97% vs 92% with Clomid. So very, very likely it'll only be one either way :-) Reply  Close l  lgthompson Me. 4th round of clomid, 50mg. But I have lots and lots of friends who had singletons on clomid. Chances normally are 3%, clomid brings it up to 7-8%. So not drastically higher. Reply  Close e  ecmewton My first was from Clomid, trigger shot, and IUI. 3 follicles were large enough to ovulate, and resulted in just one single baby. Fast forward 5 years, we are spontaneously pregnant with identical twins. Ha! Reply  Close K  Kellib83 In less than a few hours My husband and I head to the hospital at 38 weeks prego to deliver my twin girls! I never imagined twins but last June I had a misscarriage and in October my doc gave me 4 days of some estrogen suppressant to get my cycle regular again and holy cow I'm now having twins! I had no idea the drug could influence my fertility or rate of having twins but I read it increases the chances up to 3 or so %... After the fact! We r still in so much shock! And I obviously can't sleep tonight lol good luck everyone! Reply  Close h  hbroski 5th round of clomid (no shots) with only one fallopian tube due to an ectopic pregnancy in my left tube that ruptured & could not be repaired so it had to be completely removed 7 months prior to conceiving my b/g twins. Found out there were 2 buns in the oven around 8 weeks. Reply  Close S  Shwhite @labrady  I'm totally not trying to be rude, but you already know the rate. It really is: 8-10% of pregnancies resulting from the use of clomid will result in multiple births. I'm only pointing this out because I want to answer whatever underlying questions you may have about the process or general experience. If you really do just want to know that people here did end up with multiples on clomid, I did. It was after one round of clomid and a trigger injection with IUI. Reply  Close l  labrady @Shwhite  No ulterior motive, was just curious to hear people's stories. Did they take clomid, did they use a trigger, etc. I'd had it in my mind that multiples wouldn't be something we would have to think about unless we had to get all the way to IVF. I was shocked when my dr mentioned it several times in our clomid conversation! (This is our first month using a fertility specialist) Thank you all for taking the time to respond, I really do appreciate it! It was fun to read all of your stories, and congrats on your babies! Reply  Close P  PWoodworth I actually did 5 rounds IUI with estrogen, trigger shot, clomid and then progesterone. Ironically, none of those cycles worked for me. My doctor switched me to letrozole instead because the clomid over time thinned out my endometrial lining too much. First cycle replacing clomid with letrozole and here I am 33w with twins :) I wanted to share this because too many women hear about clomid and think that if it doesn't work, they have to go to IVF when there are other options out there. The 6 total IUIs I had were with two different doctors (took 5 years for my miracle to happen) so hang in there! Reply  Close s  sammipacheco11 I didn't get pregnant at all with Clomid. We ended up doing IVF and now are expecting twins. Reply  Close g  greeneggsam I did Clomid "plain" (3x), Clomid + IUI (2x), but did not conceive.  We used IVF (2x) to conceive our identical girls. I think doctors over-prescribe Clomid.  My husband and I had been timing everything right for a year, and the first two docs I saw both gave me Clomid.  In short, if you believe you have an ovulation issue, Clomid can help.  But, if you feel, like I did, that ovulation was not the issue, you're wasting your time.  Tell your doctor you want to go on to something else.  I wasted 6 months trying stuff that I just knew wouldn't work... Reply  Close l  labrady @greeneggsam  Great info! Ovulation is totally my issue- I ovulate, but my eggs are poor quality. I usually ovulate day 16-18 and only have 26 day cycles. My progesterone has never been above 7, so my body doesn't create the healthy uterine lining for an embryo to attach to. Dr prescribed clomid to improve egg quality and trigger shot to force me to ovulate earlier. We're hopeful that clomid with do the trick quickly. I go Monday to check my follicles! After months of ttc and a miscarriage, everything makes so much sense after meeting with an RE specialist! Reply  Close b  babymama0927 We conceived twins with Famara, FSH shots, trigger shot and an IUI :) clomid never worked for us. Good luck!!

The thought of twins, tho a double blessing, scares the petunias out of me! I would be happy but so worried the entire pregnancy and beyond.

Reply  Close h  hogan814 We did several cycles of clomid that were unsuccessful, but from what I remember, the odds of multiples averaged about 10%, but were more likely with increased doses.

Currently 28+1 weeks. I knew there was a risk of multiples on the medication but you always think it won't happen to you! Reply  Close 3  3stoogesmommy @hogan814  Wow that's amazing. I've heard that clomid and such can build up in your system I wonder if it still played a role on your twins? I will be happy with one or two and over the moon!

Reply  Close 3  3stoogesmommy @hurah  Exactly lol yes risk is there but come on, twins... I didn't put any thought to it my first few lower dose cycles but this 100mg cy me has my mind spinning with what ifs! And the fact that I do ovulate just poorly.. kinda nerve racking I guess so it's an obvious that yea clomid can cause multiples, hopefully just not in elephant babies, tho I would love then either way  ?? Reply  Close h  hogan814 @3stoogesmommy  I'm sure it did play a role. I was still shocked though when they said twins. Now we're 35+4 in and sometimes in still in denial lol Reply  Close h  hopecows I've taken no fertility drugs whatsoever and am pregnant with twins. Some times it's just genes. Had anyone asked their family if multiples run in their family on the mother's side? Reply  Close T  Tahda No Chlomid here. And no twins on my side.

Reply  Close 3  3stoogesmommy @hopecows  That's a good question! I only have two sets in my family that I know of .

But how does that play out? my mother's grandma had multiples but it was her father's mother so would that not count? so confusing lol. And what a wonderful freak accident for you hehe x 2 lol Reply  Close 2  22Blessed I did 2 rounds of Clomid, both at 100mg. The first try nothing the second, got pregnant with twins. Like someone said earlier, we were also nervous about twins, my doctor said 10% chance and that's not high, so we thought it won't happen to us! WRONG. We have had 2 miscarriages in a year, so we see it as a double blessing.. Reply  Close d  dlh5 I'm currently 22 weeks with identical twins. No fertility drugs. Twins run in our family (sister has boy/girl fraternal twins) It's only fraternal twins that run in families (on mothers side) identical are a fluke as the egg splits.  Reply  Close 3  3stoogesmommy Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me here y'all! Even if clomid and a crazy dream brought me here! I'm actually a little confused on when I o'd I didn't get a confirmation. I had cramps and thought I had ovulated on Wednesday the 10th cd14, I also had a positive opk then. my Flo app says it would be on cd17 on the 13th when I O'd. We have been closely monitored up until this point and I'm feeling lost this cycle. Not sure exactly what dpo I am! i tested yesterday afternoon tho which my Flo app shows me way off showing as 8dpo as of yesterday anyways 8 got a very faint positive! So at either 11dpo or 8dpo lol let's pray no elephants are forming and just a sweet baby or babies ???? Reply  Close 3  3stoogesmommy I'm so lost this cycle cause I thought I was 8dpo 2 days ago lol .. I was doing much better wirh my doctor holding my hand through this!

I hope I don't offend anyone here, I know there's a slight increase in twins from clomid and while I'm accepting the risk by taking it, I would like to limit the chances just because I hear so many risks involved. So with that said I'm curious as to what days you took the clomid and what dose and if it ended up in twins or triplets. My doctor said it's personal preference to take it days 3-7 or 5-9. I've conceived using clomid before but can't for the life of me remember what days because it was 6 years ago!

Luckily I got pregnant ok my 6th round. On my 5th I had 4 follicles release. That would have been interesting. Reply  Close 0  06emjozwiak I researched the chances of conceiving multiples when I was on clomid. Like you I was willing to accept the risk of twins but I hoped to avoid it. It seemed like most sources agreed the chances of conceiving twins on clomid is 9% (general population has a 3% chance) and the chance of conceiving triplets is .1%. I never conceived on clomid because it never made me ovulate. I conceived with letrozole, metformin, provera, prometrium, ovidrel, and IUI (I have unexplained hormonal infertility and anovulation). The chances of twins were even smaller with letrozole than clomid, but I was aware that I had two follicles when I triggered. And I did have twins! Good luck! I wish you a long and healthy pregnancy - preferably with one baby lol! Reply  Close m  mland4905 I have not used clomid but my mom did and she had twins (me and my brother) she said she was on a very small dose, and this was in the 1980s. I will say though I don't know how much the clomid increases her odds for twins because there are ALOT of fraternal twins in her family and now I'm having fraternal twins(b/g). Reply  Close m  mrsreed9812 We got pregnant on our 3rd round of Clomid my last pregnancy and it ended up being only one baby. I can not remember what cycle days I took it. We are pregnant again now naturally and its twins! I just thought it was funny since our chances were higher with the Clomid than off of it. Good luck! :-) Reply  Close d  djb1786 I am pregnant from my third round of clomid days 5-9. I started on 50 mg and had a progesterone test day 21 of each month to determine my progesterone level. I did not ovulate on 50 or 100 mg of clomid, but am pregnant with twins from 150 mg. I am not sure clomid raised my odds or the fact that I have quite a few twins in my family. At my Dr. appointment this week she told me that if you aren't ovulating prior to taking clomid your chances of twins on clomid is 3%.

I was just curious how many of you got PG with multiples while being treated with clomid and then having an IUI....i am going in for my first IUI tomorrow and my brain is just thinking a lot!  Twins run in my family but the Dr's told me that doesn't "up" my odds of having them though an IUI. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  16 Posts m  myownlittlebean @Hoping4aBabyin2012  I took one round of low dose clomid and ended up with twins - no IUI.  The running in the family part only applies to fraternal twins on your mother's side... we have multiple sets of identical twins (mom's side) as well as a couple sets of fraternal (dad's side), but that didn't increase our odds.  The clomid just made me release more than one egg and they both were fertilized and here I am at almost 30 weeks pregnant excited to meet my little boy and girl :). Good luck! Obviously, you've had some difficulty getting pregnant, so I hope for your sake that you do get at least 2 for 1 :). I know we feel extra blessed and were thrilled to find out it was twins. I  IASoupMama @Hoping4aBabyin2012  Me!  That's why I have twin girls. Our fertility issues weren't me, though, so I was sort of anticipating that, since I was already ovulating, the Clomid would make me drop more than one egg.  I was right, LOL!  We were doing the IUI because DH's spermies were sleepies.  I'm pretty glad, actually, that the successful IUI only fertilized two eggs, because I don't know how many were available that month :) H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @myownlittlebean  Thank you so much!  I would love twins.  I have twin nephews and they are so much fun.  My fingers are crossed.  Congrats and Good luck to you!   What a blessing. H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @IASoupMama  Our fertility issues are also with DH and not myself.  His swimmers are immature (maybe the same as your DH's sleepys?)  Can I ask how many IUI's you had to do before your sucessful one? L  LisaRaw I took one round of clomid at the lowest dose & I now have 8 months old fraternal girls! I knew there was a small chance of it happening but thought "never to me!" Well here we are & I wouldn't change it for anything! :) J  JackieDowne @Hoping4aBabyin2012  Same with me. Took one round of the lowest dose and now i have almost 4 mo fraternal boys. We didn't find out it was twins until my 18 wk US we always only heard one heartbeat until then. Good luck! H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @JackieDowne  Did you have an IUI also? J  JackieDowne @Hoping4aBabyin2012  No I didn't have an IUI. I  IASoupMama @Hoping4aBabyin2012  We were successful on the second IUI, my third round of Clomid.  I actually conceived on the first round, but miscarried.  The second round wasn't timed well -- I thought my hormones were surging on the OPK, but was 2 days early.  The third round, the OPK was very clearly + (I now know it was because I was dropping multiple eggs, LOL!) and the IUI was perfect -- the nurse got the entire sample up there and there wasn't any "leakage." I don't know why DH's sperm quality took a nose dive -- we have a 6-year-old and an almost 4-year-old and were on month 18 of trying for #3 when I miscarried.  He made a crazy amount of sperm, but fewer than half of them had good motility. We were only going to do one more round of Clomid/IUI because I was deathly afraid of the next step -- injectable meds for me.  There's a MUCH higher chance of higher order multiples with the injectables and, given that I knew I was ovulating, I was beyond concerned that I would end up pregnant with quintuplets. I was also very glad that I did not need to take any more Clomid -- with each cycle I was feeling less and less like myself and more and more like a crazy hormonal wench.  My emotions were way out of control and I was miserable.  It was so much worse than any PMS or pregnancy mood swings and I felt terrible for having no patience with my kids or hubby. Good luck!! v  vwwife21 @LisaRaw  Just like you but our "small chance" turned into triplets. d  doulabliss My best friend just did her last IUI treatment and was going to do IVF but found out the IUI had worked and she is currently pregnant with triplets. H  Heather925 @Hoping4aBabyin2012  I'm pregnant for the second time, both times were from Clomid plus IUI. The first time was a singleton, and this time it's with twins. Good luck!!! Both were the first round too :) H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @Heather925  Thats awesome Heather!!!  Thank you so much for sharing!  And both first time IUI's- that gives me such hope!!  I would love it done on the first try...my first IUI was kind of a niightmare...I'm not looking fwd to doing a 2nd if it comes down to that. M  MamaKing2010 @Hoping4aBabyin2012  How many potential follicles do you have? I had to do injections + IUI (I dont respond to clomid) , had 2 follicles, and have b/g twins this time. Last time, I did Femara (no IUI), had 2 follicles, and had a singleton. H  Hoping4aBabyin2012 @MamaKing2010  I had 4 potential follicles...2 that were 14, a 17 and a 20.  Then there were 2 that were in the 12 range( maybe alittle smaller ) so they said they dont really could those....im hoping that some of the follicles had eggs!  fingers crossed!

They saw a doctor to find out what could be causing the problem and found out there wasn't any specific biological cause -- it was what's considered unexplained infertility. "It's hard, you're on an emotional roller coaster," Kilmartin told CBS News. She used the drug clomiphene, or Clomid, to stimulate egg production and increase her chances of pregnancy.  A new study shows the drug, which has become one of the standard treatments for unexplained infertility , may be the best  option for couples like the Kilmartins. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 900 couples who had trouble conceiving for at least a year despite normal reproductive function. The study tested the different medications that can increase chances for healthy pregnancy, looking for the greatest success of a live birth with the lowest chance of having multiples , one of the main risk factors for fertility drugs. Researchers were particularly interested in comparing two common drugs that promote extra egg release to a newer treatment using an aromatase inhibitor called letrozole, which has shown promising pregnancy rates without increased birth defects in other studies. The study was conducted at 12 clinics across the U.S. by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Women in the study were between 18 and 40 years old and had male partners with sperm counts healthy enough for artificial insemination. Though in-vitro fertilization is also an option for women having difficulty conceiving, it is much less common because it is expensive and most insurance doesn't cover the process; using a drug to promote ovary stimulation is the most common therapy. This study tested three ovary-stimulating drugs that increase the odds for pregnancy by releasing more eggs : clomiphene (Clomid) and letrazole pills, and an injectable hormone called gonadotropin. The two pills were blind tested against one another. The results? "Clomid was much more efficient than letrozole, achieving a live birth rate of 23 percent," Dr. Tomer Singer of Lenox Hill Human Reproduction told CBS News.  "The letrozole group only achieved 18 percent." The rate of becoming pregnant with multiples -- twins or triplets -- differed among the medications significantly.  The clomiphene group had the fewest multiple babies born per pregnancy, at 5.7 percent, compared to 14.3 percent in the letrozole group and 13.4 percent in the group receiving gonadotropins. "Letrozole treatment offered no advantages over clomiphene treatment," study author Esther Eisenberg, M.D., of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of the NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said in a statement. "Women in the letrozole treatment group had fewer live births, but four times as many multiple pregnancies as women in the clomiphene group." Injected gonadotropin treatments resulted in the highest number of births, 32 percent, but many were multiples -- twins or even triplets.  The group receiving gonadotropin had 24 twins and 10 triplets, whereas multiples born to women in the other drug groups were all twins. Pregnancies with multiple fetuses can involve more complications, often leading to substantially lower birth weights and pre-term births. "There's a higher rate of c-sections, more diabetes, more preeclampsia," Singer said. Limitations of the study could have affected the results slightly, including the fact that because gonadotropin is an injectable instead of a pill it could not be blindly studied against the other drugs.  Additionally, the study was designed to compare current treatments using either Clomid or gonadotropin as one result versus the newer letrazole instead of studying the three drugs separately.  Lastly, no control group was included because researchers felt it would be unethical to deny real treatment to couples who were seeking fertility help after trying to conceive for between one and three years. Nevertheless, study researchers believe that the evidence is strong that current standard therapy using clomiphene remains the most effect way to stimulate ovaries and increase healthy pregnancy odds for couples with unexplained infertility. After her treatment with Clomid, Kilmartin became pregnant with her son Lucas, who is now almost two years old. "I love children, I've always wanted to be a mother," Kilmartin said. "It seemed like forever to get there." Following another round of treatment, she is now expecting the couple's second child.   © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Thanks in advance Marnsxx Marns 24 DHTB- Russ 32 DS- Riley 6th July 2001 DS- Connor 7th April 2004 MC 01/10/04 5 wks 2 days http://tinyurl.com/3...nyurl.com/64h6p       Back to top                #2   crazymum2twins    Posted 09 December 2004 - 02:39 PM    I was on Clomid for nearly 2 years, never ovulated once. Ended up on 4 tablets a day (think that's 200mg). I then went on to Puregon injections, and within 3 months was pregnant with twins. Puregon is waaaay cheaper then Clomid too, especially if you need more then 1 packet a month. As far as I know, Clomid still tends to make 1 dominant follical, so the chance of a multiple birth isn't as high as being on Puregon, or doing IVF where more then 1 egg is put back. All I can say is good luck, I hope Clomid works for you, but to be honest don't hang around on the stuff for too long, move on to other forms of fertility drugs if it isn't working at all. Took me 4 1/2 years to get pregnant!

I was just taking one tablet a day for 5 days(50mg?) We tried 2 more cycles and nothing and on our last cycle, I only had one dominant follicle, but fell pregnant with our twins! We found out at 7 weeks we were having twins and we have some family history of fraternal twins so? Jackson and Hayden are now healthy gorgeous 10 month old boys! (Just a touch biased!) Hope that helps.. Let me know if I can help further Rhonda DH 37 Jackson 21/01/04 Hayden 21/01/04     Back to top                #4   twinmomma    Posted 09 December 2004 - 03:07 PM    That would be me!  We successfully conceived on a fairly low dose of Clomid, after about 5 cycles.  We sought help with secondary infertility after being unsuccessful for nearly 18 months TTC.  My specialist discovered I wasn't ovulating every cycle so my chances of conceiving were very slim, also my cycles varied in length so it was nearly impossible to predict when I might be ovulating.  I started out on 1/2 then moved on to 1 1/2 tabs and BINGO!!!!!....TWINS!

Im wanting to know also because I have done some reading and if you already ovulate normally- I did ovulate on my own between m/c and cycle of clomid- then it can potentially act like a higher dose of clomid anyway as your body is getting extra hormones from the clomid and some from your body fuinctioning normally- does this make sense? Ill have to keep reading I think!

I was on clomid 100mg .. I was a twin (twin died in utero), and paternal grandmother had twins .. lost in late second tri ... so the family history carried through me ...... 2 clomid babies due to polycystic ovaries and no twins. My friend was on 50mg clomid, no family history and bingo twins first and only clomid cycle .... OB thinks she O'd herself that cycle as well. So I do not think it really matters too much guess like any pregnancy just the luck of the draw!!

I recognise your name and the gorgeous photos of your children from the Clomidians TTC thread!  I am a graduate from the clomidians but pop in there now and then.  And yes, I conceived twins on clomid.  I also have a family history of twins so who knows which is the contributor, maybe both? I started on 50mg for my first 2 cycles but for some reason O'd on my first but not on my second so they upped me to 100mg for my third.  My levels for my third were what they consider to be low ie 17 as they apparently like you to be in the 20's or 30's for assisted conception.  So my gyno upped me to 150mg for my 4th cycle and whammo - twins!  Even though my BT showed only a level of 14.  Bissett in your thread also conceived with a level of 13 so I don't know why they insist on stressing everyone out with seeking higher levels? I am not sure if the higher dosage 150mg is what did it or the family history? but I know there is a slightly higher chance of multiple pg's on clomid. I hope this helps!

I did 3 rounds of Clomid and never got pregnant. We had our boys naturally after miscarriages and got pregnant with twins without fertility treatments. I had been looking forward to having just 1 baby for our 3rd because our boys are so close in age I wasn't able to enjoy them when they were tiny. I wasn't surprised that I was pregnant with twins for some reason, but a part of me was sad I was going to miss out on having just 1 baby to focus on. We're very excited though and having 2 so close in age, and so many twins mom's telling us they thing multiples are easier than having kids so close in age, I don't feel that twinge of sadness quite as much. It's always been funny to have twin mom's tell us we have our hands full I do think they're right though. I definitely wouldn't have TRIED for twins, but everyone is different and had different coping abilities. We see the benifits of having our boys so close, and were going to have #3 and #4 close as well because of it, so frankly I'm glad we're having twins, so I only have to go through 1 pregnancy and we can move on and enjoy life with older kids. The baby stage isn't my favorite.  Good luck!

And there are TONS of risks involved.  But to answer your question, I had 6 IUI's before my BFP.  The last two cycles I was on 100mg of Clomid and I took Ovidril.  My last cycle I released 3 eggs, and the Dr said that the chances of all three taking were pretty slim, but that I could very well conceive twins.  I ended up with triplets.  LOL  And while I've adjusted to the news now (as I was not too happy about the idea of triplets to begin with) and I'm excited to be having them, the pregnancy has been VERY uncomfortable.

Hi there ladies,  My DH and I are having problems conceiving our first child and my RE has put me on Clomid next cycle, starting on the weekend when my dreaded AF is due.  I'm starting on 50mg and my doctor has directed me to take the dose from days 2-6. I've read online that taking Clomid early in the cycle can increase the chances of multiples and I was just interested to know if what I have read online regarding this is accurate from a point of view of your experiences.  Also, did you find the side effects all that bad? I've read taking it at night is helpful in relieving some of the known side effects.  We are hoping we conceive soon so that I don't have to take the drug for too long.  Congratulations on your pregnancy/families and hopefully I'll be joining you in motherhood very soon with either one or more babies. God willing.  Best wishes to you all and thanks so much for reading my post.

(I'm thinking mine may be identical though which would mean it didn't have anything to do with it.)  I took it days 3-7.  I didn't have an U/S until 8 weeks and at that point they only found one cyst they were pretty sure was a CL.  I had a couple other cysts, but they didn't see the jagged edges they would expect from a CL.  The first cycle I didn't get it until CD4 for took it days 4-8, but didn't conceive.  I did get hot flashes from the Letrozole, but from what I'm told Letrozole is much more mild than Clomid and leaves your system quicker.

I don't think it ha much to do with what day you start but rather how many mature follicles you have. Maybe taking it earlier gives a chance for more follicles to grow? I'm not sure. As for side effects, I learned the hard way that it's best to take it at night. The first day I took it in the afternoon and had such bad hot flashes tht I literally stuck my head on the freezer as the a/c did nothing to help. After that, I still had the hot flashes but not nearly as bad because I slept through the worst of it. That is really the only side effect I remember. I know I had more but they weren't bad enough that I remember what they were.  Hopefully you get your BFP soon.

Thanks so much ladies for responding. I know it's not a forgone conclusion that I'll conceive with Clomid alone but I'm keep the faith that it will hopefully bring us one step closer to being parents.  My doctor has suggested that we time intercourse this month with an Ovidrel trigger once we know how many follicles we have. I've read that some people get super intense cramping with it when ovulating - did anybody experience this? I'm a big chicken!

Hello ladies! I found out today that I am expecting. And of course I am obsessing. I got pregnant while using clomid, 3 cycles to be exact. I had 2 follicles, and now I am wondering if my chances of having twins is now actually higher because I myself am a twin. I am also still breastfeeding, and I have heard that can make your chances higher. I have always wanted twins, because I love the bond that I have with my brother.  Am I thinking too much into this? Has anyone else taken clomid as a twin, and got pregnant with twins??

Identical twins are.  Fraternal twins are dizygomatic (come from two separate eggs and sperm, so they are not unlike any regular (non-twin) siblings.  :-)  Not sure on the Clomid or whatnot, but I don't believe the fact that you are a fraternal twin will effect the outcome of having twins yourself (I have never heard of double-ovulating to be a genetic quality).

He cannot make you ovulate more than one egg. Having said that, if you are a fraternal twin, then it must run in your mums side so therefore you have a chance. Also I know a lot of ladies on BnB that have taken clomid and went onnto have twins(some even triplets) so that could increase your chances too. Pop over to the twins and multiple section and have a chat with them if you like, the can tell you more. Good luck.

Identicals are just a fluke of nature when during cell separation in the early stage of pregnancy, the egg separates completely leaving two separate embryo's.  Non identical twins are caused by double ovulation which Is a genetic thing running down the female side of the family.  To the op - as you were on clomid I guess you'll never know if the two follicles were due to genetics and your twin history of as a result of the clomid.  Your husbands side of the family have no affect on this. Also you won't know if it's a singleton or twin pregnancy until you're scanned.

Is there anyone who has been on 50 mg of clomid and gotten pregnant the with twins? How many rounds does clomid take usually? I'm about to go on my first round, hoping for one but will be thankful for what ever I get....I'm a little nervous.

You are only likely to get multiples if the clomid causes you to create and release more Han one follicle.  Are you being monitored with u/s? If so they will be able to tell you if you prepare and release multiple eggs.  Obliviously the one egg could split and create identical twins but that is not any more of a risk than in the normal population.

I am currently on day 7 of provera to jump start AF again. She has stayed away since 2007. I'm suppose to take provera for 10 days and have a visit fr AF 5 days later, cross my fingers. Then, I will start clomid days 5-9 of my cycle. I won't be having ultra sounds this month, which is why I'm nervous. Doc says he will up me to 100 mg and Ultra sounds next month if I don't get a BFP this month.

That still gives you a 90 - 92% chance of NOT having multiples.  I am not a betting person but given those differences in odds you are probably safe to only have 1 if you get a BFP but you have to be ok with twins when you move to fertility drugs              Status: Offline                               Apr 28th, 2011, 13:43 PM   5       MrandMrs    Trying to conceive (TTC)  Active BnB Member    Join Date: Apr 2011  Posts: 26        I am very willing to take whatever I am blessed with.

Im rooting for you and hoping you get your BFP soon!!  MrandMrs, good luck with your first round of clomid! I am waiting (impatiently) to see the FS June 3rd where I will be prescribed Clomid (or so I am told) I just finished 10 days of provera and going to be doing CD22 bloodwork and hubby is doing SA next weekend.  I am actually a twin myself (my mom concieved twins naturally and her sister, my aunt, had twins also!) I wonder if me being a twin and taking clomid increases my chances of multiples? hmm... Id be okay with one or two. three or more is a little scary though ;-)                  Status: Offline                   May 8th, 2011, 22:29 PM   9       Mrs. Bear    Pregnant (Expecting)  BnB Addict        Join Date: Nov 2010  Location: USA  Posts: 3,217        My sister had twin girls her first round of 50mg clomid - that is the exception not the rule though.

I started on 50 mg of Clomid last summer (cd 5-9), after a couple cycles they upped it to 100 mg and I got pregnant in November, which ended in an early chemical pregnancy loss.  Bumped me back to 50 mg, and here I am the very next cycle, preggo with twins couldn't be happier.  I have a set of fraternal twin second or third cousins, but that's IT on either side.

I just picked up my 2 times a day for 50mg each clomid and I have read so many non success stories and I came across this site where I read success stories so I had to comment.  I really hope this works for us, I will not be trying IUI or IFV if this doesn't work I just feel it just is not meant to be but I am hopeful.
