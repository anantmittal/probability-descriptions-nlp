Hence the odds are one in seven.  Please take the time to pick a Best answer.

Odds of 2 to 1 against means probability is 1/3  (1 in 3) Odds of 2 to 1 for means probability is 2/3 (2 in 3) So you need to reword your questions to make this clear.  Nobody is going to answer all 35 questions.  Here are a few only.  Q3: Probability of picking a spade in a standard 52-card pack is 13/52 or 1/4. This means the odds against are 3 to 1.  So the given answer is false.  Q4 Probability if picking an 'a' from 'georgia' is 1/7 Odds against are 6 to 1.  Q7 Probability of picking a '5' from a card pack is 4/52  (since there are four 'fives') This is 1/13 Odds against are 12 to 1  Q8 Probability is zero, since there is no '7' on a standard six-sided die.  You will have to do the rest yourself.  But do NOT confuse probability with odds!

Underdogs have covered all three title games since the playoff began and won outright in 2015 and 2017, generating massive payouts for their backers. When Clemson upset Alabama 35-31 last year, William Hill sportsbooks posted a seven-figure loss that director Nick Bogdanovich called "a burial." Nevada sportsbooks as a whole took nearly $20 million in wagers on that game, the bulk of it on the Tigers. Many books called it their worst college football game ever. Bettors pounded Clemson on the money line, which was around +180. So they received $180 for every $100 wagered. Underdog money-line players also cashed big in 2015, with Ohio State paying off at +170. If you had bet $100 on every CFP title game underdog -- both against the spread and money line -- you would be up $550. Will Georgia , a four-point dog to Alabama, extend the trend Monday? From early indications, most bettors don't think so.    The Tide have drawn 67 percent of the bets and 80 percent of the money at William Hill's 100-plus Nevada sportsbooks. On the money line, Alabama has drawn 91 percent of the dollars wagered, though Georgia has attracted 63 percent of the tickets. Monday night's over-under has fallen two points to 45 at William Hill. A spokesman said 84 percent of the money is on the under, but with Alabama involved the past two years, the CFP title game went over with ease.

No.1 Clemson will take on No. 4 Alabama -- the clear No. 4 team in the country as a nonconference champion, according to selection committee chair Kirby Hocutt -- in the Sugar Bowl. No. 2 Oklahoma will face No. 3 Georgia in the Rose Bowl. Now that we know which teams are playing and where, it's time to set the early odds on who will win. According to SportsLine's Stephen Oh, Alabama has a 65 percent chance of beating Clemson by a projected score of 23-19. Meanwhile, Georgia has a mere 51 percent chance of beating Oklahoma by a projected score of 28-27. Alabama is then given a 70 percent chance to beat Georgia by a projected score of 23-17.    Overall, Sportsline gives the Tide a 46 percent chance of winning the playoff with the Bulldogs coming in with a 20 percent chance. Clemson and Oklahoma are given a 17 percent chance. However, the Tide and Sooners are one-point and three-point favorites, respectively, according to the WestGate superbook. Remember, this marks the first time in the playoff era that two teams from the same conference were chosen among the final four.  Opening lines @WestgateVegas  Alabama (-1) vs. Clemson Oklahoma (-3) vs. Georgia ‚Äî Chris Fallica (@chrisfallica) December 3, 2017   Sportsline projected earlier that Alabama would be a three-point favorite over Ohio State , the No. 5 team left out of the playoff, if the two were to meet on a neutral field.

The winner gets ultimate bragging rights, an SEC title and a ticket punched to the College Football Playoff. Georgia is fresh off a throttling of Georgia Tech in Atlanta 38-7 at Bobby Dodd Stadium, while Auburn handled Alabama 26-14 in Jordan-Hare Stadium last week to take the SEC West crown. SportsLine The latest advice on the SEC Championship Game The Tigers are 2.5-point favorites over the Bulldogs in the SEC on CBS Game of the Week. Viewing information Date : Saturday, Dec. 2 | Time : 4 p.m. ET Location : Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, Georgia TV : CBS¬†| Live stream : CBSSports.com , CBS Sports App    Storylines Georgia: The Bulldogs got exposed a bit by Auburn the last time out, when the offensive line struggle to protect quarterback Jake Fromm , and running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel were constantly forced to change direction in the backfield. If they're going to have a chance this go-round, the offensive line will have to be better and coordinator Jim Chaney will have to mix in more screens, draws and other plays that neutralize Auburn's strength -- the defensive line. In November when the two met, Auburn forced Georgia out of its comfort zone, and the Bulldogs had no answer. They have to prevent that from happening in the rematch. Auburn: For the Tigers, it's all about the healthy of running back Kerryon Johnson . The star junior left the win over Alabama with a shoulder injury, and has been the foundation of the Tiger offense throughout the season. With Kamryn Pettway also out, the last thing Auburn needs is an inexperienced back like Kam Martin shouldering the load. Nothing against Martin, but Auburn is elite when it has the proven force between the tackles and outside. If Johnson as at, or close, to 100 percent, Auburn can run away again. If not, it's going to be a fist fight. Prediction Before the season, I picked Georgia over Auburn in the SEC Championship Game with a College Football Playoff berth on the line. Today, I'm sticking to that pick. While I think Johnson is good enough during the week, a few hits from linebackers Roquan Smith and Lorenzo Carter might change that. Tigers coach Gus Malzahn will try to protect Johnson, the offense won't be as fluid and it will allow Georgia to hang around. If you allow Georgia to hang around, Chubb and Michel will take over. The Bulldogs will spring the upset with a statement drive in the fourth quarter that results in the game-winning field goal to send them to the CFP.

For the Bulldogs and their fans, this is an opportunity decades in the making. Georgia has not played for a national title since 1983 nor brought home the championship since 1980. The Crimson Tide, meanwhile, will be playing in their third straight title game and sixth over thel last nine seasons. Alabama is 4-1 in its previous five such games and defeated LSU 21-0 in that prior all-SEC meeting to win the 2011 title. Alabama coach Nick Saban and Georgia coach Kirby Smart have their history, as do their respective staffs. Will Saban move to 12-0 all-time against his former assistants, or will Smart's youth and guile give him an edge over his former boss? Here's what our panel of CBS Sports college football experts think will happen on Monday night.      Dennis Dodd       Jerry Palm       Barton Simmons       Chip Patterson       Tom Fornelli       Ben Kercheval       Barrett Sallee       Adam Silverstein       Brandon Wise  BAMA -4      Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Georgia       Alabama       Georgia  SU      Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Alabama       Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Alabama       Georgia  So what side do you need to be all over in the National Championship Game? Visit SportsLine now to get a strong pick for Alabama vs. Georgia from SEC football guru Barrett Sallee , who's on a red-hot 27-18 run in against the spread picks.    2018 College Football Playoff predictions Dennis Dodd, senior college football insider: Alabama's defense is "fixed." Not that it was ever broken, but this unit simply wasn't up to Nick Saban's own standards this season. But going from giving up 35 to Clemson a year ago to six last Monday sends an encouraging message. Sony Michel and Nick Chubb aren't going to have free run of the field like they did against Oklahoma. Despite losing linebacker Anfernee Jennings, the D is dialed in. Alabama 21, Georgia 17 Barton Simmons, senior college football writer: We're all programmed to overthink this game, dig into the details of every matchup, every strength, every weakness. But this matchup in particular is two evenly matched teams with two very similar identities on both offense and defense who do it with personnel that is pretty even. So in a game like this, it boils down to execution, and I just trust Georgia to execute better. The game will be close, and it may just be a matter of two mistake-averse teams waiting the other out to see who blinks first. I trust Jake Fromm and Georgia slightly more to win that staring contest. While Georgia played in the closer, more emotional contest in the semifinals, Alabama played in the more physical game that cost it two starters. With razor thin margins, that will be enough for a three point win. Georgia 20, Alabama 17 Jerry Palm, CFP & bowls expert: Alabama has the best talent and the best coach. That is really all the reason you need to pick the Crimson Tide to win this game or any game. Obviously, Alabama does not win them all, but the Tide's problem this year has been more health than anything. The team is as healthy and motivated as it has been all year and has been in this situation before. Also, I don't know what it is about coaching against his former assistants, but Nick Saban is 11-0 in those games.¬† Make no mistake: Georgia is good enough to win this game, but I'm not going to bet on it. Alabama 20, Georgia 13 Chip Patterson, college football writer:  This just feels like a game that both teams are more than happy to play in a phone booth, and when it comes to strength-on-strength with a national championship on the line, the logical pick is Alabama. It would not surprise me if Georgia, in the midst of a wild year that will certainly spark more SEC championship and College Football Playoff runs in the future, pulls off the upset, but it will take a few turnovers and big special teams plays to get it done. The issues that Oklahoma had with alignments, run fits and open field tackling aren't going to be there for the Tide, so I just don't think that Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will be able to spring enough explosive runs to sustain drives against an Alabama defense that was in full boa constrictor mode against Clemson. Alabama 23, Georgia 16    Tom Fornelli, college football writer: I can't go against Alabama here. Yes, these two teams are similar, and both are very good. Georgia could win just as easily as Alabama, but I'm not going to pick the Dawgs to do it. The reason is simple: While they're near mirror images of one another, Alabama is better in the areas where it's better than Georgia than Georgia is in the spots it's better than Bama. Also, after watching last week's game, I fear that Alabama's defense is back in Death Machine mode, and God help anybody that gets in the way of Alabama's Death Machine. Alabama 27, Georgia 21 Barrett Sallee, college football writer: It comes down to one simple thing: Georgia is a more complete football team than Alabama. They prefer to get down and dirty and play the physical style Alabama is known for playing, but can also open it up when they need to -- as they showed in the Rose Bowl when quarterback Jake Fromm led them down to tie the game at the end of regulation. Georgia will pick and choose its time to open things up, hit a few big plays and control the game throughout. Keep an eye on D'Andre Swift and Sony Michel as receivers out of the backfield. They could be big parts of the game plan as weapons during when coach Kirby Smart decides to get creative. Georgia 24, Alabama 17 Ben Kercheval, college football writer: Considering how dominant Alabama and Georgia's respective defensive fronts were in the semifinals, it should be no surprise this projects as a lower-scoring game. The difference is Georgia's smashmouth offense, while efficient, plays right into Alabama's strength on defense. If the Sugar Bowl taught us anything, it's that the Crimson Tide's death by slow suffocation is back and brutally effective as ever. Georgia won the Rose Bowl in a style that was out of its comfort zone. It doesn't feel like this is the type of game (or opponent) in which it can afford to do that again. Alabama 24, Georgia 20 Adam Silverstein, assistant managing editor: Experience counts -- not just on the field and on the sidelines but in the postseason. Add that to Georgia's extensive travel -- not just from California back to Georgia but between Athens and Atlanta constantly in preparation for the game -- and the Crimson Tide seem to have every off-the-field edge. And in a game featuring familiar coaches and defenses, those added advantages count. Add to that Jalen Hurts' mobility as an X-factor, and the fact that Alabama specializes in shutting down Georgia's strength (it's tremendous run game), and I think the curse of the favorites at recent championship games (0-4 ATS, 2-2 SU) comes to an end Monday. Alabama 27, Georgia 20    Brandon Wise, college football editor: Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will do something no other rushing duo in the country has accomplished: crack Alabama's vaunted front seven. With a little help from freshman Jake Fromm and a powerful offensive line, Chubb and Michel will methodically break the defense down and score multiple times to bring the Bulldogs a title.

Georgia. Crimson Tide. Bulldogs. Where I come from, a crimson tide means to stay out of the water. (You probably shouldn‚Äôt eat anything from the water either, but that‚Äôs never been a concern of mine given my laundry list of food allergies.)  Enough about me: The College Football Playoff National Championship is here! (And boy is it a mouthful.) Bama is back (shocker) and will face off against Georgia, who could be had at 50-1 over the summer. Nick Saban‚Äôs squad is looking to totally redeem itself after being upset last year as a 6.5-point favorite at the hands of Deshaun Watson and Clemson.  This year, oddsmakers believe it will be an even closer game. Let‚Äôs take a look at what the experts have to say. ‚Äì Mark Gallant  All info is as of Monday afternoon. For live spreads and bet percentages, check out this page . To get access to our premium tools, subscribe here .     The setup: Alabama (-3.5) vs. Georgia ¬†|¬† O/U: 45.5  Betting market: Alabama opened as 5.5-point favorites at 5Dimes; the line was then released across the market with the Tide as 4.5-point favorites. It appears the early bets from sharp bettors took Georgia and the under. Our Bet Signals data triggered Steam Moves on Georgia (+4) and the under (45). The consensus line moved from -3.5 to -4 early Monday afternoon, behind Alabama getting the majority of the overall tickets, but Georgia got steamed by some sharp money shortly thereafter, moving it back to +3.5. Alabama (64% of tickets) is the most popular National Championship bet since we started tracking data in 2005. ‚Äî PJ Walsh and Mark Gallant    Metrics overview: These teams are almost identical on both sides of the ball. Bama gains 6.7 yards per play on offense. Georgia: 6.9. Alabama allows 3.9 ypp on defense. Georgia: 4.6. Both offensive lines struggle in pass protection and thrive when run-blocking. ‚Äî Stuckey  The coaches: One reason these schools are so similar statistically? Their head coaches are cut from the same cloth. Georgia head coach Kirby Smart served as the defensive backs coach at LSU under Nick Saban in 2004. In 2006, Smart rejoined Saban with the Miami Dolphins before eventually serving multiple years as Alabama‚Äôs defensive coordinator. But wait, it goes deeper. Jeremy Pruitt, Smart‚Äôs replacement at Alabama, came from Georgia while Bulldogs defensive coordinator Mel Tucker worked as a DB coach under Saban at Alabama. The intense overlap between the two programs, both statistically and schematically, is what makes this game so difficult to handicap. ‚Äî Collin Wilson  A few coaching trends: Nick Saban is the sixth-most profitable coach in our database when listed as a favorite against a conference opponent: 49-39 ATS, a +$808 profit for a $100 bettor.  Saban is also 11-0 SU and 9-2 ATS when facing one of his former Alabama assistants, winning by an average of 28.7 PPG and covering the spread by 11.7 PPG. Seven of the 11 games were played away from Tuscaloosa; Saban outscored his assistants 293-71 (31.7 PPG differential) in those contests. One thing to consider, though: The average spread in those 11 games was -17, and Monday‚Äôs game will mark just the second time Saban faces a more assistant as less than a TD favorite. ‚Äî John Ewing and Evan Abrams  Did you know? Underdogs have covered in the past four national championship games. Since 2009, only three favorites have covered the spread in the national title: All three teams were coached by Saban (2009, 2011, 2012). ‚Äî Evan Abrams     When Alabama has the ball  What the metrics say: Alabama‚Äôs bread and butter on offense is the run-pass option (RPO). QB Jalen Hurts has masked his inability to throw downfield for two seasons thanks to great decision making when running RPOs. But Georgia‚Äôs front seven, led by freakish LB Roquan Smith, has shut down similar RPO-reliant QBs this season.  The average Passing Success Rate for a QB is 40%. Here‚Äôs what a few RPO QBs did vs. the Dawgs this season:   Brandon Wimbush, Notre Dame: 21% Passing Success Rate  Nick Fitzgerald, Mississippi State: 27%  Jarrett Stidham, Auburn: 31%  Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma: 37% ‚Äî Collin Wilson   DFS prospect to watch: WR Calvin Ridley. Ridley is widely expected to be a first-round pick, but he looks unlike a lot of successful Day 1 selections from previous seasons . Often compared to Amari Cooper, Ridley turned 21 as a true freshman: When Cooper was 21, he was in the NFL. When his advanced age is taken into account, Ridley‚Äôs 1,045-yard freshman season isn‚Äôt impressive and he‚Äôs regressed since then. Last year he had just 769 yards and this year he has just 16 percent of Alabama‚Äôs receiving touchdowns. With his smallish size (6‚Äô1‚Ä≥ and 190 pounds), Ridley will need to display good athleticism in his pre-draft workouts to justify his draft hype. ‚Äî Matthew Freedman     When Georgia has the ball  What the metrics say: Alabama boasts the nation‚Äôs No. 2 S&P+ Rush Defense , which will be critical against Georgia‚Äôs No. 8 ranked S&P+ Rush Offense . A deeper dive into the ground game matchup reveals that Alabama‚Äôs defense ranks in the top 15 in opportunity rate and adjusted line yards . Surprise surprise: Georgia‚Äôs offense also ranks in the top 15 of those two categories .  One advantage to keep an eye on: Georgia‚Äôs offense ranks 24th in Power Success Rate, defined as the percentage of runs that result in a first down on third-and-short and fourth-and-short. Alabama‚Äôs defense comes in at 119th overall.  Should this game be close late, watch out for Bama‚Äôs fourth-quarter defense, which ranks third in S&P+. ‚Äî Collin Wilson and Stuckey  Prop I‚Äôm eyeing: Jake Fromm over 15.5 completions. This is a tight line if you look at Fromm‚Äôs game log of completions. But Georgia has thrown more on first down in their past two games, and if Smart continues that trend to get Fromm some confidence, you‚Äôll see this sail over the total. ‚Äî Collin Wilson  Injury watch: Alabama‚Äôs injuries at linebacker didn‚Äôt hurt them against a Clemson offense that struggles to produce explosive plays. But with Georgia‚Äôs rushing attack adept at breaking the game open, the losses of Anfernee Jennings (out), Shaun Dion (doubtful), and Dylan Moses (out) could loom large for Bama‚Äôs D. ‚Äî Stuckey  DFS prospects to watch: RBs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel. As a freshman, Chubb looked like a future first-rounder in relief of lead back Todd Gurley, but then he tore multiple ligaments in his knee as a sophomore and was capably replaced by Michel. Chubb returned to action as a junior and since then, he and Michel have formed one of the most dynamic backfield duos in the history of college football. Last game they broke the all-time teammate rushing record held by Eric Dickerson and Craig James (8,192 career rushing yards). They now have 67 more yards than the Pony Express ‚Äî with 249 fewer carries . Both Chubb and Michel are Day 2 prospects with Day 1 potential. ‚Äî Matthew Freedman  Prop I‚Äôm eyeing:¬†D‚ÄôAndre Swift to score first TD +3500. This line is from 5Dimes and is a good reminder of why you should shop around for the best number with this stuff (it‚Äôs +1200 on BetOnline, for example). Swift had 88 yards and a TD on seven carries in the SEC title game, but he was barely used in the Rose Bowl. I can see him getting touches to provide a different look tonight. He has the ability to break a full-field TD from anywhere. ‚Äî Collin Wilson     A word about special teams  Georgia gets the nod here, as the Bulldogs lead the nation in Special Teams S&P+. Specifically, Georgia ranks fourth nationally in kickoff success rate while Alabama is only No. 105 in kickoff return success rate. Translation: You can expect Alabama‚Äôs starting field position to be at the 20 or less. Georgia‚Äôs field position off kickoffs has the potential to be much better, with Alabama‚Äôs JK Scott forcing a touchback just 47% of the time. The Dawgs should also benefit from placekicker Rodrigo Blankenship, who has been a little shaky from 40-49 yards (4-of-7), but has connected on a few key bombs this season, most notably a 55-yarder in the Rose Bowl. Alabama‚Äôs kicker, Andy Pappanastos, has gone just 4-of-8 on field goals of 40-49 yards this season, and Saban has yet to trust him with a kick of 50-plus. With the game expected to be heavy on defense and field position, Georgia‚Äôs advantage in the kicking game should not be overlooked. ‚Äî Collin Wilson     Which way are you leaning?  We both played Georgia and the under on the open and would still recommend both at anything +3.5 or higher and 44.5 and up (as always, shop for the best number). The first-half under is also worth a look. Listen, the margin in this game is razor thin. This is not a game we‚Äôd advise betting more on just because there‚Äôs a title up for grabs. These teams could not be more similar and the game will ultimately come down to the little things. One example is red zone efficiency. The Bulldogs score on 95.7 percent of their drives inside the 20 (fifth in the country) compared to 88.1 percent for Alabama (36th in the country). Those tiny advantages inside the red zone, on special teams and in high-leverage short-yardage situations add up over the course of the game and could ultimately swing the matchup in Georgia‚Äôs favor. ‚Äî Collin Wilson and Stuckey  Images for photo illustration via USA TODAY Sports   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit  Email           Related Posts           Where Will Alabama‚Äôs Nick Saban End Up in 2018?

Georgia-Auburn could be the most interesting and competitive SEC football game in the 2017 regular season. A trio of Week 11 matchups feature top 10 team vs. top 10 team, and this is the most intriguing.          College football betting picks, Georgia-Auburn  Georgia (9-0) was an underdog just twice all season ‚Äî at Notre Dame, and for just a few minutes at a single offshore book Sunday when Auburn opened as a 2-point favorite. UGA faces its biggest remaining threat to an unbeaten season. Auburn (7-2) can keep alive SEC Championship hopes by ending a 3-game losing streak in the Deep South‚Äôs Oldest Rivalry.  Auburn welcomed transfer QB Jarrett Stidham from Baylor and hired offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey to win precisely this type of game. And Georgia has been preparing freshman Jake Fromm, knowing there would be a game the Bulldogs couldn‚Äôt win solely with its running backs. Both teams play excellent defense, and both hope to usurp the Alabama Crimson Tide as the SEC‚Äôs alpha program.  I can‚Äôt wait for this game. Finally, an SEC on CBS matchup worthy of that designation.  MyBookie line (Nov. 9) : Georgia -2.5  MyBookie total (Nov. 9) : 47  How Georgia can win: Stuff the middle with Trenton Thompson, Roquan Smith and others, forcing the game into the hands of Jarrett Stidham. Shred Auburn‚Äôs offensive tackles like Clemson and LSU did earlier this season. Get a lead, run the ball effectively on offense and avoid making Jake Fromm conduct game-winning drives against an elite defense in front of a raucous road crowd.  How Auburn can win: Be aggressive. That means throwing downfield to Darius Slayton, Will Hastings and Nate Craig-Myers. And avoiding a complete breakdown of pass protection in the process. Auburn‚Äôs defense still ranks among the top 10 nationally in many categories, but has shown some cracks in recent weeks. The Tigers need to stymie UGA‚Äôs excellent running game, force Jake Fromm to determine the outcome of the game and hope to expose the still-inexperienced QB.          Here are a few additional nuggets:   Undefeated teams are 20-39-1 against the spread in November and December during the College Football Playoff era. That‚Äôs a bad trend for Georgia.  Top 10 teams that are home underdogs, a rare combination, are 12-25 straight up and 18-18-1 against the spread. That‚Äôs a bad trend for Auburn.  Georgia has won 9 of the last 11 in this series. Both of Auburn‚Äôs wins came at home, including the 2013 ‚ÄúPrayer at Jordan-Hare‚Äù and a 2010 duel between Cam Newton and Aaron Murray.   GEORGIA BULLDOGS  ATS : 6-3, +89  Over/Under : 3/6  Average line : -15  Average betting total : 49.6  Georgia started the season 5-0 against the spread vs. FBS teams, and reached a remarkable +104.5 at one point against the spread, excluding the Samford game. But it‚Äôs possible that the market has finally corrected itself. Maybe even over-corrected. UGA is 1-2 against the number since Oct. 7, with the lone win coming against Florida as the Gators were preparing to fire Jim McElwain the next day.  The ‚Äúover‚Äù also has hit in 3 of Georgia‚Äôs last 4 games.  F+/- combined ratings : No. 1  Offensive points per possession : No. 13  Defensive points per possession : No. 4  SOS : No. 29  According to every credible analytics number, Auburn is the second-best team that Georgia has faced all season, behind Notre Dame. Let‚Äôs use F+/-, which I view as the best college football analytics ranking. Georgia beat No. 2 Notre Dame on the road by 1 point and crushed No. 15 Mississippi State at home by 28. But both those teams are run-centric to an extreme, including at quarterback.          The next-best team that UGA has beaten? No. 58 South Carolina. Auburn is the first very good team Georgia has faced that possesses a legitimate pass offense.  Injuries   LB Natrez Patrick (marijuana-related suspension) is expected to play against Auburn after a 4-game absence. A starter before his suspension, Kirby Smart wouldn‚Äôt say whether Patrick would get his spot back right away.  DB Rashad Roundtree (concussion) has missed the entire season.  OL Pat Allen (leg) and DT DaQuan Hawkins-Muckle (back) are listed as questionable on a few injury websites.   Schedule Spot  After destroying Florida, 42-7, Georgia played a closer-than-expected game against South Carolina last week, clinching the SEC East. Kentucky is next, but this is the toughest game left for UGA in the regular season. Expect this team‚Äôs best effort.  Coaching/QBs     Coach  Year  Overall  SEC  Accolades    Kirby Smart  2nd  17-5  10-4  None as head coach     Smart has turned this UGA program into a juggernaut. He‚Äôs recruiting as well as any SEC program. The defense is elite. The running game is as good as any team‚Äôs in the country. And the team is passing effectively as well. In other words, Georgia is balanced. And in position to contend for championships for years to come.             Player  TDs  INTs  YPA  Comp. %    Jake Fromm  15  4  9.7  63.3%     Fromm has thrown more than 15 passes in just 3 games, but that includes 2 of the last 3. He‚Äôll make it 3 of 4 this week, as Georgia won‚Äôt be able to win this game by running the ball 50+ times. He‚Äôs also thrown for more than 201 yards just once. But he‚Äôs been scary efficient, and when he does throw, it‚Äôs usually for big yardage. He‚Äôs been very accurate downfield.  A big effort from Fromm in this game will eliminate any doubters and cement this team as a national championship contender. But it‚Äôs Auburn‚Äôs job to make Fromm win the game rather than manage it.  AUBURN TIGERS  ATS : 3-5-1, +26  Over/Under : 6/3  Average line : -17.1  Average betting total : 53.6  Auburn‚Äôs games have gone ‚Äúover‚Äù the betting total 6 consecutive times. Auburn has scored 51, 49, 44, 52 and 42 points against SEC opponents in 5 of those 6 games. In the sixth, Auburn scored 23 first-half points at LSU and then didn‚Äôt score in the second half. So, excluding a single half ‚Äî in which Auburn‚Äôs offense went into a conservative shell ‚Äî the Tigers are averaging 47.5 points per game against SEC teams.  F+/- combined ratings : No. 11  Offensive points per possession : No. 24  Defensive points per possession : No. 11  SOS : No. 15  Just 7 FBS teams rank in the top 25 in both offensive and defensive points per possession (adjusted to remove points scored on defense and special teams): Alabama, Georgia, Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Washington, UCF ‚Ä¶ and Auburn.          And although the team‚Äôs offense has been explosive during SEC play, the defense has performed even better ‚Äî holding Clemson to 14 points, Missouri to 14 points and Mississippi State to 10 points.  Injuries   The health of Auburn‚Äôs offensive line remained the biggest question mark as of Friday. Tackle Darius James and left guard Mike Horton played last week but left the game vs. Texas A&M due to lingering ankle injuries. Casey Dunn also has been dealing with a lingering injury. It‚Äôs unclear who will start at what positions , though Gus Malzahn said everyone should be available.  Oft-injured RB Kamryn Pettway (shoulder) could be out the rest of the season.   Schedule Spot  Auburn beat Texas A&M comfortably last week off a bye, and gets Louisiana-Monroe next week. The Iron Bowl looms on the horizon, but the Tigers need this one badly.  Win out, and Auburn could sneak into the College Football Playoff. Lose to UGA and Bama and coach Gus Malzahn could be fired. That‚Äôs the type of range at stake. Expect a focused effort.  Coaching/QBs     Coach  Year  Overall  SEC  Accolades    Gus Malzahn  5th  42-20  23-15  SEC Coach of the Year in 2013; SEC Championship in 2013     Malzahn‚Äôs two worst traits as a head coach, at least this year: 1) He gets too conservative after halftime leads and 2) He tries to prove he‚Äôs the smartest guy in the stadium and sometimes gets too cute. It cost Auburn the game against LSU ‚Äî otherwise this team is 8-1 right now.  Auburn isn‚Äôt going to get a three-score lead against Georgia on Saturday. So we should get Aggressive Auburn for 60 minutes. And Aggressive Auburn is very, very good.  If Malzahn loses this one, though, his job is very much in jeopardy.     Player  TDs  INTs  YPA  Comp. %    Jarrett Stidham  11  3  9.1  66.8%     The hype around Stidham before the season probably was unfair. His offensive tackles aren‚Äôt very good at protecting him. His receivers haven‚Äôt been as good as their star ratings suggested they should be. But Stidham is very good when he gets a clean pocket. He‚Äôs as accurate as any quarterback in the SEC in those situations. And Georgia‚Äôs secondary should give him some opportunities to make plays downfield.  THE WIZARD‚ÄôS PREDICTION  Bet: Auburn +2.5.  Score: Auburn 27, Georgia 24  I‚Äôve felt that Auburn has been underrated by the market, the media and the general public almost all season. And thanks to some terrible coaching in the second half in Baton Rouge, this team remains a clear and distant third in most folks‚Äô SEC power rankings.  The Tigers could very well finish 8-4 ‚Äî with losses to as many as 3 College Football Playoff teams.  Yes, Georgia beat Notre Dame and Mississippi State. But this is the best, most balanced SEC team UGA will face all season, at least until a potential SEC Championship Game matchup with Alabama.  I think the markets are overvaluing Georgia right now because of the 0 in the loss column. (See: Last week, when Georgia didn‚Äôt come close to covering as a 24-point favorite against South Carolina.)  I also like the ‚Äúover‚Äù in this matchup, which has hit in 6 consecutive Auburn games and in 3 of Georgia‚Äôs last 4 games, as noted above.

Odds of 2 to 1 against means probability is 1/3  (1 in 3) Odds of 2 to 1 for means probability is 2/3 (2 in 3) So you need to reword your questions to make this clear.  Nobody is going to answer all 35 questions.  Here are a few only.  Q3: Probability of picking a spade in a standard 52-card pack is 13/52 or 1/4. This means the odds against are 3 to 1.  So the given answer is false.  Q4 Probability if picking an 'a' from 'georgia' is 1/7 Odds against are 6 to 1.  Q7 Probability of picking a '5' from a card pack is 4/52  (since there are four 'fives') This is 1/13 Odds against are 12 to 1  Q8 Probability is zero, since there is no '7' on a standard six-sided die.  You will have to do the rest yourself.  But do NOT confuse probability with odds!

Underdogs have covered all three title games since the playoff began and won outright in 2015 and 2017, generating massive payouts for their backers. When Clemson upset Alabama 35-31 last year, William Hill sportsbooks posted a seven-figure loss that director Nick Bogdanovich called "a burial." Nevada sportsbooks as a whole took nearly $20 million in wagers on that game, the bulk of it on the Tigers. Many books called it their worst college football game ever. Bettors pounded Clemson on the money line, which was around +180. So they received $180 for every $100 wagered. Underdog money-line players also cashed big in 2015, with Ohio State paying off at +170. If you had bet $100 on every CFP title game underdog -- both against the spread and money line -- you would be up $550. Will Georgia , a four-point dog to Alabama, extend the trend Monday? From early indications, most bettors don't think so.    The Tide have drawn 67 percent of the bets and 80 percent of the money at William Hill's 100-plus Nevada sportsbooks. On the money line, Alabama has drawn 91 percent of the dollars wagered, though Georgia has attracted 63 percent of the tickets. Monday night's over-under has fallen two points to 45 at William Hill. A spokesman said 84 percent of the money is on the under, but with Alabama involved the past two years, the CFP title game went over with ease. So what side do you need to be all over in the national championship game?

No.1 Clemson will take on No. 4 Alabama -- the clear No. 4 team in the country as a nonconference champion, according to selection committee chair Kirby Hocutt -- in the Sugar Bowl. No. 2 Oklahoma will face No. 3 Georgia in the Rose Bowl. Now that we know which teams are playing and where, it's time to set the early odds on who will win. According to SportsLine's Stephen Oh, Alabama has a 65 percent chance of beating Clemson by a projected score of 23-19. Meanwhile, Georgia has a mere 51 percent chance of beating Oklahoma by a projected score of 28-27. Alabama is then given a 70 percent chance to beat Georgia by a projected score of 23-17.    Overall, Sportsline gives the Tide a 46 percent chance of winning the playoff with the Bulldogs coming in with a 20 percent chance. Clemson and Oklahoma are given a 17 percent chance. However, the Tide and Sooners are one-point and three-point favorites, respectively, according to the WestGate superbook. Remember, this marks the first time in the playoff era that two teams from the same conference were chosen among the final four.  Opening lines @WestgateVegas  Alabama (-1) vs. Clemson Oklahoma (-3) vs. Georgia ‚Äî Chris Fallica (@chrisfallica) December 3, 2017   Sportsline projected earlier that Alabama would be a three-point favorite over Ohio State , the No. 5 team left out of the playoff, if the two were to meet on a neutral field.

The winner gets ultimate bragging rights, an SEC title and a ticket punched to the College Football Playoff. Georgia is fresh off a throttling of Georgia Tech in Atlanta 38-7 at Bobby Dodd Stadium, while Auburn handled Alabama 26-14 in Jordan-Hare Stadium last week to take the SEC West crown. SportsLine The latest advice on the SEC Championship Game The Tigers are 2.5-point favorites over the Bulldogs in the SEC on CBS Game of the Week. Viewing information Date : Saturday, Dec. 2 | Time : 4 p.m. ET Location : Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, Georgia TV : CBS¬†| Live stream : CBSSports.com , CBS Sports App    Storylines Georgia: The Bulldogs got exposed a bit by Auburn the last time out, when the offensive line struggle to protect quarterback Jake Fromm , and running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel were constantly forced to change direction in the backfield. If they're going to have a chance this go-round, the offensive line will have to be better and coordinator Jim Chaney will have to mix in more screens, draws and other plays that neutralize Auburn's strength -- the defensive line. In November when the two met, Auburn forced Georgia out of its comfort zone, and the Bulldogs had no answer. They have to prevent that from happening in the rematch. Auburn: For the Tigers, it's all about the healthy of running back Kerryon Johnson . The star junior left the win over Alabama with a shoulder injury, and has been the foundation of the Tiger offense throughout the season. With Kamryn Pettway also out, the last thing Auburn needs is an inexperienced back like Kam Martin shouldering the load. Nothing against Martin, but Auburn is elite when it has the proven force between the tackles and outside. If Johnson as at, or close, to 100 percent, Auburn can run away again. If not, it's going to be a fist fight. Prediction Before the season, I picked Georgia over Auburn in the SEC Championship Game with a College Football Playoff berth on the line. Today, I'm sticking to that pick. While I think Johnson is good enough during the week, a few hits from linebackers Roquan Smith and Lorenzo Carter might change that. Tigers coach Gus Malzahn will try to protect Johnson, the offense won't be as fluid and it will allow Georgia to hang around. If you allow Georgia to hang around, Chubb and Michel will take over. The Bulldogs will spring the upset with a statement drive in the fourth quarter that results in the game-winning field goal to send them to the CFP.

For the Bulldogs and their fans, this is an opportunity decades in the making. Georgia has not played for a national title since 1983 nor brought home the championship since 1980. The Crimson Tide, meanwhile, will be playing in their third straight title game and sixth over thel last nine seasons. Alabama is 4-1 in its previous five such games and defeated LSU 21-0 in that prior all-SEC meeting to win the 2011 title. Alabama coach Nick Saban and Georgia coach Kirby Smart have their history, as do their respective staffs. Will Saban move to 12-0 all-time against his former assistants, or will Smart's youth and guile give him an edge over his former boss? Here's what our panel of CBS Sports college football experts think will happen on Monday night.      Dennis Dodd       Jerry Palm       Barton Simmons       Chip Patterson       Tom Fornelli       Ben Kercheval       Barrett Sallee       Adam Silverstein       Brandon Wise  BAMA -4      Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Georgia       Alabama       Georgia  SU      Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Alabama       Alabama       Alabama       Georgia       Alabama       Georgia  So what side do you need to be all over in the National Championship Game? Visit SportsLine now to get a strong pick for Alabama vs. Georgia from SEC football guru Barrett Sallee , who's on a red-hot 27-18 run in against the spread picks.    2018 College Football Playoff predictions Dennis Dodd, senior college football insider: Alabama's defense is "fixed." Not that it was ever broken, but this unit simply wasn't up to Nick Saban's own standards this season. But going from giving up 35 to Clemson a year ago to six last Monday sends an encouraging message. Sony Michel and Nick Chubb aren't going to have free run of the field like they did against Oklahoma. Despite losing linebacker Anfernee Jennings, the D is dialed in. Alabama 21, Georgia 17 Barton Simmons, senior college football writer: We're all programmed to overthink this game, dig into the details of every matchup, every strength, every weakness. But this matchup in particular is two evenly matched teams with two very similar identities on both offense and defense who do it with personnel that is pretty even. So in a game like this, it boils down to execution, and I just trust Georgia to execute better. The game will be close, and it may just be a matter of two mistake-averse teams waiting the other out to see who blinks first. I trust Jake Fromm and Georgia slightly more to win that staring contest. While Georgia played in the closer, more emotional contest in the semifinals, Alabama played in the more physical game that cost it two starters. With razor thin margins, that will be enough for a three point win. Georgia 20, Alabama 17 Jerry Palm, CFP & bowls expert: Alabama has the best talent and the best coach. That is really all the reason you need to pick the Crimson Tide to win this game or any game. Obviously, Alabama does not win them all, but the Tide's problem this year has been more health than anything. The team is as healthy and motivated as it has been all year and has been in this situation before. Also, I don't know what it is about coaching against his former assistants, but Nick Saban is 11-0 in those games.¬† Make no mistake: Georgia is good enough to win this game, but I'm not going to bet on it. Alabama 20, Georgia 13 Chip Patterson, college football writer:  This just feels like a game that both teams are more than happy to play in a phone booth, and when it comes to strength-on-strength with a national championship on the line, the logical pick is Alabama. It would not surprise me if Georgia, in the midst of a wild year that will certainly spark more SEC championship and College Football Playoff runs in the future, pulls off the upset, but it will take a few turnovers and big special teams plays to get it done. The issues that Oklahoma had with alignments, run fits and open field tackling aren't going to be there for the Tide, so I just don't think that Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will be able to spring enough explosive runs to sustain drives against an Alabama defense that was in full boa constrictor mode against Clemson. Alabama 23, Georgia 16    Tom Fornelli, college football writer: I can't go against Alabama here. Yes, these two teams are similar, and both are very good. Georgia could win just as easily as Alabama, but I'm not going to pick the Dawgs to do it. The reason is simple: While they're near mirror images of one another, Alabama is better in the areas where it's better than Georgia than Georgia is in the spots it's better than Bama. Also, after watching last week's game, I fear that Alabama's defense is back in Death Machine mode, and God help anybody that gets in the way of Alabama's Death Machine. Alabama 27, Georgia 21 Barrett Sallee, college football writer: It comes down to one simple thing: Georgia is a more complete football team than Alabama. They prefer to get down and dirty and play the physical style Alabama is known for playing, but can also open it up when they need to -- as they showed in the Rose Bowl when quarterback Jake Fromm led them down to tie the game at the end of regulation. Georgia will pick and choose its time to open things up, hit a few big plays and control the game throughout. Keep an eye on D'Andre Swift and Sony Michel as receivers out of the backfield. They could be big parts of the game plan as weapons during when coach Kirby Smart decides to get creative. Georgia 24, Alabama 17 Ben Kercheval, college football writer: Considering how dominant Alabama and Georgia's respective defensive fronts were in the semifinals, it should be no surprise this projects as a lower-scoring game. The difference is Georgia's smashmouth offense, while efficient, plays right into Alabama's strength on defense. If the Sugar Bowl taught us anything, it's that the Crimson Tide's death by slow suffocation is back and brutally effective as ever. Georgia won the Rose Bowl in a style that was out of its comfort zone. It doesn't feel like this is the type of game (or opponent) in which it can afford to do that again. Alabama 24, Georgia 20 Adam Silverstein, assistant managing editor: Experience counts -- not just on the field and on the sidelines but in the postseason. Add that to Georgia's extensive travel -- not just from California back to Georgia but between Athens and Atlanta constantly in preparation for the game -- and the Crimson Tide seem to have every off-the-field edge. And in a game featuring familiar coaches and defenses, those added advantages count. Add to that Jalen Hurts' mobility as an X-factor, and the fact that Alabama specializes in shutting down Georgia's strength (it's tremendous run game), and I think the curse of the favorites at recent championship games (0-4 ATS, 2-2 SU) comes to an end Monday. Alabama 27, Georgia 20    Brandon Wise, college football editor: Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will do something no other rushing duo in the country has accomplished: crack Alabama's vaunted front seven. With a little help from freshman Jake Fromm and a powerful offensive line, Chubb and Michel will methodically break the defense down and score multiple times to bring the Bulldogs a title.

Georgia. Crimson Tide. Bulldogs. Where I come from, a crimson tide means to stay out of the water. (You probably shouldn‚Äôt eat anything from the water either, but that‚Äôs never been a concern of mine given my laundry list of food allergies.)  Enough about me: The College Football Playoff National Championship is here! (And boy is it a mouthful.) Bama is back (shocker) and will face off against Georgia, who could be had at 50-1 over the summer. Nick Saban‚Äôs squad is looking to totally redeem itself after being upset last year as a 6.5-point favorite at the hands of Deshaun Watson and Clemson.  This year, oddsmakers believe it will be an even closer game. Let‚Äôs take a look at what the experts have to say. ‚Äì Mark Gallant  All info is as of Monday afternoon. For live spreads and bet percentages, check out this page . To get access to our premium tools, subscribe here .     The setup: Alabama (-3.5) vs. Georgia ¬†|¬† O/U: 45.5  Betting market: Alabama opened as 5.5-point favorites at 5Dimes; the line was then released across the market with the Tide as 4.5-point favorites. It appears the early bets from sharp bettors took Georgia and the under. Our Bet Signals data triggered Steam Moves on Georgia (+4) and the under (45). The consensus line moved from -3.5 to -4 early Monday afternoon, behind Alabama getting the majority of the overall tickets, but Georgia got steamed by some sharp money shortly thereafter, moving it back to +3.5. Alabama (64% of tickets) is the most popular National Championship bet since we started tracking data in 2005. ‚Äî PJ Walsh and Mark Gallant    Metrics overview: These teams are almost identical on both sides of the ball. Bama gains 6.7 yards per play on offense. Georgia: 6.9. Alabama allows 3.9 ypp on defense. Georgia: 4.6. Both offensive lines struggle in pass protection and thrive when run-blocking. ‚Äî Stuckey  The coaches: One reason these schools are so similar statistically? Their head coaches are cut from the same cloth. Georgia head coach Kirby Smart served as the defensive backs coach at LSU under Nick Saban in 2004. In 2006, Smart rejoined Saban with the Miami Dolphins before eventually serving multiple years as Alabama‚Äôs defensive coordinator. But wait, it goes deeper. Jeremy Pruitt, Smart‚Äôs replacement at Alabama, came from Georgia while Bulldogs defensive coordinator Mel Tucker worked as a DB coach under Saban at Alabama. The intense overlap between the two programs, both statistically and schematically, is what makes this game so difficult to handicap. ‚Äî Collin Wilson  A few coaching trends: Nick Saban is the sixth-most profitable coach in our database when listed as a favorite against a conference opponent: 49-39 ATS, a +$808 profit for a $100 bettor.  Saban is also 11-0 SU and 9-2 ATS when facing one of his former Alabama assistants, winning by an average of 28.7 PPG and covering the spread by 11.7 PPG. Seven of the 11 games were played away from Tuscaloosa; Saban outscored his assistants 293-71 (31.7 PPG differential) in those contests. One thing to consider, though: The average spread in those 11 games was -17, and Monday‚Äôs game will mark just the second time Saban faces a more assistant as less than a TD favorite. ‚Äî John Ewing and Evan Abrams  Did you know? Underdogs have covered in the past four national championship games. Since 2009, only three favorites have covered the spread in the national title: All three teams were coached by Saban (2009, 2011, 2012). ‚Äî Evan Abrams     When Alabama has the ball  What the metrics say: Alabama‚Äôs bread and butter on offense is the run-pass option (RPO). QB Jalen Hurts has masked his inability to throw downfield for two seasons thanks to great decision making when running RPOs. But Georgia‚Äôs front seven, led by freakish LB Roquan Smith, has shut down similar RPO-reliant QBs this season.  The average Passing Success Rate for a QB is 40%. Here‚Äôs what a few RPO QBs did vs. the Dawgs this season:   Brandon Wimbush, Notre Dame: 21% Passing Success Rate  Nick Fitzgerald, Mississippi State: 27%  Jarrett Stidham, Auburn: 31%  Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma: 37% ‚Äî Collin Wilson   DFS prospect to watch: WR Calvin Ridley. Ridley is widely expected to be a first-round pick, but he looks unlike a lot of successful Day 1 selections from previous seasons . Often compared to Amari Cooper, Ridley turned 21 as a true freshman: When Cooper was 21, he was in the NFL. When his advanced age is taken into account, Ridley‚Äôs 1,045-yard freshman season isn‚Äôt impressive and he‚Äôs regressed since then. Last year he had just 769 yards and this year he has just 16 percent of Alabama‚Äôs receiving touchdowns. With his smallish size (6‚Äô1‚Ä≥ and 190 pounds), Ridley will need to display good athleticism in his pre-draft workouts to justify his draft hype. ‚Äî Matthew Freedman     When Georgia has the ball  What the metrics say: Alabama boasts the nation‚Äôs No. 2 S&P+ Rush Defense , which will be critical against Georgia‚Äôs No. 8 ranked S&P+ Rush Offense . A deeper dive into the ground game matchup reveals that Alabama‚Äôs defense ranks in the top 15 in opportunity rate and adjusted line yards . Surprise surprise: Georgia‚Äôs offense also ranks in the top 15 of those two categories .  One advantage to keep an eye on: Georgia‚Äôs offense ranks 24th in Power Success Rate, defined as the percentage of runs that result in a first down on third-and-short and fourth-and-short. Alabama‚Äôs defense comes in at 119th overall.  Should this game be close late, watch out for Bama‚Äôs fourth-quarter defense, which ranks third in S&P+. ‚Äî Collin Wilson and Stuckey  Prop I‚Äôm eyeing: Jake Fromm over 15.5 completions. This is a tight line if you look at Fromm‚Äôs game log of completions. But Georgia has thrown more on first down in their past two games, and if Smart continues that trend to get Fromm some confidence, you‚Äôll see this sail over the total. ‚Äî Collin Wilson  Injury watch: Alabama‚Äôs injuries at linebacker didn‚Äôt hurt them against a Clemson offense that struggles to produce explosive plays. But with Georgia‚Äôs rushing attack adept at breaking the game open, the losses of Anfernee Jennings (out), Shaun Dion (doubtful), and Dylan Moses (out) could loom large for Bama‚Äôs D. ‚Äî Stuckey  DFS prospects to watch: RBs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel. As a freshman, Chubb looked like a future first-rounder in relief of lead back Todd Gurley, but then he tore multiple ligaments in his knee as a sophomore and was capably replaced by Michel. Chubb returned to action as a junior and since then, he and Michel have formed one of the most dynamic backfield duos in the history of college football. Last game they broke the all-time teammate rushing record held by Eric Dickerson and Craig James (8,192 career rushing yards). They now have 67 more yards than the Pony Express ‚Äî with 249 fewer carries . Both Chubb and Michel are Day 2 prospects with Day 1 potential. ‚Äî Matthew Freedman  Prop I‚Äôm eyeing:¬†D‚ÄôAndre Swift to score first TD +3500. This line is from 5Dimes and is a good reminder of why you should shop around for the best number with this stuff (it‚Äôs +1200 on BetOnline, for example). Swift had 88 yards and a TD on seven carries in the SEC title game, but he was barely used in the Rose Bowl. I can see him getting touches to provide a different look tonight. He has the ability to break a full-field TD from anywhere. ‚Äî Collin Wilson     A word about special teams  Georgia gets the nod here, as the Bulldogs lead the nation in Special Teams S&P+. Specifically, Georgia ranks fourth nationally in kickoff success rate while Alabama is only No. 105 in kickoff return success rate. Translation: You can expect Alabama‚Äôs starting field position to be at the 20 or less. Georgia‚Äôs field position off kickoffs has the potential to be much better, with Alabama‚Äôs JK Scott forcing a touchback just 47% of the time. The Dawgs should also benefit from placekicker Rodrigo Blankenship, who has been a little shaky from 40-49 yards (4-of-7), but has connected on a few key bombs this season, most notably a 55-yarder in the Rose Bowl. Alabama‚Äôs kicker, Andy Pappanastos, has gone just 4-of-8 on field goals of 40-49 yards this season, and Saban has yet to trust him with a kick of 50-plus. With the game expected to be heavy on defense and field position, Georgia‚Äôs advantage in the kicking game should not be overlooked. ‚Äî Collin Wilson     Which way are you leaning?  We both played Georgia and the under on the open and would still recommend both at anything +3.5 or higher and 44.5 and up (as always, shop for the best number). The first-half under is also worth a look. Listen, the margin in this game is razor thin. This is not a game we‚Äôd advise betting more on just because there‚Äôs a title up for grabs. These teams could not be more similar and the game will ultimately come down to the little things. One example is red zone efficiency. The Bulldogs score on 95.7 percent of their drives inside the 20 (fifth in the country) compared to 88.1 percent for Alabama (36th in the country). Those tiny advantages inside the red zone, on special teams and in high-leverage short-yardage situations add up over the course of the game and could ultimately swing the matchup in Georgia‚Äôs favor. ‚Äî Collin Wilson and Stuckey  Images for photo illustration via USA TODAY Sports   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit  Email           Related Posts           Where Will Alabama‚Äôs Nick Saban End Up in 2018?

Georgia-Auburn could be the most interesting and competitive SEC football game in the 2017 regular season. A trio of Week 11 matchups feature top 10 team vs. top 10 team, and this is the most intriguing.          College football betting picks, Georgia-Auburn  Georgia (9-0) was an underdog just twice all season ‚Äî at Notre Dame, and for just a few minutes at a single offshore book Sunday when Auburn opened as a 2-point favorite. UGA faces its biggest remaining threat to an unbeaten season. Auburn (7-2) can keep alive SEC Championship hopes by ending a 3-game losing streak in the Deep South‚Äôs Oldest Rivalry.  Auburn welcomed transfer QB Jarrett Stidham from Baylor and hired offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey to win precisely this type of game. And Georgia has been preparing freshman Jake Fromm, knowing there would be a game the Bulldogs couldn‚Äôt win solely with its running backs. Both teams play excellent defense, and both hope to usurp the Alabama Crimson Tide as the SEC‚Äôs alpha program.  I can‚Äôt wait for this game. Finally, an SEC on CBS matchup worthy of that designation.  MyBookie line (Nov. 9) : Georgia -2.5  MyBookie total (Nov. 9) : 47  How Georgia can win: Stuff the middle with Trenton Thompson, Roquan Smith and others, forcing the game into the hands of Jarrett Stidham. Shred Auburn‚Äôs offensive tackles like Clemson and LSU did earlier this season. Get a lead, run the ball effectively on offense and avoid making Jake Fromm conduct game-winning drives against an elite defense in front of a raucous road crowd.  How Auburn can win: Be aggressive. That means throwing downfield to Darius Slayton, Will Hastings and Nate Craig-Myers. And avoiding a complete breakdown of pass protection in the process. Auburn‚Äôs defense still ranks among the top 10 nationally in many categories, but has shown some cracks in recent weeks. The Tigers need to stymie UGA‚Äôs excellent running game, force Jake Fromm to determine the outcome of the game and hope to expose the still-inexperienced QB.          Here are a few additional nuggets:   Undefeated teams are 20-39-1 against the spread in November and December during the College Football Playoff era. That‚Äôs a bad trend for Georgia.  Top 10 teams that are home underdogs, a rare combination, are 12-25 straight up and 18-18-1 against the spread. That‚Äôs a bad trend for Auburn.  Georgia has won 9 of the last 11 in this series. Both of Auburn‚Äôs wins came at home, including the 2013 ‚ÄúPrayer at Jordan-Hare‚Äù and a 2010 duel between Cam Newton and Aaron Murray.   GEORGIA BULLDOGS  ATS : 6-3, +89  Over/Under : 3/6  Average line : -15  Average betting total : 49.6  Georgia started the season 5-0 against the spread vs. FBS teams, and reached a remarkable +104.5 at one point against the spread, excluding the Samford game. But it‚Äôs possible that the market has finally corrected itself. Maybe even over-corrected. UGA is 1-2 against the number since Oct. 7, with the lone win coming against Florida as the Gators were preparing to fire Jim McElwain the next day.  The ‚Äúover‚Äù also has hit in 3 of Georgia‚Äôs last 4 games.  F+/- combined ratings : No. 1  Offensive points per possession : No. 13  Defensive points per possession : No. 4  SOS : No. 29  According to every credible analytics number, Auburn is the second-best team that Georgia has faced all season, behind Notre Dame. Let‚Äôs use F+/-, which I view as the best college football analytics ranking. Georgia beat No. 2 Notre Dame on the road by 1 point and crushed No. 15 Mississippi State at home by 28. But both those teams are run-centric to an extreme, including at quarterback.          The next-best team that UGA has beaten? No. 58 South Carolina. Auburn is the first very good team Georgia has faced that possesses a legitimate pass offense.  Injuries   LB Natrez Patrick (marijuana-related suspension) is expected to play against Auburn after a 4-game absence. A starter before his suspension, Kirby Smart wouldn‚Äôt say whether Patrick would get his spot back right away.  DB Rashad Roundtree (concussion) has missed the entire season.  OL Pat Allen (leg) and DT DaQuan Hawkins-Muckle (back) are listed as questionable on a few injury websites.   Schedule Spot  After destroying Florida, 42-7, Georgia played a closer-than-expected game against South Carolina last week, clinching the SEC East. Kentucky is next, but this is the toughest game left for UGA in the regular season. Expect this team‚Äôs best effort.  Coaching/QBs     Coach  Year  Overall  SEC  Accolades    Kirby Smart  2nd  17-5  10-4  None as head coach     Smart has turned this UGA program into a juggernaut. He‚Äôs recruiting as well as any SEC program. The defense is elite. The running game is as good as any team‚Äôs in the country. And the team is passing effectively as well. In other words, Georgia is balanced. And in position to contend for championships for years to come.             Player  TDs  INTs  YPA  Comp. %    Jake Fromm  15  4  9.7  63.3%     Fromm has thrown more than 15 passes in just 3 games, but that includes 2 of the last 3. He‚Äôll make it 3 of 4 this week, as Georgia won‚Äôt be able to win this game by running the ball 50+ times. He‚Äôs also thrown for more than 201 yards just once. But he‚Äôs been scary efficient, and when he does throw, it‚Äôs usually for big yardage. He‚Äôs been very accurate downfield.  A big effort from Fromm in this game will eliminate any doubters and cement this team as a national championship contender. But it‚Äôs Auburn‚Äôs job to make Fromm win the game rather than manage it.  AUBURN TIGERS  ATS : 3-5-1, +26  Over/Under : 6/3  Average line : -17.1  Average betting total : 53.6  Auburn‚Äôs games have gone ‚Äúover‚Äù the betting total 6 consecutive times. Auburn has scored 51, 49, 44, 52 and 42 points against SEC opponents in 5 of those 6 games. In the sixth, Auburn scored 23 first-half points at LSU and then didn‚Äôt score in the second half. So, excluding a single half ‚Äî in which Auburn‚Äôs offense went into a conservative shell ‚Äî the Tigers are averaging 47.5 points per game against SEC teams.  F+/- combined ratings : No. 11  Offensive points per possession : No. 24  Defensive points per possession : No. 11  SOS : No. 15  Just 7 FBS teams rank in the top 25 in both offensive and defensive points per possession (adjusted to remove points scored on defense and special teams): Alabama, Georgia, Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Washington, UCF ‚Ä¶ and Auburn.          And although the team‚Äôs offense has been explosive during SEC play, the defense has performed even better ‚Äî holding Clemson to 14 points, Missouri to 14 points and Mississippi State to 10 points.  Injuries   The health of Auburn‚Äôs offensive line remained the biggest question mark as of Friday. Tackle Darius James and left guard Mike Horton played last week but left the game vs. Texas A&M due to lingering ankle injuries. Casey Dunn also has been dealing with a lingering injury. It‚Äôs unclear who will start at what positions , though Gus Malzahn said everyone should be available.  Oft-injured RB Kamryn Pettway (shoulder) could be out the rest of the season.   Schedule Spot  Auburn beat Texas A&M comfortably last week off a bye, and gets Louisiana-Monroe next week. The Iron Bowl looms on the horizon, but the Tigers need this one badly.  Win out, and Auburn could sneak into the College Football Playoff. Lose to UGA and Bama and coach Gus Malzahn could be fired. That‚Äôs the type of range at stake. Expect a focused effort.  Coaching/QBs     Coach  Year  Overall  SEC  Accolades    Gus Malzahn  5th  42-20  23-15  SEC Coach of the Year in 2013; SEC Championship in 2013     Malzahn‚Äôs two worst traits as a head coach, at least this year: 1) He gets too conservative after halftime leads and 2) He tries to prove he‚Äôs the smartest guy in the stadium and sometimes gets too cute. It cost Auburn the game against LSU ‚Äî otherwise this team is 8-1 right now.  Auburn isn‚Äôt going to get a three-score lead against Georgia on Saturday. So we should get Aggressive Auburn for 60 minutes. And Aggressive Auburn is very, very good.  If Malzahn loses this one, though, his job is very much in jeopardy.     Player  TDs  INTs  YPA  Comp. %    Jarrett Stidham  11  3  9.1  66.8%     The hype around Stidham before the season probably was unfair. His offensive tackles aren‚Äôt very good at protecting him. His receivers haven‚Äôt been as good as their star ratings suggested they should be. But Stidham is very good when he gets a clean pocket. He‚Äôs as accurate as any quarterback in the SEC in those situations. And Georgia‚Äôs secondary should give him some opportunities to make plays downfield.  THE WIZARD‚ÄôS PREDICTION  Bet: Auburn +2.5.  Score: Auburn 27, Georgia 24  I‚Äôve felt that Auburn has been underrated by the market, the media and the general public almost all season. And thanks to some terrible coaching in the second half in Baton Rouge, this team remains a clear and distant third in most folks‚Äô SEC power rankings.  The Tigers could very well finish 8-4 ‚Äî with losses to as many as 3 College Football Playoff teams.  Yes, Georgia beat Notre Dame and Mississippi State. But this is the best, most balanced SEC team UGA will face all season, at least until a potential SEC Championship Game matchup with Alabama.  I think the markets are overvaluing Georgia right now because of the 0 in the loss column. (See: Last week, when Georgia didn‚Äôt come close to covering as a 24-point favorite against South Carolina.)  I also like the ‚Äúover‚Äù in this matchup, which has hit in 6 consecutive Auburn games and in 3 of Georgia‚Äôs last 4 games, as noted above.
