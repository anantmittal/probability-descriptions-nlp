                                    The Monty Hall Problem          With Two Dice, What’s the Probability of Rolling Doubles? June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

My name is Carmen! I am a member of a grade 5 class in Edmonton, AB. We were talking about probability in math, and I was wanted to know what the probability (odds) of rolling two sixes would be rolling two dice? If it is not to difficult could you tell me what the probability (odds) of rolling any number with two dice were?  Thank You!  Sincerely, Carmen Hi Carmen, First of all we will find how many possible outcomes we have rolling two dice. 
Assume that the first one is Green, the second is Red. Then all possible 
outcomes can be represented in the following table. The numbers in the top row are the possibilities for the red die and the numbers in the first column are the possibilities for the green die. The numbers on the purple background are the sum of the numbers on the red and green dice.    You can see that we have 36 possible outcomes. We are interested only in ONE 
outcome, a 6 on the red die and a 6 on the green die. This gives a total of 12. Thus only one of the 36 possible outcomes has a 6 on both dice and hence the probability of two sixes will be 1 over 36, or 1/36.
Odds in favour 1 to 35, where 35 = 36-1.  For your second question you can read the probabilities off the table. For example suppose you want "the probability of rolling a 4", that is the probability that the sum on the two dice is 4. From the table, there are 3 of the possible 36 outcomes that have a sum of 4. Hence the probability of rolling a 3 is 3/36 = 1/12.

Hi Matt.  All the rolls are independent, so rolling double sixes twice in a row is the same as rolling a six (on one die) four times in a row. Since there are six choices, then each time there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a six.  The fact they are entirely independent of each other means we simply multiply each roll's probability together: 1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 = (1/6) 4 = 1/1296 = 0.00077.  Now let's say you had already rolled double sixes. What is the probability of rolling double sixes on your next roll? The answer is 1/36. The past rolls are entirely independent of future rolls, so history doesn't matter.  Stephen.

Date: Tue, 09 Jun 1998 19:16:35 -0600 From: Bruce Subject: math question what is the probablity of rolling two dice and it coming out as seven? a) 1/6 b) 1/36 please give me the correct awnser and explain please. Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

A Simple Probability Error Almost Everyone Makes (Including this Gambling Author)   by Matt    Tweet  The following is from Joseph Mazur’s new book, What’s Luck Got to Do with It? :  …there is an authentically verified story that sometime in the 1950s a [roulette] wheel in Monte Carlo came up even twenty-eight times in straight succession.  The odds of that happening are close to 268,435,456 to 1.  Based on the number of coups per day at Monte Carlo, such an event is likely to happen only once in five hundred years.                     Mazur uses this story to backup an argument which holds that, at least until very recently, many roulette wheels were not at all fair.  Assuming the math is right (we’ll check it later), can you find the flaw in his argument?  The following example will help.  The Probability of Rolling Doubles  Imagine you hand a pair of dice to someone who has never rolled dice in her life.  She rolls them, and gets double fives in her first roll.  Someone says, “Hey, beginner’s luck!  What are the odds of that on her first roll?”  Well, what are they?  There are two answers I’d take here, one much better than the other.  The first one goes like this.  The odds of rolling a five with one die are 1 in 6; the dice are independent so the odds of rolling another five are 1 in 6; therefore the odds of rolling double fives are  $$(1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36$$.  1 in 36.  By this logic, our new player just did something pretty unlikely on her first roll.  But wait a minute.  Wouldn’t ANY pair of doubles been just as “impressive” on the first roll?  What we really should be calculating are the odds of rolling doubles, not necessarily fives.  What’s the probability of that?  Since there are six possible pairs of doubles, not just one, we can just multiply by six to get 1/6. Another easy way to compute it: The first die can be anything at all.  What’s the probability the second die matches it?  Simple: 1 in 6.  (The fact that the dice are rolled simultaneously is of no consequence for the calculation.)  Not quite so remarkable, is it?  For some reason, a lot of people have trouble grasping that concept.  The chances of rolling doubles with a single toss of a pair of dice is 1 in 6.  People want to believe it’s 1 in 36, but that’s only if you specify which pair of doubles must be thrown.  Now let’s reexamine the roulette “anomaly”  This same mistake is what causes Joseph Mazur to incorrectly conclude that because a roulette wheel came up even 28 straight times in 1950, it was very likely an unfair wheel.  Let’s see where he went wrong.  There are 37 slots on a European roulette wheel .  18 are even, 18 are odd, and one is the 0, which I’m assuming does not count as either even or odd here.  So, with a fair wheel, the chances of an even number coming up are 18/37.  If spins are independent, we can multiply probabilities of single spins to get joint probabilities, so the probability of two straight evens is then (18/37)*(18/37).  Continuing in this manner, we compute the chances of getting 28 consecutive even numbers to be $$(18/37)^{28}$$.  Turns out, this gives us a number that is roughly twice as large (meaning an event twice as rare) as Mazur’s calculation would indicate.  Why the difference?  Here’s where Mazur got it right: He’s conceding that a run of 28 consecutive odd numbers would be just as interesting (and is just as likely) as a run of evens.  If 28 odds would have come up, that would have made it into his book too, because it would be just as extraordinary to the reader.  Thus, he doubles the probability we calculated, and reports that 28 evens in a row or 28 odds in a row should happen only once every 500 years.  Fine.  But what about 28 reds in a row?  Or 28 blacks?  Here’s the problem: He fails to account for several more events that would be just as interesting. Two obvious ones that come to mind are 28 reds in a row and 28 blacks in a row.  There are 18 blacks and 18 reds on the wheel (0 is green).  So the probabilities are identical to the ones above, and we now have two more events that would have been remarkable enough to make us wonder if the wheel was biased.  So now, instead of two events (28 odds or 28 evens), we now have four such events.  So it’s almost twice as likely that one would occur.  Therefore, one of these events should happen about every 250 years, not 500.  Slightly less remarkable.  What about other unlikely events?  What about a run of 28 numbers that exactly alternated the entire time, like even-odd-even-odd, or red-black-red-black?  I think if one of these had occurred, Mazur would have been just as excited to include it in his book.  These events are just as unlikely as the others.  We’ve now almost doubled our number of remarkable events that would make us point to a broken wheel as the culprit.  Only now, there are so many of them, we’d expect that one should happen every 125 years.  Finally, consider that Mazur is looking back over many years when he points out this one seemingly extraordinary event that occurred.  Had it happened anytime between 1900 and the present, I’m guessing Mazur would have considered that recent enough to include as evidence of his point that roulette wheels were biased not too long ago.  That’s a 110-year window.  Is it so surprising, then, that something that should happen once every 125 years or so happened during that large window?  Not really.  Slightly unlikely perhaps, but nothing that would convince anyone that a wheel was unfair.

For example, this will help you realise that (2, 3) and (3, 2) are not the same way to get a total of 5. There are 6 ways to get doubles and there are 4 ways to get a sum of 5. List them if you need to. These are mutually exclusive (doubles always have an even total). There are 36 possible results. The rest is easy. 2.5k Views · Answer requested by  Mary L.

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Jun Park Answered Mar 11, 2018 The probability of never rolling double 9s when rolling, let's say two rather than multiple, 10 sided dice, on each attempt is 0.99. There are exactly 100 possible outcomes and only one is double 9s. This means there are 99 outcomes that are not double 9s. Therefore, the probability of not getting double 9s on each attempt is 99/100. If you roll two dice multiple times, the probability of not rolling double 9s would decrease. On one attempt, the probability is 0.99. One two attempts, it is 0.99x0.99 or approximately 0.98. On three attempts, it is 0.99x0.99x0.99 or approximately 0.97 and so on. 65 Views Related Questions More Answers Below Two 6-sided dice are rolled.

Let’s say these were both 2s. Then for the second roll, (1/6)(1/6) since there is a 1/6 chance the first will be a 2 and another 1/6 chance the second will also be a 2. For the third roll, again it would be (1/6)(1/6). Then we would use the multiplication rule since this is an “and” problem.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Statistics and Probability Homework Question  Mathematics Homework Question You are playing a board game in which every turn, you roll 2 dice. However, you cannot begin until you roll doubles (the same number on both dice). If you do not roll doubles, you lose the turn, and must try again next turn. How many turns do you lose until you finally get the doubles you need to start? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers Quora User , University Webmaster and Programmer (1999-present) Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 3k answers and 1.3m answer views Assuming the dice are standard six-sided cubes, the odds of any given number are one in six. To find the odds of doubles on a single roll of two dice, consider the dice one at a time. The first die doesn't affect the probability in any way; all it says is which of six equally likely numbers you need from the second die. In other words, no matter which number the first die rolls, there is a one in six chance that the second die will match it, giving you doubles. Of course, that's still not what you asked. To find out how many rolls it is likely to take before you get doubles, a bit more calculation is needed. For this, it helps to consider the odds of getting non -doubles for some number of rolls in a row. That is the number of rolls you have to wait before you get to move. For a single roll, because doubles only have a one-in-six chance, non-doubles have a five in six chance. For multiple rolls, multiply the single-roll probability by itself once for every roll beyond the first. To do that you need to convert five-in-six odds into a number; just divide five by six, which makes 0.8333... with the three repeating forever. For simplicity I'll round that to 0.83, which can also be stated as 83 percent; in other words, you have an 83% chance of not getting doubles on any one roll. So the probability that your first two rolls aren't double is 0.83 times 0.83, or about 69 percent. For three rolls, it's 0.83 times 0.83 times 0.83, which is about a 58 percent chance that you don't get to go in your first three rolls. The probability of four rolls without doubles is about 48 percent, finally less than an even chance. This means you are slightly more likely to get doubles within your first four rolls than you are to have four unsuccessful rolls in a row. Of course this is hardly a guarantee, so let's go on a bit more. Five non-doubles has a 40 percent probability, and for six it's 33 percent. So, one out of every three times I play this game, I'll still be stuck after six rolls. I don't think this would be my favorite game. 937 Views Related Questions More Answers Below How to fix “Screen Overlay Detected” in any android device?

Sarnat , Physician / Anesthesiologist Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 562 answers and 613.1k answer views The chances of rolling a double is 1/6 per roll (6 out of 36 possible outcomes). So the chances of not rolling doubles is 5/6 per roll. A measure of expected number  of rolls is the 50-50 point, for which  you are equally likely to get doubles as not. (5/6)^4 = 0.482, meaning that the chances are 48% of rolling no doubles in 4 rolls, so the chances of rolling at least one double in the first four rolls is 52%.  In other words, in 4 rolls you are slightly more likely than not to get doubles. You can compute it exactly: (5/6)^N=1/2 Take log of both sides, rearrange N = log(1/2) / log(5/6) = approx 3.80 rolls of the dice. Of course, it could take 1000 rolls if you're very unlucky!

Hi Matt.  All the rolls are independent, so rolling double sixes twice in a row is the same as rolling a six (on one die) four times in a row. Since there are six choices, then each time there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a six.  The fact they are entirely independent of each other means we simply multiply each roll's probability together: 1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 = (1/6) 4 = 1/1296 = 0.00077.  Now let's say you had already rolled double sixes. What is the probability of rolling double sixes on your next roll? The answer is 1/36. The past rolls are entirely independent of future rolls, so history doesn't matter.  Stephen.

Chicago, ...     4.9   4.9  (30 lesson ratings)  (30)               0            When we have a probability question that asks the probability of one event OR another event, we want to ADD the two probabilities together.    If the question were what is the probability of rolling a 3 or a 4 on one die, the answer would be the probability of rolling a 3 (1/6) PLUS the probability of rolling a 4 (1/6), or 2/6 = 1/3.    Here we have two dice. The number of different outcomes on two dice is the number of different outcomes on the first die (6) TIMES the number of different outcomes on the second (6), or 36.    The probability of rolling doubles is 1/6, because there are 6 ways to roll doubles. 6/36 = 36.    Now we want to count the number of ways of rolling a sum of two. There's only one: 1 and 1.    However, 1 1 was already counted when we counted the number of ways to roll doubles. That is, there's no way to roll a sum of two without rolling doubles. So the number of ways of rolling doubles OR a sum of two is still only 6.    6/36 = 1/6.     6/10/2016 | Gary D.

In this case, P(A) (rolling a 5) = 1/9 and P(B) (rolling doubles) = 1/6.  But what is P(A and B)?    Well, if you think about it, there's no way to roll 5 AND doubles.  If you roll doubles, the sum of the two dice is going to be an even number, and 5 is odd.  You can't have the same on both dice and add up to 5!  So P(A and B) = 0.    So the answer is:  1/9 + 1/6 - 0 = 5/18.         4/2/2015 |  Jon P.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

 Every one of this can happen in 3 different ways, that is (1,1,x) (1,x,1) (x,1,1) = 3 ways. 
 Now x can be any of the remaining 5 numbers.
 So total number of ways two of them can be same = 6 x 3 x 5 = 90  So probability of the event = 90/216 = 5/12     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 13 '13 at 20:43       MDW   151 8              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      I will assume that "doubles" does not include triples.
Imagine the dice are coloured blue, white, and red. Record the outcome as a triple $(b,w,r)$, where $b$ is the number on the blue, and so on. There are $6^3$ possible outcomes, all equally likely.  How many doubles are there? The number we have two of can be chosen in $6$ ways. For each choice, the number we have one of can be chosen in $5$ ways, and its location (colour) can be chosen in $3$ ways, for a total of $(6)(5)(3)$. the required probability is therefore $\frac{(6)(5)(3)}{6^3}$.  Another way: The probability all the tosses are the same is $\frac{1}{36}$, since whatever we get on the blue, we must get on the white and on the red.  The probability the tosses are all different is $\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{4}{6}$. So the probability of not getting a double is $\frac{1}{36}+\frac{20}{36}$. It follows that the probability of a double is $\frac{15}{36}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 14 '13 at 1:20             answered Oct 13 '13 at 20:47       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      $\displaystyle{%

Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with the first and second die is 6/36, or 1/6.  There is also a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the first and third die.  And a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the second and third die.  Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with all three dice is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 or 1/2 (including triples).  The probability of rolling triples is 1/36 so the probability of rolling doubles with no triples is 18/36 - 1/36 = 17/36.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 21 '17 at 19:43       user494128   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

One die rolls a 6.  What is the probability of rolling a double 6?  One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance).  Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1).

You have rolled a six. Now for a double-six, you need to get a 6 on the
second roll. The second roll is independent of the first. So the probability
of a 6 again on the second roll is $1/6.$  If both dice have already been rolled out of your sight, and you are
told that there is at least one 6, then conditional on that information, what is the probability that the dice actually show a double-6. Then the analysis
of @Shayne2020 (+1) leading to the answer $1/11$ is correct.      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '17 at 0:46             answered Oct 27 '17 at 22:55       BruceET   29.6k 5 14 39              add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      This can be phrased as   Given that at least one die rolls a 6, what is the probability of rolling a double 6?   We can use the conditional probability formula:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\ \mathrm{and}\ B)}{P(B)}$$
This means "the probability of event A given event B, is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B".  \begin{align}
P(\mathrm{double\ 6}|\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6}) &= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\
&= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\

This doesn't clarify which one. Was it the first die or the second one? (Note that the dice are distinguishable by the turn of their throws.)  So, the latter logic is correct. The conditional probability reduces the sample space $S$ into ${(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) (6, 1)}$  Now, $|S|= 11$  And the only favorable outcome (rolling two 6's ) is $(6,6)$.

Maths isn't my strong suit. Little help?  'Kay, so the odds of rolling a double on 2d6 is nice and simple. There are 6 possible ways of rolling doubles on 2d6 out of a possible 36 combinations, so (1/(6*6))*6 = 0.167, or a 17ish percent chance of rolling a double.  There are 24 combinations of a d6 and a d4, and 4 ways of rolling doubles. So (1/(6*4))*4 = ... also 0.167. Exactly the same chance of rolling a double.  That doesn't seem right to me?

I  can't see inside your head to know your intuition but my guess is it's something like: "The $5$ and the $6$ are impossible to roll doubles with, so them being there reduces the odds of rolling doubles." And you know what, you're right, it does. The problem is you're comparing to the wrong baseline. You should compare to the odds of rolling doubles on two four-sided dice, which is $1/4.$ When you put the $5$ and $6$ on one of the dice, it reduces that to $1/6.$  If I got your reasoning wrong, at least be assured your answer is right.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 2 '17 at 8:56       spaceisdarkgreen   23k 2 13 41                  Yep, that was my thinking.

In the second case, make sure that the d4 is the first die you throw.

For instance, (1,1),(2,1),(3,4),(2,2),(3,3),(6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(5,1),(2,1) is a good roll, because all possible doubles occur.  My idea is to use the inclusion–exclusion principle:  $$
X=36^{10} - 6*35^{10} + {{6}\choose{2}}*34^{10} - {{6}\choose{3}}*33^{10} +... =\sum_{i=0}^{6}{(-1)^{i}*{{6}\choose{i}}*(36-i)^{10}}
$$
Therefore the solution is:
$$
X/36^{10}
$$  Could you check if my solution is proper or show me the simpler one?    probability  combinatorics  dice     share | cite | improve this question      edited Mar 2 '14 at 14:57             asked Mar 2 '14 at 13:33       Esserath   21 7              1      What is the probability of rolling doubles on the first roll?

The number $R$ of red balls drawn is binomially distributed; i.e., the probability $p_r$ that we draw exactly $r$ red balls is  given by
$$p_r={10\choose r}\left({1\over6}\right)^r\left({5\over 6}\right)^{10-r}\qquad(0\leq r\leq 10)\ .$$  Assuming that we draw exactly $r$ red balls, the numbers on these $r$ balls define a map $f:\ [r]\to[6]$, and all $6^r$ such maps are equally likely. Out of these maps $6!\left\{\matrix{r \cr 6\cr}\right\}$ are surjective, where $\left\{\matrix{r \cr 6\cr}\right\}$ (called a Stirling number of the second kind)  denotes the number of ways to partition $[r]$ into $6$ nonempty blocks. Therefore the probability $q_r$ that on the $r$ red balls drawn all $6$ numbers are present, is given by 
$$q_r={6!\left\{\matrix{r \cr 6\cr}\right\}\over 6^r}\qquad(6\leq r\leq10)\ .$$
It follows that the overall probability $P$ of the event described in the question is given by
$$P=\sum_{r=6}^{10} p_r\>q_r={416216045\over8463329722368}\doteq0.0000491788\ .$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 2 '14 at 18:42             answered Mar 2 '14 at 15:55       Christian Blatter   154k 7 100 295              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      We can bound it as follows:  One calculation is to compute the chance we get exactly six doubles, one of each type.  We have to choose six of the rolls to be doubles, and order of the doubles, and the four non-double rolls, so $\frac {{10 \choose 6}6!30^4}{36^{10}}\approx 00000335$  An upper bound would be to change allow the other rolls to be anything.  We will now double count the ones with one extra double.  That gives $\frac {{10 \choose 6}6!36^4}{36^{10}}\approx 0.0000695$  The first subtraction is seven doubles: $6$ ways to choolse the pair of doubles, $10 \choose 2$ to locate them, ${8 \choose 5}5!$ to locate and order the other doubles, $36^3$ for the other rolls for a probability of $\frac {6{10 \choose 2}{8 \choose 5}5!36^3}{36^{10}}\approx 0.0000023$  The real result is close to the $0.0000695$ number.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 2 '14 at 15:56       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

This is the way I thought about the problem. Let $X$ be the random variable describing the number of occurrences of a number $a$, where $1 \leq a \leq 6$. Then the probability that $a$ occurs twice is the binomial  $P(X=2) = {5 \choose 2}(\frac{1}{6})^2(\frac{5}{6})^3 = 0.16$  Now there are 6 possibilities for $a$, so the probability of rolling a pair of any number between one and six is $0.16*6 = 0.96$.  I don't know where I went wrong  but the final answer I get seems wrong intuitively to me. I would be grateful for some correction or verification.    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:05             asked Nov 28 '14 at 13:53       Björn   6 3              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote      You can't simply add the probabilities $P(X=2)$ as $a$ ranges over $1,\dots, 6$, since the events of rolling two of a number aren't mutually exclusive (it is possible to roll two ones and two fives). Furthermore, you would want to look at $P(X\ge 2)$, not $P(X=2)$, since having 3 or more of a number also counts as having a matching pair.  I think the best way to do this problem is first find the probability there is no mathcing pair, then subtract from 1. For the dice to be all different, there are 6 choices for the first die, 5 for the second, 4 for the third$\dots$, and $6^5$ possible rolls total, so the probability is
$$
1-\frac{6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2}{6^5}

If you want to add the probabilities of getting your pair rather than subtracting the probability of not getting a pair, you have to avoid double-counting.
As has already been mentioned, you can roll two $1$s and two $2$s in the same five rolls.
To compute the probability of exactly two $1$s and no other pairs,
you have $5$ choices for the first die that is not in the pair, but for each of those
there remain only $4$ choices for the next die, and at the end there are
only $3$ choices for the last die, so
$$P(\mbox{pair of twos}) = 
\binom52 \left(\frac16\right)^2 \cdot \frac56 \cdot \frac 46 \cdot \frac 36.$$
This event is mutually exclusive from having a pair of $2$s, so now it is OK to
multiply by $6$ to find the probability of having exactly one pair of exactly one number.  If you want at least one pair, then you must also add the probability of
having exactly one pair each of two different numbers
and the probability of having three or more of a single number
(which you could further subdivide into exactly three, exactly four, or five
of the same number).
This is much more tedious and error-prone than the method of subtracting the
probability of no pairs.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:37       David K   44.4k 3 35 95              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      I'm going to assume you're asking for the probability that there is at least one pair, not exactly one pair. These are of course different questions. The probability that there are no matching pairs given five dice rolled is
$$P=1\cdot\frac56\cdot\frac46\cdot\frac36\cdot\frac26=\frac5{54}.$$
The probability that there is at least one pair is $1-P=\frac{49}{54}$.  It isn't too much more difficult to work out the probability that there is exactly one pair. By symmetry and mutual exclusion, this is six times the probability that the number $a$ appears exactly twice and there are no other pairs. This is given by
$$Q=\frac{{5\choose{2}}\cdot{5\choose3}\cdot3!}{6^5}=\frac{25}{6\cdot54}$$
and so the probability is $\frac{25}{54}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:55             answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:12       Jason   11.6k 1 8 29                  Should that be $\binom53$ rather than $\binom43$ in the calculation of $Q$?

Of course, since the method of moving around the board involves rolling two dice , it is clear that there is some element of chance in the game. One of the places where this is evident is the portion of the game known as Jail. We will calculate two probabilities regarding Jail in the game of Monopoly. Description of Jail Jail in Monopoly is a space in which players can “Just Visit” on their way around the board, or where they must go if a few conditions are met.         While in Jail, a player can still collect rents and develop properties, but is not able to move around the board. This is a significant disadvantage early in the game when properties are not owned, as the game progresses there are times where it is more advantageous to stay in Jail, as it reduces the risk of landing on your opponents’ developed properties. There are three ways that a player can end up in Jail. One can simply land on the “Go to Jail” space of the board. One can draw a Chance or Community Chest card marked “Go to Jail.” One can roll doubles (both numbers on the dice are the same) three times in a row. There are also three ways that a player can get out of Jail Use a “Get out of Jail Free” card Pay $50 Roll doubles on any of the three turns after a player goes to Jail. We will examine the probabilities of the third item on each of the above lists. Probability of Going to Jail We will first look at the probability of going to Jail by rolling three doubles in a row.   There are six different rolls that are doubles (double 1, double 2, double 3, double 4, double 5 and double 6) out of a total of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. So on any turn, the probability of rolling a double is 6/36 = 1/6. Now each roll of the dice is independent. So the probability that any given turn will result in the rolling of doubles three times in a row is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/216.         This is approximately 0.46%. While this may seem like a small percentage, given the length of most Monopoly games, it is likely that this will happen at some point to someone during the game. Probability of Leaving Jail We now turn to the probability of leaving Jail by rolling doubles. This probability is slightly more difficult to calculate because there are different cases to consider: The probability that we roll doubles on the first roll is 1/6. The probability that we roll doubles on the second turn but not the first is (5/6) x (1/6) = 5/36. The probability that we roll doubles on the third turn but not the first or second is (5/6) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 25/216. So the probability of rolling doubles to get out of Jail is 1/6 + 5/36 + 25/216 = 91/216, or about 42%. We could calculate this probability in a different way. The complement of the event “roll doubles at least once over the next three turns” is “We don’t roll doubles at all over the next three turns.” Thus the probability of not rolling any doubles is (5/6) x (5/6) x (5/6) = 125/216. Since we have calculated the probability of the complement of the event that we want to find, we subtract this probability from 100%. We get the same probability of 1 – 125/216 = 91/216 that we obtained from the other method.  Probabilities of the Other Methods Probabilities for the other methods are difficult to calculate. They all involve the probability of landing on a particular space (or landing on a particular space and drawing a particular card). Finding the probability of landing on a certain space in Monopoly is actually quite difficult. This sort of problem can be dealt with by the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

June 12th, 2014  If you roll two six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling doubles?  To calculate your chance of rolling doubles, add up all the possible ways to roll doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3; 4,4; 5,5; 6,6). There are 6 ways we can roll doubles, or a probability of 6/36, or 1/6, on any roll of two fair dice. So you have a 16.7% probability of rolling doubles with 2 fair six-sided dice.  You can also think of a sample space of all 36 possible outcomes, with the doubles highlighted:   How about the probability of rolling snake eyes (1,1)? Well, using the sample space above, it’s 1/36. So your odds of rolling snake eyes are about 35 to 1. Not that common!    Click here to view archived puzzles...

It's lifted from another website , so just imagine that the 'white die' denotes your first roll, and the 'red die' denotes your second roll.  You'll notice that there are exactly $6$ pairs of rolls (out of all $36$ possible outcomes) in which the first roll equals the second roll.

For a specific number, say $1$, the probability of rolling it twice is equal to $$ \underbrace{\dfrac 16}_{1\text{st roll}}\;\times \;\underbrace{\dfrac 16}_{2\text{nd roll}}=\dfrac 1{36}$$ by the rule of the product .

My name is Carmen! I am a member of a grade 5 class in Edmonton, AB. We were talking about probability in math, and I was wanted to know what the probability (odds) of rolling two sixes would be rolling two dice? If it is not to difficult could you tell me what the probability (odds) of rolling any number with two dice were?  Thank You!  Sincerely, Carmen Hi Carmen, First of all we will find how many possible outcomes we have rolling two dice. 
Assume that the first one is Green, the second is Red. Then all possible 
outcomes can be represented in the following table. The numbers in the top row are the possibilities for the red die and the numbers in the first column are the possibilities for the green die. The numbers on the purple background are the sum of the numbers on the red and green dice.    You can see that we have 36 possible outcomes. We are interested only in ONE 
outcome, a 6 on the red die and a 6 on the green die. This gives a total of 12. Thus only one of the 36 possible outcomes has a 6 on both dice and hence the probability of two sixes will be 1 over 36, or 1/36.
Odds in favour 1 to 35, where 35 = 36-1.  For your second question you can read the probabilities off the table. For example suppose you want "the probability of rolling a 4", that is the probability that the sum on the two dice is 4. From the table, there are 3 of the possible 36 outcomes that have a sum of 4. Hence the probability of rolling a 3 is 3/36 = 1/12. Cheers, Andrei and Penny Go to Math Central              SEARCH  HOME       Math Central Quandaries & Queries          Question from matt:  what is the probability of rolling double sixes twice in a row?       Hi Matt.  All the rolls are independent, so rolling double sixes twice in a row is the same as rolling a six (on one die) four times in a row. Since there are six choices, then each time there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a six.  The fact they are entirely independent of each other means we simply multiply each roll's probability together: 1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 = (1/6) 4 = 1/1296 = 0.00077.  Now let's say you had already rolled double sixes. What is the probability of rolling double sixes on your next roll? The answer is 1/36. The past rolls are entirely independent of future rolls, so history doesn't matter.  Stephen.

Date: Tue, 09 Jun 1998 19:16:35 -0600 From: Bruce Subject: math question what is the probablity of rolling two dice and it coming out as seven? a) 1/6 b) 1/36 please give me the correct awnser and explain please. Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

A Simple Probability Error Almost Everyone Makes (Including this Gambling Author)   by Matt    Tweet  The following is from Joseph Mazur’s new book, What’s Luck Got to Do with It? :  …there is an authentically verified story that sometime in the 1950s a [roulette] wheel in Monte Carlo came up even twenty-eight times in straight succession.  The odds of that happening are close to 268,435,456 to 1.  Based on the number of coups per day at Monte Carlo, such an event is likely to happen only once in five hundred years.                     Mazur uses this story to backup an argument which holds that, at least until very recently, many roulette wheels were not at all fair.  Assuming the math is right (we’ll check it later), can you find the flaw in his argument?  The following example will help.  The Probability of Rolling Doubles  Imagine you hand a pair of dice to someone who has never rolled dice in her life.  She rolls them, and gets double fives in her first roll.  Someone says, “Hey, beginner’s luck!  What are the odds of that on her first roll?”  Well, what are they?  There are two answers I’d take here, one much better than the other.  The first one goes like this.  The odds of rolling a five with one die are 1 in 6; the dice are independent so the odds of rolling another five are 1 in 6; therefore the odds of rolling double fives are  $$(1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36$$.  1 in 36.  By this logic, our new player just did something pretty unlikely on her first roll.  But wait a minute.  Wouldn’t ANY pair of doubles been just as “impressive” on the first roll?  What we really should be calculating are the odds of rolling doubles, not necessarily fives.  What’s the probability of that?  Since there are six possible pairs of doubles, not just one, we can just multiply by six to get 1/6. Another easy way to compute it: The first die can be anything at all.  What’s the probability the second die matches it?  Simple: 1 in 6.  (The fact that the dice are rolled simultaneously is of no consequence for the calculation.)  Not quite so remarkable, is it?  For some reason, a lot of people have trouble grasping that concept.  The chances of rolling doubles with a single toss of a pair of dice is 1 in 6.  People want to believe it’s 1 in 36, but that’s only if you specify which pair of doubles must be thrown.  Now let’s reexamine the roulette “anomaly”  This same mistake is what causes Joseph Mazur to incorrectly conclude that because a roulette wheel came up even 28 straight times in 1950, it was very likely an unfair wheel.  Let’s see where he went wrong.  There are 37 slots on a European roulette wheel .  18 are even, 18 are odd, and one is the 0, which I’m assuming does not count as either even or odd here.  So, with a fair wheel, the chances of an even number coming up are 18/37.  If spins are independent, we can multiply probabilities of single spins to get joint probabilities, so the probability of two straight evens is then (18/37)*(18/37).  Continuing in this manner, we compute the chances of getting 28 consecutive even numbers to be $$(18/37)^{28}$$.  Turns out, this gives us a number that is roughly twice as large (meaning an event twice as rare) as Mazur’s calculation would indicate.  Why the difference?  Here’s where Mazur got it right: He’s conceding that a run of 28 consecutive odd numbers would be just as interesting (and is just as likely) as a run of evens.  If 28 odds would have come up, that would have made it into his book too, because it would be just as extraordinary to the reader.  Thus, he doubles the probability we calculated, and reports that 28 evens in a row or 28 odds in a row should happen only once every 500 years.  Fine.  But what about 28 reds in a row?  Or 28 blacks?  Here’s the problem: He fails to account for several more events that would be just as interesting. Two obvious ones that come to mind are 28 reds in a row and 28 blacks in a row.  There are 18 blacks and 18 reds on the wheel (0 is green).  So the probabilities are identical to the ones above, and we now have two more events that would have been remarkable enough to make us wonder if the wheel was biased.  So now, instead of two events (28 odds or 28 evens), we now have four such events.  So it’s almost twice as likely that one would occur.  Therefore, one of these events should happen about every 250 years, not 500.  Slightly less remarkable.  What about other unlikely events?  What about a run of 28 numbers that exactly alternated the entire time, like even-odd-even-odd, or red-black-red-black?  I think if one of these had occurred, Mazur would have been just as excited to include it in his book.  These events are just as unlikely as the others.  We’ve now almost doubled our number of remarkable events that would make us point to a broken wheel as the culprit.  Only now, there are so many of them, we’d expect that one should happen every 125 years.  Finally, consider that Mazur is looking back over many years when he points out this one seemingly extraordinary event that occurred.  Had it happened anytime between 1900 and the present, I’m guessing Mazur would have considered that recent enough to include as evidence of his point that roulette wheels were biased not too long ago.  That’s a 110-year window.  Is it so surprising, then, that something that should happen once every 125 years or so happened during that large window?  Not really.  Slightly unlikely perhaps, but nothing that would convince anyone that a wheel was unfair.

For example, this will help you realise that (2, 3) and (3, 2) are not the same way to get a total of 5. There are 6 ways to get doubles and there are 4 ways to get a sum of 5. List them if you need to. These are mutually exclusive (doubles always have an even total). There are 36 possible results. The rest is easy. 2.5k Views · Answer requested by  Mary L.

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Jun Park Answered Mar 11, 2018 The probability of never rolling double 9s when rolling, let's say two rather than multiple, 10 sided dice, on each attempt is 0.99. There are exactly 100 possible outcomes and only one is double 9s. This means there are 99 outcomes that are not double 9s. Therefore, the probability of not getting double 9s on each attempt is 99/100. If you roll two dice multiple times, the probability of not rolling double 9s would decrease. On one attempt, the probability is 0.99. One two attempts, it is 0.99x0.99 or approximately 0.98. On three attempts, it is 0.99x0.99x0.99 or approximately 0.97 and so on. 65 Views Related Questions More Answers Below Two 6-sided dice are rolled.

Let’s say these were both 2s. Then for the second roll, (1/6)(1/6) since there is a 1/6 chance the first will be a 2 and another 1/6 chance the second will also be a 2. For the third roll, again it would be (1/6)(1/6). Then we would use the multiplication rule since this is an “and” problem.

However, you cannot begin until you roll doubles (the same number on both dice). If you do not roll doubles, you lose the turn, and must try again next turn. How many turns do you lose until you finally get the doubles you need to start? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers Quora User , University Webmaster and Programmer (1999-present) Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 3k answers and 1.3m answer views Assuming the dice are standard six-sided cubes, the odds of any given number are one in six. To find the odds of doubles on a single roll of two dice, consider the dice one at a time. The first die doesn't affect the probability in any way; all it says is which of six equally likely numbers you need from the second die. In other words, no matter which number the first die rolls, there is a one in six chance that the second die will match it, giving you doubles. Of course, that's still not what you asked. To find out how many rolls it is likely to take before you get doubles, a bit more calculation is needed. For this, it helps to consider the odds of getting non -doubles for some number of rolls in a row. That is the number of rolls you have to wait before you get to move. For a single roll, because doubles only have a one-in-six chance, non-doubles have a five in six chance. For multiple rolls, multiply the single-roll probability by itself once for every roll beyond the first. To do that you need to convert five-in-six odds into a number; just divide five by six, which makes 0.8333... with the three repeating forever. For simplicity I'll round that to 0.83, which can also be stated as 83 percent; in other words, you have an 83% chance of not getting doubles on any one roll. So the probability that your first two rolls aren't double is 0.83 times 0.83, or about 69 percent. For three rolls, it's 0.83 times 0.83 times 0.83, which is about a 58 percent chance that you don't get to go in your first three rolls. The probability of four rolls without doubles is about 48 percent, finally less than an even chance. This means you are slightly more likely to get doubles within your first four rolls than you are to have four unsuccessful rolls in a row. Of course this is hardly a guarantee, so let's go on a bit more. Five non-doubles has a 40 percent probability, and for six it's 33 percent. So, one out of every three times I play this game, I'll still be stuck after six rolls. I don't think this would be my favorite game. 937 Views Related Questions More Answers Below How to fix “Screen Overlay Detected” in any android device?

Sarnat , Physician / Anesthesiologist Answered Jan 14, 2015 · Author has 562 answers and 613.1k answer views The chances of rolling a double is 1/6 per roll (6 out of 36 possible outcomes). So the chances of not rolling doubles is 5/6 per roll. A measure of expected number  of rolls is the 50-50 point, for which  you are equally likely to get doubles as not. (5/6)^4 = 0.482, meaning that the chances are 48% of rolling no doubles in 4 rolls, so the chances of rolling at least one double in the first four rolls is 52%.  In other words, in 4 rolls you are slightly more likely than not to get doubles. You can compute it exactly: (5/6)^N=1/2 Take log of both sides, rearrange N = log(1/2) / log(5/6) = approx 3.80 rolls of the dice. Of course, it could take 1000 rolls if you're very unlucky!

Hi Matt.  All the rolls are independent, so rolling double sixes twice in a row is the same as rolling a six (on one die) four times in a row. Since there are six choices, then each time there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a six.  The fact they are entirely independent of each other means we simply multiply each roll's probability together: 1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 ×  1/6 = (1/6) 4 = 1/1296 = 0.00077.  Now let's say you had already rolled double sixes. What is the probability of rolling double sixes on your next roll? The answer is 1/36. The past rolls are entirely independent of future rolls, so history doesn't matter.  Stephen.

Chicago, ...     4.9   4.9  (30 lesson ratings)  (30)               0            When we have a probability question that asks the probability of one event OR another event, we want to ADD the two probabilities together.    If the question were what is the probability of rolling a 3 or a 4 on one die, the answer would be the probability of rolling a 3 (1/6) PLUS the probability of rolling a 4 (1/6), or 2/6 = 1/3.    Here we have two dice. The number of different outcomes on two dice is the number of different outcomes on the first die (6) TIMES the number of different outcomes on the second (6), or 36.    The probability of rolling doubles is 1/6, because there are 6 ways to roll doubles. 6/36 = 36.    Now we want to count the number of ways of rolling a sum of two. There's only one: 1 and 1.    However, 1 1 was already counted when we counted the number of ways to roll doubles. That is, there's no way to roll a sum of two without rolling doubles. So the number of ways of rolling doubles OR a sum of two is still only 6.    6/36 = 1/6.     6/10/2016 | Gary D.

In this case, P(A) (rolling a 5) = 1/9 and P(B) (rolling doubles) = 1/6.  But what is P(A and B)?    Well, if you think about it, there's no way to roll 5 AND doubles.  If you roll doubles, the sum of the two dice is going to be an even number, and 5 is odd.  You can't have the same on both dice and add up to 5!  So P(A and B) = 0.    So the answer is:  1/9 + 1/6 - 0 = 5/18.         4/2/2015 |  Jon P.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

 Every one of this can happen in 3 different ways, that is (1,1,x) (1,x,1) (x,1,1) = 3 ways. 
 Now x can be any of the remaining 5 numbers.
 So total number of ways two of them can be same = 6 x 3 x 5 = 90  So probability of the event = 90/216 = 5/12     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 13 '13 at 20:43       MDW   151 8              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      I will assume that "doubles" does not include triples.
Imagine the dice are coloured blue, white, and red. Record the outcome as a triple $(b,w,r)$, where $b$ is the number on the blue, and so on. There are $6^3$ possible outcomes, all equally likely.  How many doubles are there? The number we have two of can be chosen in $6$ ways. For each choice, the number we have one of can be chosen in $5$ ways, and its location (colour) can be chosen in $3$ ways, for a total of $(6)(5)(3)$. the required probability is therefore $\frac{(6)(5)(3)}{6^3}$.  Another way: The probability all the tosses are the same is $\frac{1}{36}$, since whatever we get on the blue, we must get on the white and on the red.  The probability the tosses are all different is $\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{4}{6}$. So the probability of not getting a double is $\frac{1}{36}+\frac{20}{36}$. It follows that the probability of a double is $\frac{15}{36}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 14 '13 at 1:20             answered Oct 13 '13 at 20:47       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      $\displaystyle{%

Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with the first and second die is 6/36, or 1/6.  There is also a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the first and third die.  And a 1/6 chance of rolling doubles with the second and third die.  Therefore the probability of rolling doubles with all three dice is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 or 1/2 (including triples).  The probability of rolling triples is 1/36 so the probability of rolling doubles with no triples is 18/36 - 1/36 = 17/36.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 21 '17 at 19:43       user494128   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

One die rolls a 6.  What is the probability of rolling a double 6?  One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance).  Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1).

You have rolled a six. Now for a double-six, you need to get a 6 on the
second roll. The second roll is independent of the first. So the probability
of a 6 again on the second roll is $1/6.$  If both dice have already been rolled out of your sight, and you are
told that there is at least one 6, then conditional on that information, what is the probability that the dice actually show a double-6. Then the analysis
of @Shayne2020 (+1) leading to the answer $1/11$ is correct.      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '17 at 0:46             answered Oct 27 '17 at 22:55       BruceET   29.6k 5 14 39              add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      This can be phrased as   Given that at least one die rolls a 6, what is the probability of rolling a double 6?   We can use the conditional probability formula:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\ \mathrm{and}\ B)}{P(B)}$$
This means "the probability of event A given event B, is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B".  \begin{align}
P(\mathrm{double\ 6}|\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6}) &= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\
&= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\
&= \frac{1/36}{11/36}\\
&= \frac{1}{11}

This doesn't clarify which one. Was it the first die or the second one? (Note that the dice are distinguishable by the turn of their throws.)  So, the latter logic is correct. The conditional probability reduces the sample space $S$ into ${(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) (6, 1)}$  Now, $|S|= 11$  And the only favorable outcome (rolling two 6's ) is $(6,6)$.

There are 24 combinations of a d6 and a d4, and 4 ways of rolling doubles. So (1/(6*4))*4 = ... also 0.167. Exactly the same chance of rolling a double.  That doesn't seem right to me? I'd assumed that you'd be less likely to roll doubles on a d4 and a d6. So which is wrong, my maths or my intuition?﻿    probability  probability-distributions  dice     share | cite | improve this question     asked Jul 2 '17 at 8:49       synesthesia   103 3              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      Your math is right and your intuition wrong.  I  can't see inside your head to know your intuition but my guess is it's something like: "The $5$ and the $6$ are impossible to roll doubles with, so them being there reduces the odds of rolling doubles." And you know what, you're right, it does. The problem is you're comparing to the wrong baseline. You should compare to the odds of rolling doubles on two four-sided dice, which is $1/4.$ When you put the $5$ and $6$ on one of the dice, it reduces that to $1/6.$  If I got your reasoning wrong, at least be assured your answer is right.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 2 '17 at 8:56       spaceisdarkgreen   23k 2 13 41                  Yep, that was my thinking.

In the second case, make sure that the d4 is the first die you throw. Then it's obvious that in both cases it's a $1/6$ probability that the second die lands on whatever the first die showed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 2 '17 at 9:03       Arthur   89.9k 7 85 160              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

For instance, (1,1),(2,1),(3,4),(2,2),(3,3),(6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(5,1),(2,1) is a good roll, because all possible doubles occur.  My idea is to use the inclusion–exclusion principle:  $$
X=36^{10} - 6*35^{10} + {{6}\choose{2}}*34^{10} - {{6}\choose{3}}*33^{10} +... =\sum_{i=0}^{6}{(-1)^{i}*{{6}\choose{i}}*(36-i)^{10}}
$$
Therefore the solution is:
$$
X/36^{10}

The number $R$ of red balls drawn is binomially distributed; i.e., the probability $p_r$ that we draw exactly $r$ red balls is  given by
$$p_r={10\choose r}\left({1\over6}\right)^r\left({5\over 6}\right)^{10-r}\qquad(0\leq r\leq 10)\ .$$  Assuming that we draw exactly $r$ red balls, the numbers on these $r$ balls define a map $f:\ [r]\to[6]$, and all $6^r$ such maps are equally likely. Out of these maps $6!\left\{\matrix{r \cr 6\cr}\right\}$ are surjective, where $\left\{\matrix{r \cr 6\cr}\right\}$ (called a Stirling number of the second kind)  denotes the number of ways to partition $[r]$ into $6$ nonempty blocks. Therefore the probability $q_r$ that on the $r$ red balls drawn all $6$ numbers are present, is given by 
$$q_r={6!\left\{\matrix{r \cr 6\cr}\right\}\over 6^r}\qquad(6\leq r\leq10)\ .$$
It follows that the overall probability $P$ of the event described in the question is given by
$$P=\sum_{r=6}^{10} p_r\>q_r={416216045\over8463329722368}\doteq0.0000491788\ .$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 2 '14 at 18:42             answered Mar 2 '14 at 15:55       Christian Blatter   154k 7 100 295              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      We can bound it as follows:  One calculation is to compute the chance we get exactly six doubles, one of each type.  We have to choose six of the rolls to be doubles, and order of the doubles, and the four non-double rolls, so $\frac {{10 \choose 6}6!30^4}{36^{10}}\approx 00000335$  An upper bound would be to change allow the other rolls to be anything.  We will now double count the ones with one extra double.  That gives $\frac {{10 \choose 6}6!36^4}{36^{10}}\approx 0.0000695$  The first subtraction is seven doubles: $6$ ways to choolse the pair of doubles, $10 \choose 2$ to locate them, ${8 \choose 5}5!$ to locate and order the other doubles, $36^3$ for the other rolls for a probability of $\frac {6{10 \choose 2}{8 \choose 5}5!36^3}{36^{10}}\approx 0.0000023$  The real result is close to the $0.0000695$ number.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 2 '14 at 15:56       Ross Millikan   262k 21 175 328              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

This is the way I thought about the problem. Let $X$ be the random variable describing the number of occurrences of a number $a$, where $1 \leq a \leq 6$. Then the probability that $a$ occurs twice is the binomial  $P(X=2) = {5 \choose 2}(\frac{1}{6})^2(\frac{5}{6})^3 = 0.16$  Now there are 6 possibilities for $a$, so the probability of rolling a pair of any number between one and six is $0.16*6 = 0.96$.  I don't know where I went wrong  but the final answer I get seems wrong intuitively to me. I would be grateful for some correction or verification.    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:05             asked Nov 28 '14 at 13:53       Björn   6 3              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote      You can't simply add the probabilities $P(X=2)$ as $a$ ranges over $1,\dots, 6$, since the events of rolling two of a number aren't mutually exclusive (it is possible to roll two ones and two fives). Furthermore, you would want to look at $P(X\ge 2)$, not $P(X=2)$, since having 3 or more of a number also counts as having a matching pair.  I think the best way to do this problem is first find the probability there is no mathcing pair, then subtract from 1. For the dice to be all different, there are 6 choices for the first die, 5 for the second, 4 for the third$\dots$, and $6^5$ possible rolls total, so the probability is
$$
1-\frac{6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2}{6^5}

If you want to add the probabilities of getting your pair rather than subtracting the probability of not getting a pair, you have to avoid double-counting.
As has already been mentioned, you can roll two $1$s and two $2$s in the same five rolls.
To compute the probability of exactly two $1$s and no other pairs,
you have $5$ choices for the first die that is not in the pair, but for each of those
there remain only $4$ choices for the next die, and at the end there are
only $3$ choices for the last die, so
$$P(\mbox{pair of twos}) = 
\binom52 \left(\frac16\right)^2 \cdot \frac56 \cdot \frac 46 \cdot \frac 36.$$
This event is mutually exclusive from having a pair of $2$s, so now it is OK to
multiply by $6$ to find the probability of having exactly one pair of exactly one number.  If you want at least one pair, then you must also add the probability of
having exactly one pair each of two different numbers
and the probability of having three or more of a single number
(which you could further subdivide into exactly three, exactly four, or five
of the same number).
This is much more tedious and error-prone than the method of subtracting the
probability of no pairs.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:37       David K   44.4k 3 35 95              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      I'm going to assume you're asking for the probability that there is at least one pair, not exactly one pair. These are of course different questions. The probability that there are no matching pairs given five dice rolled is
$$P=1\cdot\frac56\cdot\frac46\cdot\frac36\cdot\frac26=\frac5{54}.$$
The probability that there is at least one pair is $1-P=\frac{49}{54}$.  It isn't too much more difficult to work out the probability that there is exactly one pair. By symmetry and mutual exclusion, this is six times the probability that the number $a$ appears exactly twice and there are no other pairs. This is given by
$$Q=\frac{{5\choose{2}}\cdot{5\choose3}\cdot3!}{6^5}=\frac{25}{6\cdot54}$$
and so the probability is $\frac{25}{54}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 28 '14 at 14:55             answered Nov 28 '14 at 14:12       Jason   11.6k 1 8 29                  Should that be $\binom53$ rather than $\binom43$ in the calculation of $Q$?

Of course, since the method of moving around the board involves rolling two dice , it is clear that there is some element of chance in the game. One of the places where this is evident is the portion of the game known as Jail. We will calculate two probabilities regarding Jail in the game of Monopoly. Description of Jail Jail in Monopoly is a space in which players can “Just Visit” on their way around the board, or where they must go if a few conditions are met.         While in Jail, a player can still collect rents and develop properties, but is not able to move around the board. This is a significant disadvantage early in the game when properties are not owned, as the game progresses there are times where it is more advantageous to stay in Jail, as it reduces the risk of landing on your opponents’ developed properties. There are three ways that a player can end up in Jail. One can simply land on the “Go to Jail” space of the board. One can draw a Chance or Community Chest card marked “Go to Jail.” One can roll doubles (both numbers on the dice are the same) three times in a row. There are also three ways that a player can get out of Jail Use a “Get out of Jail Free” card Pay $50 Roll doubles on any of the three turns after a player goes to Jail. We will examine the probabilities of the third item on each of the above lists. Probability of Going to Jail We will first look at the probability of going to Jail by rolling three doubles in a row.   There are six different rolls that are doubles (double 1, double 2, double 3, double 4, double 5 and double 6) out of a total of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. So on any turn, the probability of rolling a double is 6/36 = 1/6. Now each roll of the dice is independent. So the probability that any given turn will result in the rolling of doubles three times in a row is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/216.         This is approximately 0.46%. While this may seem like a small percentage, given the length of most Monopoly games, it is likely that this will happen at some point to someone during the game. Probability of Leaving Jail We now turn to the probability of leaving Jail by rolling doubles. This probability is slightly more difficult to calculate because there are different cases to consider: The probability that we roll doubles on the first roll is 1/6. The probability that we roll doubles on the second turn but not the first is (5/6) x (1/6) = 5/36. The probability that we roll doubles on the third turn but not the first or second is (5/6) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 25/216. So the probability of rolling doubles to get out of Jail is 1/6 + 5/36 + 25/216 = 91/216, or about 42%. We could calculate this probability in a different way. The complement of the event “roll doubles at least once over the next three turns” is “We don’t roll doubles at all over the next three turns.” Thus the probability of not rolling any doubles is (5/6) x (5/6) x (5/6) = 125/216. Since we have calculated the probability of the complement of the event that we want to find, we subtract this probability from 100%. We get the same probability of 1 – 125/216 = 91/216 that we obtained from the other method.  Probabilities of the Other Methods Probabilities for the other methods are difficult to calculate. They all involve the probability of landing on a particular space (or landing on a particular space and drawing a particular card). Finding the probability of landing on a certain space in Monopoly is actually quite difficult. This sort of problem can be dealt with by the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.
