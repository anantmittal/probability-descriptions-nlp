The Chances of Getting Pregnant Without Protection Many teenagers and adults make mistakes when it comes to rushing into a relationship or into bed with someone. Of course in the heat of the moment, it's entirely possible to forget about protection.  However, if you don't use birth control, it's very easy to fall pregnant or contract a disease or infection. The following information is written for anyone who has had unprotected intercourse and wants to know what the chances are of pregnancy.  These questions are answered in this article:  Can I get pregnant if the condom breaks?  What are the chances of getting pregnant after sex with a condom?  What is the most fertile time for a woman?  What are the symptoms of pregnancy?  How long can sperm live?  And remember, next time use contraception!   What Are the Chances I Am Pregnant? For every fertile woman who has unprotected sex, there is a 20% chance that she will get pregnant. What does this mean? For every 100 women who have unprotected sex for a month, 20 of them get pregnant .  Whenever you have penetrative sex or contact between male and female genitals, it is possible to become pregnant.  You can get pregnant the first time you have intercourse or at any time of your monthly cycle.  A man does not have to orgasm for the woman to fall pregnant.  Even if the sexual contact lasted only a few seconds there is a small chance of pregnancy.  The withdrawal method is not a method of birth control. Pre-ejaculate fluid (the clear stuff that comes out of a penis before ejaculation) can still make a woman pregnant.  There are millions of sperm in each male ejaculation, meaning there are millions of tiny chances of you falling pregnant.  That's the general information. For more specifics about whether you might be pregnant and what to look for, read on.   Can I Get Pregnant After Sex With a Condom? "A woman can definitely become pregnant after sex even if a condom is used, if the condom outright breaks, has a hole in it, or slips while the partner is exiting the vagina," says Dr. Tami Prince, a gynecologist at the Women's Health and Wellness Center in Marietta, Georgia. "Even the slightest opening in the condom that is invisible to the naked eye can allow for sperm to enter the vagina and migrate towards the Fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs. If a woman happens to be ovulating at the time, the risk of pregnancy is increased."  While the effectiveness of a condom is 85%, that means that out of 100 women who used a condom as birth control for a year, 15 of them may have become pregnant.  When a condom is not put on correctly, an air bubble between the latex and the penis can cause the condom to break or slide off. Be sure that you know how to put a condom on correctly. (For simple, not explicit, directions, watch the video below.)  Also, condoms can break! When this happens, the birth control method failed and you have had unprotected sex, which means you could become pregnant.   Can I Get Pregnant After Sex Without a Condom? Yes. Intercourse without a condom, or any other contraception, is unprotected sex. Depending on where you are in your cycle, there is about a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant from intercourse without a condom.   How to Put a Condom on Correctly (Not Explicit!)   Only Use Water- or Silcone-Based Lubricant With a Latex Condom Oil-based lubricants destroy latex and will cause the condom to break.   How Likely Is it I Will Get Pregnant? The following is a list of the kinds of sex that give you a reasonable chance of falling pregnant:  Unprotected penetrative sex (with or without orgasm).  Any contact between fresh sperm and the vagina.  When a condom breaks.  Using the withdrawal method.  Sex in any position, including missionary, doggy-style, and standing up.  When you have missed a birth control pill or taken them incorrectly (always follow the instructions.)    What's the Risk of Pregnancy From Sex With Contraception? The following is a list of the kinds of sex that give you have a small or close to no chance of falling pregnant: (remember, it is still possible to fall pregnant these ways.)  Right before or during your period.  Using a condom (.01% chance).  While on the birth control pill (.01% chance).  While using a condom and birth control pills ( very rare but does occasionally happen.)  While using any form of birth control such as Depo Provera injections.    Can I Get Pregnant After Oral or Anal Sex? No, you cannot  get pregnant from having oral sex with no direct genital-to-genital contact.  Also, you cannot get pregnant after using an item (such as a towel) that a man has used. Sperm dies very quickly when not in a warm, moist environment.   How Long Can Sperm Live After Sex? Sperm can live for 5-7 days inside the vagina and fallopian tubes, where conception takes place.   Effectiveness Rates of Birth Control   Method   Effectiveness Rate   Birth control pills   91%   Birth control implant   99%   Birth control patch   91%   Depo Provera birth control shot   94%   Birth control sponge   76-88%   Vaginal ring   91%   Breastfeeding   98%   Cervical cap   71-86%   Condom   85-90%   Diaphragm   88%   IUD   99%   Withdrawl (pull out method)   78%   Effectiveness rates show how many women, out of 100 who used that method for a year, did not get pregnant. For source, see below*.    When Can I Take the "Morning After" Emergency Contraception Pill? There is a special morning after pill (also known as the "Plan B" pill) that you can take up to five days after having sex, though it is most effective within the first 72 hours. The sooner you use it, the more chance that you won't have an unwanted pregnancy.  "There are no medical contraindications for Plan B use the way there may be for other hormonal birth control options," says Dr. Prince. "That means even if a woman has a medical condition which would increase her risk for adverse effects if a hormonal birth control option is used long-term, the same does not hold true for Plan B as it is a one-time use versus long-term use."  The pill works by causing an early abortion if you are pregnant. It is usually more expensive than birth control tablets that are taken before sex.   When Am I Most Fertile? A woman is most fertile 7-14 days after her period ends. This is called ovulation.  A woman is least fertile just before her period begins.  Every woman ovulates at different times and has a different length cycle. This means that even if you have sex when you are least fertile, chances are you may still fall pregnant.    How Can I Avoid Getting Pregnant Without Using a Condom? Fertility awareness is a birth control method. It is also called the rhythm method. This method involves very carefully tracking your cycle so that you know exactly when you are fertile. If you do not use birth control and don't want to get pregnant, then you should avoid intercourse during that fertile period.  "This method requires precise knowledge of the actual day of ovulation," says Dr. Prince. "Since this day can vary month to month, a woman needs to recognize other signs of ovulation such as a change in the cervical mucus and rise in body temperature for the rhythm method to be effective."  There are different ways to track your cycle and identify your fertile period.  Taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed. A woman's body temperature rises when she ovulates.  Checking cervical mucus. The discharge that comes out of your vagina changes during your cycle. Right before and during ovulation, there is usually more discharge and it is more slippery.  Tracking your period on a calendar, including the number of days for each period, when they start and when they end. After keeping track for six months, you can identify your fertile period by selecting the shortest of the six cycles you have recorded. Subtract 18 from its total number of days. Now count that number ahead for your current cycle and mark that day with an X. That is your first fertile day.    How to Know for Sure Whether You Are Pregnant There is only one way to conclusively tell if you are pregnant. That is to take a pregnancy test (or have your doctor perform a pregnancy test.)  Most pregnancy tests can be taken by two weeks after having sexual intercourse.  Pregnancy tests work by monitoring the HCG in your body. This is a pregnancy hormone that is only present when you are pregnant. For this reason, if you tested positive, it's fairly certain you are pregnant. If you tested negative, you may still be pregnant if you tested too early or at the wrong time of day, because the concentration of HCG increases slowly as the pregnancy develops.  Most tests work in such a way that either one or two lines or dots should appear. The first line is a control to make sure the test is working and the second line or dot indicates pregnancy.  If you are testing early it's advisable to take the test first thing in the morning when levels of HCG in the urine are more concentrated. You can take the test at any time of day but in early pregnancy, this may result in a false negative.   Symptoms of Pregnancy If you think you may be pregnant, you may soon be experiencing some pregnancy symptoms. However, most pregnancy symptoms don't start until between 3-9 weeks  after you fall pregnant. Some women never experience symptoms at all.  Symptoms can include:  A missed period.  Light spotting.  Nausea.  Swollen, veiny, or tender breasts.  A metallic taste in the mouth.  Weight gain.  Extreme tiredness.  Changes in appetite.  Craving or aversion to food.  Stuffy nose.  Remember though: Nearly all these symptoms can also be linked to your menstrual cycle.   Can I Still Get an STD if We Used a Condom? Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, are spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. There is no guaranteed way to prevent STDs during sexual activity.  For example, condom use may not protect against Herpes infection for several reasons. One is that herpetic lesions may not just be on the penis, which is the only part of the genitalia that the condom covers. Lesions may be anywhere on the male or female genitalia and skin. Once skin-to-skin contact is made, transmission of herpes is possible.  Also, a person does not need to have lesions in order to spread herpes. This is called "asymptomatic shedding." Since most people are unaware that they have herpes as they have not had any symptoms such as lesions, pain, or burning, asymptomatic shedding is the most common way herpetic transmission occurs.  Condoms also do not also prevent HIV. This is because most people don’t use condoms during oral sex, so HIV can still be transmitted that way.  Other STDs are a cause for concern. For example, hepatitis B can cause liver disease and HPV can lead to certain types of cancer.  Chlamydia, however, is very common and easy to treat. The same is true for gonorrhea.   Why You Should Take a Pregnancy Test If you decide that not getting a pregnancy test will make the problem go away, think again.  If you are pregnant, the further you are along the higher the chance that untreated complications (such as miscarriage or pregnancy-related symptoms) could put your health at risk.  If you are pregnant and wish to carry it to term, you need to begin taking pregnancy vitamins and eating correctly. Otherwise, the baby has a higher chance of a disability such as spina bifida .  If you've contracted an STD or STI (sexually transmitted infection) from the unprotected sex, chances are that you need treatment. Not getting treated could harm the baby and you.    What to Do About an Unwanted Pregnancy You need to see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor will confirm the pregnancy results and offer advice about options.  If a doctor isn't the best option for you, talk to a trusted friend. Support and information are available to help you decide your next steps.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

Score! So as you head back to your place and things get heated, there’s no shot you’re killing the mood with a condom ...right?       Bad idea. Terrible idea. In fact, that logic is so flawed we’re going to go ahead and counter it with the ultimate mood killer: In the first year of a baby’s life—between doctor visits, clothing, food, and everything else, a parent can expect to spend more than $10,000.

The mistake: You think having sex standing up prevents pregnancy  The potential damage: We couldn’t believe that nearly 1 in 5 of men buy into this, but according to a 2010 study , it's true. Yikes. “The law of gravity is not a contraceptive,” says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., the co-director of The Center for Sexual Health Promotion. That’s a seemingly obvious assessment, right? Use it.  2. The mistake: You blindly grab some lube  The potential damage: Always, always, always check what your lube is made out of—otherwise, that condom might do jack. “Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants like mineral oil or massage lotion can destroy condoms, making them more likely to break,” says sexologist and sexuality educator Megan Andelloux .  3. The mistake: Your hands are sweaty, so one of you tears the condom package with your teeth  The potential damage: Using items like knives or scissors—even your teeth—to open a wrapper will make it very easy to mistakenly poke a hole in the condom. (In one study , dudes who did so were about three times more likely to encounter breakage.) Think about it—do you really want sharp objects coming anywhere near the super-thin barrier that stands between you and fatherhood?

The mistake: You put the condom on—but don’t leave any space in the tip  The potential damage: If you covered up a faucet with your hand and turned it on full blast, where would the water go? See what we’re sayin’? It’s not rocket science. So leave approximately half an inch at the top of the condom to properly “catch” your sperm, says Herbenick; without this wiggle room, you’re risking breakage.  5. The mistake: You don’t use a condom because she’s on the pill  The potential damage: If you’re in a relationship, you should trust that she’s true to her word. But for a one-night stand? It’s not worth the risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , birth control pills are between 91-99% effective in preventing pregnancy—but the pill plus a condom gives you close-to-perfect protection. Your call.  6. The mistake: You were wasted and couldn’t find a condom...so you didn’t use one  The potential damage: Sure, it’s an understandably awkward situation if you’re about to “get it in” and can’t figure out where the hell you put the condom. But is it more awkward than becoming a daddy if you’re not ready for a kid? Get off your ass and search a little harder, or walk to the store and pick up an extra pack. According to the World Health Organization , with perfect use, condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time. That’s pretty damn good.          Relationships   Sex positions that won't get her off    Steer clear of these 4 sex positions that won't get her off.      7. The mistake: You’ve had the same condom hanging out in your wallet forever  The potential damage: Using a condom that hasn’t been properly stored might get you into a situation worse than the sexual slump you just endured. According to Herbenick, extreme heat or cold can damage the latex used in condoms, so the best spot for stashing them is a cool, dark, dry place—like in your nightstand—or a small, hard case (think: one made for business cards). And if you’re really trying to be a douche about the whole thing, there's alwasy this $200 Swarovski crystal condom compact .  8. The mistake: You’re not putting lube inside the condom  The potential damage: Those marathon sex sessions you’ve been having (nice work, bro) are bound to wear down the condom, making it dry and prone to ripping. “Always use lube inside the condom. It prevents breakage and, plus, it actually feels so much better for the condom-wearer,” says Andelloux. Remember: Check the type of lube before you apply, and just use a drop—too much can make the condom slip off.  9. The mistake: You take the condom off before the sex is over  The potential damage: If you're patting yourself on the back for using a condom in the first place...don't. Taking a condom off too early on into sex "can directly compromise the efficacy of condom use," according to a recent study from The Journal of Sexual Health . But you know that, silly! So if you play by the rules and keep that sucker on the entire time, it's 98% certain ( see no. 6 ) you won't have to worry about becoming a daddy. (Just be sure you hold the base of the condom during withdrawal to make sure it doesn't slip off or leak you-know-what.)          Relationships   How much sex is too much?    Can you get too much of a good thing? Doctors weigh in.       10. The mistake: You don’t need condoms—you’re a “pull-out pro”  The potential damage: You might think you have impeccable timing, but even if you do pull out in time, it’s still possible to get her pregnant. How? According to Planned Parenthood , your pre-ejaculate can pick up enough sperm left in your pipes from your last ejaculation to fertilize an egg. Whoa. Now, urinating between ejaculations might help, but as they say, it’s always safer to wrap it before you tap it—and the risk-taking for your non -sexual adventures.

Myths  This Day in History  Announcements  Most Popular    Surprise  Podcasts   The BrainFood Show    Quick Facts  Wise Book of Whys  Contact           The “Pull and Pray” Method Works About as Well as a Condom for Preventing Pregnancy    December 21, 2010    Daven Hiskey    44 comments     Today I found out that the “Pull and Pray” method statistically is just about as effective as condoms for preventing pregnancy.  Indeed, according to Dr. John Guillebaud in his book Contraception: Your Questions Answered , some of the lowest birth rates in history pop up around cultures whose primary method of contraception is the pull and pray method.  This method, also known as “Coitus Interruptus” or the “withdrawal method”, was once one of the most popular methods of preventing pregnancy, but in recent times has been cast aside in many cultures.  It turns out though, as long as you get the “pull” part right, there really isn’t much praying necessary.  According to research done in 2008 at the Guttmacher Institute in New York, the withdrawal method, when executed perfectly, is 96% effective for preventing pregnancy.  For comparison, using a condom, when done perfectly, is 98% effective and oral contraception has a “perfect use” rate of 99.7% effective.   Now this is when all three methods are done “perfectly”, so what about in actual practice with everyday people?  The pull and pray method is roughly 82% effective while using a condom is roughly 83% effective, so you are only getting a 1% improvement for your money and effort.  The pill, in contrast, does offer a much better “actual use” rate of about 96%.     So what gives?  Why is withdrawal working just as well as condoms?  It turns out that, according to recent studies, pre-ejaculate almost never contains any sperm.  The few times sperm did show up in the studies, they tended to be immobile and clumped together, so basically dead or completely incapable of impregnating anything.  This is because the only way sperm can get into the pre-ejaculate is if it was already in the urethra from a previous ejaculation, due to the fact that the Cowper’s gland contains no sperm.  Thus, as long as the man has either peed since the last time he ejaculated or it has simply been a while since that time, which probably means he’s peed at some point anyways,  the withdrawal method is extremely effective as a birth control method.  It’s also arguably easier to execute this method “perfectly”, achieving closer to the 96% effective rate, than it is with condoms, with the failure rate of condoms typically coming from the condom breaking.  The primary cause of failure with the pull and pray method lies in the cases where the person executes the praying part perfectly, after the fact, but didn’t manage the “pull” part of the method, which is of course the most important bit; though on failure of that, the praying probably doesn’t hurt. 😉  Bonus Facts:   Worldwide about 3% of couples rely on the withdrawal method as their primary means of contraception, though almost 52% of women report that they have used the withdrawal method at some point in their lives and among the surveyed 21% said they had used this withdrawal method in the last month.  Previous to the Roman Empire, evidence suggests that the withdrawal method was the primary form of contraception used.  This fell out of popularity with the Romans who favored other methods available at the time, most of which have been lost to history.  After the fall of the Roman Empire around the 400s, all methods of contraception fell out of practice in the western world due to Christianity who saw it as sinful.  Around the 1800s, however, the withdrawal method saw a huge resurgence and was the primary form of contraception in the world until methods such as the condom and the pill were introduced in the 20th century.  The oldest documented use of the withdrawal method to avoid pregnancy was the story of Onan in the Torah, believed to have been written around 2500 years ago.

Also, pulling after a squirt or two doesn’t do the trick either. Just sayin’.    Reply          Ruby   February 24, 2010							4:33 pm      Let’s not forget – pull & pray doesn’t work for gonaherpahivasyphilitis.  Condoms block other things than sperm.    Reply        Robby   May 13, 2015							5:26 am      Unless they have….holes….tear….slip off. Herpes isn’t blocked by condoms, either. Herpes is transmitted by skin contact, not only by penis-to-vagina. Also, HPV (warts) are not reliably blocked by condoms for the same reason. Warts on other parts, like fingers, that are relatively benign and easy to get rid of can really raise hell on the genitals and in the vagina and urethra. Some of the worst strains of HPV do not make visible wart bumps but make cysts buried in the flesh, so a visual snatch inspection it may not catch.    Reply          unforgiven247   February 24, 2010							9:28 pm      Got a question… I slept with two different men…one I used the pull and pray method and the other there was nothing to stop me from getting pregnant.  I’m not sure which one is closer to my conception date because they were unforgivenably close together… So is this method really worth not worrying about or is it likely I have no clue who my babies dad is?    Reply        Robby   May 13, 2015							5:37 am      A blood test can eliminate a possible dad but to prove a dad, a DNA test is required. At your expense, since you’re the accuser/plaintiff. Just curious: Why do you care? Do they both want to acknowledge the baby? Marry you? If not, consider leaving them alone. If you were willing to have sex with a man to whom you were not married, be a big girl and accept the consequence of your choices. [I realize the comment to which I am replying was 5 years ago.]    Reply        Samantha   July 13, 2015							3:50 pm      Um, Robby… It sounds like both men in this situation were also willing to have sex with a woman to whom they were not married so why on earth would the father not be equally responsible for the consequences? It’s fine if you want to consider premarital sex an irresponsible choice… but it is a choice made by two people. If you think that the woman should accept the consequences of that choice than logic dictates that so should the man. To suggest otherwise is pure, unadulterated misogyny. Also, did you ever think it might be a good idea to know who the father is for genetic purposes in terms of what the child could inherit and also down the road the child might like to know and have a right to know who it’s biological father is?    Reply        John   April 26, 2016							8:34 am      Although yes, the males assumed the exact risk when they decided to have unprotected coitus, it was the female who decided to – on her own accord mind you, to sleep with two men unprotected within a short time period. no one told her to go around screwing all types of guys raw. that’s her own fault. she should be a big girl and put on her big girl pants. hopefully if she dodged a bullet and nothing was conceived, she should really think about her rather reckless behavior. otherwise she’s going to go down this road again. i seriously doubt both guys were cool with sleeping with the same girl back to back.    Reply              Luis   March 3, 2010							6:01 pm      My health book showed the withdrawl method was 80% reliable. I’m surprised only 3% of people said they rely on it. My wife and I have used the withdrawl method for about 8 years. One month we decided to try to have a baby and were successful. I had thoughts that we may have trouble getting pregnant because there were no accidental babys over all those years, but getting pregnant after the first try proved that wrong.    Reply         OnTehOtherSide   June 30, 2010							3:36 pm      Teh key word is execution. If you don’t pull out in time, you pay… for 18 yrs and that is the hardest part.

Yeah, but “almost never” is not “never.” Why would you take that chance?  Shame on you for giving people faulty information.  Also, wouldn’t you be a little worried about STIs?    Reply        Daven   December 22, 2010							12:21 pm      @bullshit: “almost never is not never”:  It helps to read the next sentence before commenting: “The few times sperm did show up in the studies, they tended to be immobile and clumped together, so basically dead or completely incapable of impregnating anything.”  “Shame on you for giving people faulty information”: Yep, who’s ever heard of scientifically gathered information being accurate anyways?  Personally, I like to only rely on completely subjective data that I heard from a guy I know who knows a guy who one time thought something the opposite of what the scientific data showed.  “Also, wouldn’t you be a little worried about STI’s?”: This article wasn’t about sexually transmitted diseases, unless you consider kids to be a sexually transmitted disease, which my brother constantly tells me is the case. 😉  It was simply an article pointing out the interesting fact that the pull and pray method, when done properly, is actually a pretty effective method of birth control, which I found fascinating and thought other people might as well.  In the coming zombie apocalypse, when condoms and other such methods of contraception aren’t readily available, this will be good information to know. 😉    Reply        Sheogorath   April 29, 2015							1:43 pm      Agreed. Pregnancy is a sexually transmitted condition , not a disease.    Reply           Lydia   December 29, 2010							8:21 pm      My story is very similar to Luis’. My boyfriend and I would always use the withdrawal method when we were dating – we knew each other to be free of any diseases, and we trusted one another to stay an help if we DID end up with a pregnancy. After many years of sex that way, we ended up married, and wanting a baby. Well, after so many years of never having gotten pregnant without any use of commercial contraceptive, we were relatively sure one of us could easily just be incapable of fertility. Lo and behold, years after our first attempt, our Kara is starting third grade and our second is on its way. Interestingly, all the couples I know who have had trouble conceiving have all relied on birth control pills before deciding to try for a baby. I’d like to see a study performed on any possible adverse side effects of contraceptive pills.    Reply       Stu8080   December 30, 2010							11:41 am      Everyone seems to have overlooked the fact that the hard bit is the pull… The major caveat is that its only “when executed perfectly”.  If your sex is so mechanical that you are constantly evaluating when that point is then, personally, i think that becoming a parent is going to be a blessing to you, you need to find a girl who wants to do it with you more than once!  Seriously though, this is bad advice. If you ever had to apologise for not waiting for her, then you know you will have to apologise for not pulling out in time.    Reply        CaptButtNakid   September 26, 2013							9:43 am      There’s nothing ‘mechanical’ about realizing you are on the proverbial point of no-return! If you cannot tell when you’re about to let loose, then you should be forbidden from sex and practice masturbation until you get a clue.  My GF-who-became-wife and I alternated condoms, pills AND pull and pray in time together, the only failure came when she deliberately went off the pill without telling me one time. The next child was on purpose, after a long period of relying on pullout. The Method works great, as long as you, the man, have enough control over your dick.

Reply       Reki   June 9, 2011							8:41 pm      Wow, really? As it turns out, condoms do not break as often as they say they do when used correctly. You kept that one in your wallet for a month? Throw it away. That one will most likely break. FRESH or NEW condoms don’t break easily, despite what they tell you.  1) If they are too old, they will break. Its YOUR fault. 2) If you don’t use enough lube, or don’t stop when you need more, they will break. It’s YOUR fault. 3) If they are not rolled on right or pulled out right after, they can leak. It’s YOUR fault. 4) If you put your penis back in after taking off the condom, why even wear one to begin with?  In other words, condoms work. It’s the idiots that don’t know how to use them that don’t.    Reply       Treat Keratosis Pilaris   July 1, 2011							7:47 am      It also provides no protection against STDs. Condoms still win.

Reply        Pro-withdrawl method   January 28, 2013							8:29 pm      I dated a girl for one year and eight months having sex on a regular basis using only the pullout method and only doing it correctly (pulling out in time and peeing after each ejaculation before going at it again).  To the one that speculated that sex done this way would be mechanical because you’re too focused on  waiting for the right time to pull out…. I can say its not like that for me at all. Usually I’m trying to make my partner happy, or myself if she’s finished already, and sometimes that doesn’t even happen…. but when it does you know a bit ahead of time, you don’t need to wait or pay that much attention to know when the pleasure gets to that point. I’ve had a 100% success rate but I know my body very well and have practiced self control.  Basicly if you’ve never masturbated before… don’t try this… if you aren’t very good at masturbating…. don’t try this… If you’re drunk, or under any influence that slows your reaction time…. don’t try this…  But if you’re good at it and have self control, its a viable solution.

If the test doesn’t do that (either guy could be), a DNA test can tell 100% if negative and 99% if it shows positive. This assumes you can find either of them once they find out you’re preg!  OnTehOtherSide, an unkind remark. At least she wasn’t having the baby killed.  Luis, “… getting pregnant after the first try proved that wrong.” Not really. All it really proves is that no tadpoles met Miss Ova successfully until one did.  Condoms reduce but do not eliminate the possibility of STIs. Per sex act. However, their availability does encourage more sex acts, so their availability increases the incidence of STIs and pregnancies in a population. If having condoms available makes no difference to you how often you have sex, that is, you would have as much sex if no condoms were available,  condoms will reduce the likelihood of STIs and, if you would use no other contraception, pregnancy.  Planned Parenthood has come under fire (again!) for distributing millions of defective condoms (holes, break easily). They get more abortion business that way. Like they do, not reporting suspected statutory rape when underage girls come in for abortions. The rapist (legally speaking if not forcible) is then free to generate more abortion business with the same girl. And others.    Reply       RTFA   January 2, 2012							11:38 pm      All discussion on STDs are irrelevant.  The topic is about preventing pregnancy.  Not preventing STDs or safe sex.    Reply       Neville   March 26, 2013							12:25 am      My partner and I have been together for close to 3 months. From the first time we had sex (we were both tested first and are 100% clean), we’ve soly relied on using the pullout method. We both feel the withdrawal method is a great method of birth control as it’s 100% natural without any hormones involved and it’s cumfortable too. We have not had any pregnancy scares to date as I know my body very well and know when to pullout & spurt my babybatter elsewhere lol 😉 After each ejaculation, I always urinate so that any residual sperm left in my urethra is flushed out before going for Round Two. It also helps to wash your appendage with soap just to be safe afterwards as well 😉  I would only recommend this form of birth control in monogamous relationships (NOT Casual relationships) as it does not protect against any STI’s.    Reply       Emily   July 20, 2013							10:19 am      My partner and I have used the pull out method for 2 years successfully. I tried the pill a couple of times for a short while and the side effects were horrible and they messed my system up for several weeks afterwards. In my experience, the pull out method is natural, there are no nasty side effects that you get from the pill (the pill reduced my sex drive, gave me acne, made me moody, made me feel sick all the time and gave me daily headaches and when i discontinued i bled for about a month every day each time and i had no idea when i was ovulating or when my period would come). While using the pull out method, i must add that i make sure i’m aware of when i am ovulating and when i am likely to be most fertile. During these days we have oral sex instead. I wish GPs would educated people more about the pull out method rather than dismiss it completely.    Reply       Me   September 10, 2013							12:31 pm      My then girlfriend/finance and I started using the pull out method from the moment we became engaged. We felt it was the best method for us. Add to that the fact that my girlfriend…now my wife of more than 30 years…could somewhat accurately predict her ovulation cycle we were successful for nearly 4 years.  After our wedding we still used withdrawl and did not get pregnant for 3 years. We now have 4 children.    Reply        Alli3   April 18, 2014							8:11 am      Matt, LMAO.

Reply       Experienced   May 6, 2014							1:14 am      My fiance and I have been using this method since we started dating (Almost 6 years). We’ll go at it, he’ll pull out, ejaculate, pee, then we’ll go at it again. We go a few rounds. I have yet to become pregnant. I’ve always wondered if I was infertile, but based on this I hope I’m not. Guess we won’t find out until we start trying for a baby.    Reply        Experienced   May 6, 2014							1:17 am      By the way I’m not on the pill or any other type of contraception, sometimes we’ll use condoms, but we both prefer the pullout method. It just feels better.    Reply         John   April 26, 2016							8:49 am      I’m in my 30’s and personally have been with circa 100 women. I know that’s utterly disgraceful and all, but hear me out. I exclusively used the pull out method and never once did i get any of them pregnant. there were however, two instances when a condom was being used and broke from the prolonged fiction. in those two situations we simply went to the local pharmacy and purchased a “plan B” morning after pill, which is good for up to 72 hours I believe. It wasn’t the cheapest thing in the world to buy, but considering the alternative, it was a no-brainer. For a long time I thought that maybe I might be sterile since the odds of no one getting pregnant to me seemed pretty astronomical. But in fact, it turns out that I was always disciplined when it came to pulling out prior to climax. I know for a fact I am indeed not sterile since later on after years of dating a special girl, we decided to try for a baby. I’m not entirely if it was due to her being underweight at the time (85lbs, 5’3″), but it took us close to 6 whole months to finally conceive. and that was with daily deliberate baby-making coitus (creampie, if you want it to call it that.)

Who We Are  About               Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you?

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

What Are The Success Rates Of Having A Tubal Ligation Successfully Reversed? »               What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant without Ejaculation?   Health and Well-Being  No comments    It is absolutely possible to become pregnant even if a man does not ejaculate, or does not ejaculate during intercourse.  The most reliable methods of birth control involve the use of either a contraceptive medication, such as birth control pills, or a barrier, such as a condom.  It is possible for pre-seminal fluid (sometimes called precum) to have sperm in it.  While pre-seminal fluid is not produced with sperm in it, if there is sperm in the man’s urethra from a previous ejaculation, the pre-seminal fluid may pick up the sperm and carry it along.  If a man urinates after a previous ejaculation but before having sex, it is much less likely that his pre-seminal fluid will have sperm in it.  There are other factors that make “pulling out” a higher risk for becoming pregnant.  Trying to avoid getting pregnant without ejaculation relies on the man’s ability to know his own body.  He has to be able to tell right away when he is about to ejaculate so that he can withdrawal in time.  In addition, using this method for birth control relies on the man’s self-control;  he has to be able to stop himself at the very height of passion to make sure that he does not ejaculate.     Using this practice of “pulling out” as a form of birth control is not entirely reliable.  Success rates run anywhere from 73 to 96% effectiveness.  In contrast, the birth control pill is more than 99% effective, and the condom, when used correctly, is around 99% effective.  In general, the withdrawal method is not always the best method of birth control.  If barriers, such as condoms, are not an option, and medication, such as the birth control pill, is not an option, you might consider a combination of withdrawal and the rhythm method.  The rhythm method is based on the idea that you won’t have sex when you are fertile.  This works best for women who have a regular cycle, and perfectly practice the rhythm method.  This method does require constant vigilance, and cooperation of your partner.  For religious and other reasons, this is the preferred birth control method for many women.  Rhythm, like withdrawal, can be very effective.  However, if a woman doesn’t have a menstrual cycle that is constant and predictable, the chances of becoming pregnant increase.  The chances of becoming pregnant also increase dramatically if the partners don’t strictly follow the calendar.

The Chances of Getting Pregnant Without Protection Many teenagers and adults make mistakes when it comes to rushing into a relationship or into bed with someone. Of course in the heat of the moment, it's entirely possible to forget about protection.  However, if you don't use birth control, it's very easy to fall pregnant or contract a disease or infection. The following information is written for anyone who has had unprotected intercourse and wants to know what the chances are of pregnancy.  These questions are answered in this article:  Can I get pregnant if the condom breaks?  What are the chances of getting pregnant after sex with a condom?  What is the most fertile time for a woman?  What are the symptoms of pregnancy?  How long can sperm live?  And remember, next time use contraception!   What Are the Chances I Am Pregnant? For every fertile woman who has unprotected sex, there is a 20% chance that she will get pregnant. What does this mean? For every 100 women who have unprotected sex for a month, 20 of them get pregnant .  Whenever you have penetrative sex or contact between male and female genitals, it is possible to become pregnant.  You can get pregnant the first time you have intercourse or at any time of your monthly cycle.  A man does not have to orgasm for the woman to fall pregnant.  Even if the sexual contact lasted only a few seconds there is a small chance of pregnancy.  The withdrawal method is not a method of birth control. Pre-ejaculate fluid (the clear stuff that comes out of a penis before ejaculation) can still make a woman pregnant.  There are millions of sperm in each male ejaculation, meaning there are millions of tiny chances of you falling pregnant.  That's the general information. For more specifics about whether you might be pregnant and what to look for, read on.   Can I Get Pregnant After Sex With a Condom? "A woman can definitely become pregnant after sex even if a condom is used, if the condom outright breaks, has a hole in it, or slips while the partner is exiting the vagina," says Dr. Tami Prince, a gynecologist at the Women's Health and Wellness Center in Marietta, Georgia. "Even the slightest opening in the condom that is invisible to the naked eye can allow for sperm to enter the vagina and migrate towards the Fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs. If a woman happens to be ovulating at the time, the risk of pregnancy is increased."  While the effectiveness of a condom is 85%, that means that out of 100 women who used a condom as birth control for a year, 15 of them may have become pregnant.  When a condom is not put on correctly, an air bubble between the latex and the penis can cause the condom to break or slide off. Be sure that you know how to put a condom on correctly. (For simple, not explicit, directions, watch the video below.)  Also, condoms can break! When this happens, the birth control method failed and you have had unprotected sex, which means you could become pregnant.   Can I Get Pregnant After Sex Without a Condom? Yes. Intercourse without a condom, or any other contraception, is unprotected sex. Depending on where you are in your cycle, there is about a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant from intercourse without a condom.   How to Put a Condom on Correctly (Not Explicit!)   Only Use Water- or Silcone-Based Lubricant With a Latex Condom Oil-based lubricants destroy latex and will cause the condom to break.   How Likely Is it I Will Get Pregnant? The following is a list of the kinds of sex that give you a reasonable chance of falling pregnant:  Unprotected penetrative sex (with or without orgasm).  Any contact between fresh sperm and the vagina.  When a condom breaks.  Using the withdrawal method.  Sex in any position, including missionary, doggy-style, and standing up.  When you have missed a birth control pill or taken them incorrectly (always follow the instructions.)    What's the Risk of Pregnancy From Sex With Contraception? The following is a list of the kinds of sex that give you have a small or close to no chance of falling pregnant: (remember, it is still possible to fall pregnant these ways.)  Right before or during your period.  Using a condom (.01% chance).  While on the birth control pill (.01% chance).  While using a condom and birth control pills ( very rare but does occasionally happen.)  While using any form of birth control such as Depo Provera injections.    Can I Get Pregnant After Oral or Anal Sex? No, you cannot  get pregnant from having oral sex with no direct genital-to-genital contact.  Also, you cannot get pregnant after using an item (such as a towel) that a man has used. Sperm dies very quickly when not in a warm, moist environment.   How Long Can Sperm Live After Sex? Sperm can live for 5-7 days inside the vagina and fallopian tubes, where conception takes place.

For source, see below*.    When Can I Take the "Morning After" Emergency Contraception Pill? There is a special morning after pill (also known as the "Plan B" pill) that you can take up to five days after having sex, though it is most effective within the first 72 hours. The sooner you use it, the more chance that you won't have an unwanted pregnancy.  "There are no medical contraindications for Plan B use the way there may be for other hormonal birth control options," says Dr. Prince. "That means even if a woman has a medical condition which would increase her risk for adverse effects if a hormonal birth control option is used long-term, the same does not hold true for Plan B as it is a one-time use versus long-term use."  The pill works by causing an early abortion if you are pregnant. It is usually more expensive than birth control tablets that are taken before sex.   When Am I Most Fertile? A woman is most fertile 7-14 days after her period ends. This is called ovulation.  A woman is least fertile just before her period begins.  Every woman ovulates at different times and has a different length cycle. This means that even if you have sex when you are least fertile, chances are you may still fall pregnant.    How Can I Avoid Getting Pregnant Without Using a Condom? Fertility awareness is a birth control method. It is also called the rhythm method. This method involves very carefully tracking your cycle so that you know exactly when you are fertile. If you do not use birth control and don't want to get pregnant, then you should avoid intercourse during that fertile period.  "This method requires precise knowledge of the actual day of ovulation," says Dr. Prince. "Since this day can vary month to month, a woman needs to recognize other signs of ovulation such as a change in the cervical mucus and rise in body temperature for the rhythm method to be effective."  There are different ways to track your cycle and identify your fertile period.  Taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed. A woman's body temperature rises when she ovulates.  Checking cervical mucus. The discharge that comes out of your vagina changes during your cycle. Right before and during ovulation, there is usually more discharge and it is more slippery.  Tracking your period on a calendar, including the number of days for each period, when they start and when they end. After keeping track for six months, you can identify your fertile period by selecting the shortest of the six cycles you have recorded. Subtract 18 from its total number of days. Now count that number ahead for your current cycle and mark that day with an X. That is your first fertile day.    How to Know for Sure Whether You Are Pregnant There is only one way to conclusively tell if you are pregnant. That is to take a pregnancy test (or have your doctor perform a pregnancy test.)  Most pregnancy tests can be taken by two weeks after having sexual intercourse.  Pregnancy tests work by monitoring the HCG in your body. This is a pregnancy hormone that is only present when you are pregnant. For this reason, if you tested positive, it's fairly certain you are pregnant. If you tested negative, you may still be pregnant if you tested too early or at the wrong time of day, because the concentration of HCG increases slowly as the pregnancy develops.  Most tests work in such a way that either one or two lines or dots should appear. The first line is a control to make sure the test is working and the second line or dot indicates pregnancy.  If you are testing early it's advisable to take the test first thing in the morning when levels of HCG in the urine are more concentrated. You can take the test at any time of day but in early pregnancy, this may result in a false negative.   Symptoms of Pregnancy If you think you may be pregnant, you may soon be experiencing some pregnancy symptoms. However, most pregnancy symptoms don't start until between 3-9 weeks  after you fall pregnant. Some women never experience symptoms at all.  Symptoms can include:  A missed period.  Light spotting.  Nausea.  Swollen, veiny, or tender breasts.  A metallic taste in the mouth.  Weight gain.  Extreme tiredness.  Changes in appetite.  Craving or aversion to food.  Stuffy nose.  Remember though: Nearly all these symptoms can also be linked to your menstrual cycle.   Can I Still Get an STD if We Used a Condom? Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, are spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. There is no guaranteed way to prevent STDs during sexual activity.  For example, condom use may not protect against Herpes infection for several reasons. One is that herpetic lesions may not just be on the penis, which is the only part of the genitalia that the condom covers. Lesions may be anywhere on the male or female genitalia and skin. Once skin-to-skin contact is made, transmission of herpes is possible.  Also, a person does not need to have lesions in order to spread herpes. This is called "asymptomatic shedding." Since most people are unaware that they have herpes as they have not had any symptoms such as lesions, pain, or burning, asymptomatic shedding is the most common way herpetic transmission occurs.  Condoms also do not also prevent HIV. This is because most people don’t use condoms during oral sex, so HIV can still be transmitted that way.  Other STDs are a cause for concern. For example, hepatitis B can cause liver disease and HPV can lead to certain types of cancer.  Chlamydia, however, is very common and easy to treat. The same is true for gonorrhea.   Why You Should Take a Pregnancy Test If you decide that not getting a pregnancy test will make the problem go away, think again.  If you are pregnant, the further you are along the higher the chance that untreated complications (such as miscarriage or pregnancy-related symptoms) could put your health at risk.  If you are pregnant and wish to carry it to term, you need to begin taking pregnancy vitamins and eating correctly. Otherwise, the baby has a higher chance of a disability such as spina bifida .  If you've contracted an STD or STI (sexually transmitted infection) from the unprotected sex, chances are that you need treatment. Not getting treated could harm the baby and you.    What to Do About an Unwanted Pregnancy You need to see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor will confirm the pregnancy results and offer advice about options.  If a doctor isn't the best option for you, talk to a trusted friend. Support and information are available to help you decide your next steps.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

Shutterstock          Share    Tweet       Print    +/-    Comments       You’re about six beers deep and finally—after several overpriced dinners and cocktails —you’ve convinced a super hot chick that you’re the all-around awesome guy she initially hoped you'd be. Score! So as you head back to your place and things get heated, there’s no shot you’re killing the mood with a condom ...right?       Bad idea. Terrible idea. In fact, that logic is so flawed we’re going to go ahead and counter it with the ultimate mood killer: In the first year of a baby’s life—between doctor visits, clothing, food, and everything else, a parent can expect to spend more than $10,000. (Yeah. Let that sink in.)         So unless you’re ready to trade beer for baby formula, read this—our expansive guide to making sure you don’t knock her up. Because even if you play it safe most of the time, you’re probably screwing up in ways you didn’t even know were possible. And like your old man always said, it only takes one mistake.          Sexual health   Sex myths she believes    These need to be set straight—STAT.      1. The mistake: You think having sex standing up prevents pregnancy  The potential damage: We couldn’t believe that nearly 1 in 5 of men buy into this, but according to a 2010 study , it's true. Yikes. “The law of gravity is not a contraceptive,” says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., the co-director of The Center for Sexual Health Promotion. That’s a seemingly obvious assessment, right? Use it.  2. The mistake: You blindly grab some lube  The potential damage: Always, always, always check what your lube is made out of—otherwise, that condom might do jack. “Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants like mineral oil or massage lotion can destroy condoms, making them more likely to break,” says sexologist and sexuality educator Megan Andelloux .  3. The mistake: Your hands are sweaty, so one of you tears the condom package with your teeth  The potential damage: Using items like knives or scissors—even your teeth—to open a wrapper will make it very easy to mistakenly poke a hole in the condom. (In one study , dudes who did so were about three times more likely to encounter breakage.) Think about it—do you really want sharp objects coming anywhere near the super-thin barrier that stands between you and fatherhood?          Relationships   How to live with your girlfriend    13 tips to keep the sex hot, independence intact, and love alive.      4. The mistake: You put the condom on—but don’t leave any space in the tip  The potential damage: If you covered up a faucet with your hand and turned it on full blast, where would the water go? See what we’re sayin’? It’s not rocket science. So leave approximately half an inch at the top of the condom to properly “catch” your sperm, says Herbenick; without this wiggle room, you’re risking breakage.  5. The mistake: You don’t use a condom because she’s on the pill  The potential damage: If you’re in a relationship, you should trust that she’s true to her word. But for a one-night stand? It’s not worth the risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , birth control pills are between 91-99% effective in preventing pregnancy—but the pill plus a condom gives you close-to-perfect protection. Your call.  6. The mistake: You were wasted and couldn’t find a condom...so you didn’t use one  The potential damage: Sure, it’s an understandably awkward situation if you’re about to “get it in” and can’t figure out where the hell you put the condom. But is it more awkward than becoming a daddy if you’re not ready for a kid? Get off your ass and search a little harder, or walk to the store and pick up an extra pack. According to the World Health Organization , with perfect use, condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time. That’s pretty damn good.          Relationships   Sex positions that won't get her off    Steer clear of these 4 sex positions that won't get her off.      7. The mistake: You’ve had the same condom hanging out in your wallet forever  The potential damage: Using a condom that hasn’t been properly stored might get you into a situation worse than the sexual slump you just endured. According to Herbenick, extreme heat or cold can damage the latex used in condoms, so the best spot for stashing them is a cool, dark, dry place—like in your nightstand—or a small, hard case (think: one made for business cards). And if you’re really trying to be a douche about the whole thing, there's alwasy this $200 Swarovski crystal condom compact .  8. The mistake: You’re not putting lube inside the condom  The potential damage: Those marathon sex sessions you’ve been having (nice work, bro) are bound to wear down the condom, making it dry and prone to ripping. “Always use lube inside the condom. It prevents breakage and, plus, it actually feels so much better for the condom-wearer,” says Andelloux. Remember: Check the type of lube before you apply, and just use a drop—too much can make the condom slip off.  9. The mistake: You take the condom off before the sex is over  The potential damage: If you're patting yourself on the back for using a condom in the first place...don't. Taking a condom off too early on into sex "can directly compromise the efficacy of condom use," according to a recent study from The Journal of Sexual Health . But you know that, silly! So if you play by the rules and keep that sucker on the entire time, it's 98% certain ( see no. 6 ) you won't have to worry about becoming a daddy. (Just be sure you hold the base of the condom during withdrawal to make sure it doesn't slip off or leak you-know-what.)          Relationships   How much sex is too much?    Can you get too much of a good thing? Doctors weigh in.       10. The mistake: You don’t need condoms—you’re a “pull-out pro”  The potential damage: You might think you have impeccable timing, but even if you do pull out in time, it’s still possible to get her pregnant. How? According to Planned Parenthood , your pre-ejaculate can pick up enough sperm left in your pipes from your last ejaculation to fertilize an egg. Whoa. Now, urinating between ejaculations might help, but as they say, it’s always safer to wrap it before you tap it—and the risk-taking for your non -sexual adventures.

Indeed, according to Dr. John Guillebaud in his book Contraception: Your Questions Answered , some of the lowest birth rates in history pop up around cultures whose primary method of contraception is the pull and pray method.  This method, also known as “Coitus Interruptus” or the “withdrawal method”, was once one of the most popular methods of preventing pregnancy, but in recent times has been cast aside in many cultures.  It turns out though, as long as you get the “pull” part right, there really isn’t much praying necessary.  According to research done in 2008 at the Guttmacher Institute in New York, the withdrawal method, when executed perfectly, is 96% effective for preventing pregnancy.  For comparison, using a condom, when done perfectly, is 98% effective and oral contraception has a “perfect use” rate of 99.7% effective.   Now this is when all three methods are done “perfectly”, so what about in actual practice with everyday people?  The pull and pray method is roughly 82% effective while using a condom is roughly 83% effective, so you are only getting a 1% improvement for your money and effort.  The pill, in contrast, does offer a much better “actual use” rate of about 96%.     So what gives?  Why is withdrawal working just as well as condoms?  It turns out that, according to recent studies, pre-ejaculate almost never contains any sperm.  The few times sperm did show up in the studies, they tended to be immobile and clumped together, so basically dead or completely incapable of impregnating anything.  This is because the only way sperm can get into the pre-ejaculate is if it was already in the urethra from a previous ejaculation, due to the fact that the Cowper’s gland contains no sperm.  Thus, as long as the man has either peed since the last time he ejaculated or it has simply been a while since that time, which probably means he’s peed at some point anyways,  the withdrawal method is extremely effective as a birth control method.  It’s also arguably easier to execute this method “perfectly”, achieving closer to the 96% effective rate, than it is with condoms, with the failure rate of condoms typically coming from the condom breaking.  The primary cause of failure with the pull and pray method lies in the cases where the person executes the praying part perfectly, after the fact, but didn’t manage the “pull” part of the method, which is of course the most important bit; though on failure of that, the praying probably doesn’t hurt. 😉  Bonus Facts:   Worldwide about 3% of couples rely on the withdrawal method as their primary means of contraception, though almost 52% of women report that they have used the withdrawal method at some point in their lives and among the surveyed 21% said they had used this withdrawal method in the last month.  Previous to the Roman Empire, evidence suggests that the withdrawal method was the primary form of contraception used.  This fell out of popularity with the Romans who favored other methods available at the time, most of which have been lost to history.  After the fall of the Roman Empire around the 400s, all methods of contraception fell out of practice in the western world due to Christianity who saw it as sinful.  Around the 1800s, however, the withdrawal method saw a huge resurgence and was the primary form of contraception in the world until methods such as the condom and the pill were introduced in the 20th century.  The oldest documented use of the withdrawal method to avoid pregnancy was the story of Onan in the Torah, believed to have been written around 2500 years ago.

Reply        Don't Believe It   February 23, 2010							10:20 pm      I have two children via the pull and pray method, but no condom babies. You know what they call people who rely on pull and pray? Parents.    Reply        Robby   May 13, 2015							5:07 am      Well, when ya don’t PULL until AFTER ya PRAY, ya should pray for a healthy baby. Also, pulling after a squirt or two doesn’t do the trick either. Just sayin’.    Reply          Ruby   February 24, 2010							4:33 pm      Let’s not forget – pull & pray doesn’t work for gonaherpahivasyphilitis.  Condoms block other things than sperm.    Reply        Robby   May 13, 2015							5:26 am      Unless they have….holes….tear….slip off. Herpes isn’t blocked by condoms, either. Herpes is transmitted by skin contact, not only by penis-to-vagina. Also, HPV (warts) are not reliably blocked by condoms for the same reason. Warts on other parts, like fingers, that are relatively benign and easy to get rid of can really raise hell on the genitals and in the vagina and urethra. Some of the worst strains of HPV do not make visible wart bumps but make cysts buried in the flesh, so a visual snatch inspection it may not catch.    Reply          unforgiven247   February 24, 2010							9:28 pm      Got a question… I slept with two different men…one I used the pull and pray method and the other there was nothing to stop me from getting pregnant.  I’m not sure which one is closer to my conception date because they were unforgivenably close together… So is this method really worth not worrying about or is it likely I have no clue who my babies dad is?    Reply        Robby   May 13, 2015							5:37 am      A blood test can eliminate a possible dad but to prove a dad, a DNA test is required. At your expense, since you’re the accuser/plaintiff. Just curious: Why do you care? Do they both want to acknowledge the baby? Marry you? If not, consider leaving them alone. If you were willing to have sex with a man to whom you were not married, be a big girl and accept the consequence of your choices. [I realize the comment to which I am replying was 5 years ago.]    Reply        Samantha   July 13, 2015							3:50 pm      Um, Robby… It sounds like both men in this situation were also willing to have sex with a woman to whom they were not married so why on earth would the father not be equally responsible for the consequences? It’s fine if you want to consider premarital sex an irresponsible choice… but it is a choice made by two people. If you think that the woman should accept the consequences of that choice than logic dictates that so should the man. To suggest otherwise is pure, unadulterated misogyny. Also, did you ever think it might be a good idea to know who the father is for genetic purposes in terms of what the child could inherit and also down the road the child might like to know and have a right to know who it’s biological father is?    Reply        John   April 26, 2016							8:34 am      Although yes, the males assumed the exact risk when they decided to have unprotected coitus, it was the female who decided to – on her own accord mind you, to sleep with two men unprotected within a short time period. no one told her to go around screwing all types of guys raw. that’s her own fault. she should be a big girl and put on her big girl pants. hopefully if she dodged a bullet and nothing was conceived, she should really think about her rather reckless behavior. otherwise she’s going to go down this road again. i seriously doubt both guys were cool with sleeping with the same girl back to back.    Reply              Luis   March 3, 2010							6:01 pm      My health book showed the withdrawl method was 80% reliable. I’m surprised only 3% of people said they rely on it. My wife and I have used the withdrawl method for about 8 years. One month we decided to try to have a baby and were successful. I had thoughts that we may have trouble getting pregnant because there were no accidental babys over all those years, but getting pregnant after the first try proved that wrong.    Reply         OnTehOtherSide   June 30, 2010							3:36 pm      Teh key word is execution. If you don’t pull out in time, you pay… for 18 yrs and that is the hardest part.

Yeah, but “almost never” is not “never.” Why would you take that chance?  Shame on you for giving people faulty information.  Also, wouldn’t you be a little worried about STIs?    Reply        Daven   December 22, 2010							12:21 pm      @bullshit: “almost never is not never”:  It helps to read the next sentence before commenting: “The few times sperm did show up in the studies, they tended to be immobile and clumped together, so basically dead or completely incapable of impregnating anything.”  “Shame on you for giving people faulty information”: Yep, who’s ever heard of scientifically gathered information being accurate anyways?  Personally, I like to only rely on completely subjective data that I heard from a guy I know who knows a guy who one time thought something the opposite of what the scientific data showed.  “Also, wouldn’t you be a little worried about STI’s?”: This article wasn’t about sexually transmitted diseases, unless you consider kids to be a sexually transmitted disease, which my brother constantly tells me is the case. 😉  It was simply an article pointing out the interesting fact that the pull and pray method, when done properly, is actually a pretty effective method of birth control, which I found fascinating and thought other people might as well.  In the coming zombie apocalypse, when condoms and other such methods of contraception aren’t readily available, this will be good information to know. 😉    Reply        Sheogorath   April 29, 2015							1:43 pm      Agreed. Pregnancy is a sexually transmitted condition , not a disease.    Reply           Lydia   December 29, 2010							8:21 pm      My story is very similar to Luis’. My boyfriend and I would always use the withdrawal method when we were dating – we knew each other to be free of any diseases, and we trusted one another to stay an help if we DID end up with a pregnancy. After many years of sex that way, we ended up married, and wanting a baby. Well, after so many years of never having gotten pregnant without any use of commercial contraceptive, we were relatively sure one of us could easily just be incapable of fertility. Lo and behold, years after our first attempt, our Kara is starting third grade and our second is on its way. Interestingly, all the couples I know who have had trouble conceiving have all relied on birth control pills before deciding to try for a baby. I’d like to see a study performed on any possible adverse side effects of contraceptive pills.    Reply       Stu8080   December 30, 2010							11:41 am      Everyone seems to have overlooked the fact that the hard bit is the pull… The major caveat is that its only “when executed perfectly”.  If your sex is so mechanical that you are constantly evaluating when that point is then, personally, i think that becoming a parent is going to be a blessing to you, you need to find a girl who wants to do it with you more than once!  Seriously though, this is bad advice. If you ever had to apologise for not waiting for her, then you know you will have to apologise for not pulling out in time.    Reply        CaptButtNakid   September 26, 2013							9:43 am      There’s nothing ‘mechanical’ about realizing you are on the proverbial point of no-return! If you cannot tell when you’re about to let loose, then you should be forbidden from sex and practice masturbation until you get a clue.  My GF-who-became-wife and I alternated condoms, pills AND pull and pray in time together, the only failure came when she deliberately went off the pill without telling me one time. The next child was on purpose, after a long period of relying on pullout. The Method works great, as long as you, the man, have enough control over your dick.

Reply       Reki   June 9, 2011							8:41 pm      Wow, really? As it turns out, condoms do not break as often as they say they do when used correctly. You kept that one in your wallet for a month? Throw it away. That one will most likely break. FRESH or NEW condoms don’t break easily, despite what they tell you.  1) If they are too old, they will break. Its YOUR fault. 2) If you don’t use enough lube, or don’t stop when you need more, they will break. It’s YOUR fault. 3) If they are not rolled on right or pulled out right after, they can leak. It’s YOUR fault. 4) If you put your penis back in after taking off the condom, why even wear one to begin with?  In other words, condoms work. It’s the idiots that don’t know how to use them that don’t.    Reply       Treat Keratosis Pilaris   July 1, 2011							7:47 am      It also provides no protection against STDs. Condoms still win.

Reply        Pro-withdrawl method   January 28, 2013							8:29 pm      I dated a girl for one year and eight months having sex on a regular basis using only the pullout method and only doing it correctly (pulling out in time and peeing after each ejaculation before going at it again).  To the one that speculated that sex done this way would be mechanical because you’re too focused on  waiting for the right time to pull out…. I can say its not like that for me at all. Usually I’m trying to make my partner happy, or myself if she’s finished already, and sometimes that doesn’t even happen…. but when it does you know a bit ahead of time, you don’t need to wait or pay that much attention to know when the pleasure gets to that point. I’ve had a 100% success rate but I know my body very well and have practiced self control.  Basicly if you’ve never masturbated before… don’t try this… if you aren’t very good at masturbating…. don’t try this… If you’re drunk, or under any influence that slows your reaction time…. don’t try this…  But if you’re good at it and have self control, its a viable solution.

If the test doesn’t do that (either guy could be), a DNA test can tell 100% if negative and 99% if it shows positive. This assumes you can find either of them once they find out you’re preg!  OnTehOtherSide, an unkind remark. At least she wasn’t having the baby killed.  Luis, “… getting pregnant after the first try proved that wrong.” Not really. All it really proves is that no tadpoles met Miss Ova successfully until one did.  Condoms reduce but do not eliminate the possibility of STIs. Per sex act. However, their availability does encourage more sex acts, so their availability increases the incidence of STIs and pregnancies in a population. If having condoms available makes no difference to you how often you have sex, that is, you would have as much sex if no condoms were available,  condoms will reduce the likelihood of STIs and, if you would use no other contraception, pregnancy.  Planned Parenthood has come under fire (again!) for distributing millions of defective condoms (holes, break easily). They get more abortion business that way. Like they do, not reporting suspected statutory rape when underage girls come in for abortions. The rapist (legally speaking if not forcible) is then free to generate more abortion business with the same girl. And others.    Reply       RTFA   January 2, 2012							11:38 pm      All discussion on STDs are irrelevant.  The topic is about preventing pregnancy.  Not preventing STDs or safe sex.    Reply       Neville   March 26, 2013							12:25 am      My partner and I have been together for close to 3 months. From the first time we had sex (we were both tested first and are 100% clean), we’ve soly relied on using the pullout method. We both feel the withdrawal method is a great method of birth control as it’s 100% natural without any hormones involved and it’s cumfortable too. We have not had any pregnancy scares to date as I know my body very well and know when to pullout & spurt my babybatter elsewhere lol 😉 After each ejaculation, I always urinate so that any residual sperm left in my urethra is flushed out before going for Round Two. It also helps to wash your appendage with soap just to be safe afterwards as well 😉  I would only recommend this form of birth control in monogamous relationships (NOT Casual relationships) as it does not protect against any STI’s.    Reply       Emily   July 20, 2013							10:19 am      My partner and I have used the pull out method for 2 years successfully. I tried the pill a couple of times for a short while and the side effects were horrible and they messed my system up for several weeks afterwards. In my experience, the pull out method is natural, there are no nasty side effects that you get from the pill (the pill reduced my sex drive, gave me acne, made me moody, made me feel sick all the time and gave me daily headaches and when i discontinued i bled for about a month every day each time and i had no idea when i was ovulating or when my period would come). While using the pull out method, i must add that i make sure i’m aware of when i am ovulating and when i am likely to be most fertile. During these days we have oral sex instead. I wish GPs would educated people more about the pull out method rather than dismiss it completely.    Reply       Me   September 10, 2013							12:31 pm      My then girlfriend/finance and I started using the pull out method from the moment we became engaged. We felt it was the best method for us. Add to that the fact that my girlfriend…now my wife of more than 30 years…could somewhat accurately predict her ovulation cycle we were successful for nearly 4 years.  After our wedding we still used withdrawl and did not get pregnant for 3 years. We now have 4 children.    Reply        Alli3   April 18, 2014							8:11 am      Matt, LMAO.

Reply         crabz   September 21, 2013							10:54 pm      so…. urinate before sex, pull-out before near ejaculation, urinate again, then round two, and so on..  is this correct?

Reply       Experienced   May 6, 2014							1:14 am      My fiance and I have been using this method since we started dating (Almost 6 years). We’ll go at it, he’ll pull out, ejaculate, pee, then we’ll go at it again. We go a few rounds. I have yet to become pregnant. I’ve always wondered if I was infertile, but based on this I hope I’m not. Guess we won’t find out until we start trying for a baby.    Reply        Experienced   May 6, 2014							1:17 am      By the way I’m not on the pill or any other type of contraception, sometimes we’ll use condoms, but we both prefer the pullout method. It just feels better.    Reply         John   April 26, 2016							8:49 am      I’m in my 30’s and personally have been with circa 100 women. I know that’s utterly disgraceful and all, but hear me out. I exclusively used the pull out method and never once did i get any of them pregnant. there were however, two instances when a condom was being used and broke from the prolonged fiction. in those two situations we simply went to the local pharmacy and purchased a “plan B” morning after pill, which is good for up to 72 hours I believe. It wasn’t the cheapest thing in the world to buy, but considering the alternative, it was a no-brainer. For a long time I thought that maybe I might be sterile since the odds of no one getting pregnant to me seemed pretty astronomical. But in fact, it turns out that I was always disciplined when it came to pulling out prior to climax. I know for a fact I am indeed not sterile since later on after years of dating a special girl, we decided to try for a baby. I’m not entirely if it was due to her being underweight at the time (85lbs, 5’3″), but it took us close to 6 whole months to finally conceive. and that was with daily deliberate baby-making coitus (creampie, if you want it to call it that.)

Who We Are  About               Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you?

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

What Are The Success Rates Of Having A Tubal Ligation Successfully Reversed? »               What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant without Ejaculation?   Health and Well-Being  No comments    It is absolutely possible to become pregnant even if a man does not ejaculate, or does not ejaculate during intercourse.  The most reliable methods of birth control involve the use of either a contraceptive medication, such as birth control pills, or a barrier, such as a condom.  It is possible for pre-seminal fluid (sometimes called precum) to have sperm in it.  While pre-seminal fluid is not produced with sperm in it, if there is sperm in the man’s urethra from a previous ejaculation, the pre-seminal fluid may pick up the sperm and carry it along.  If a man urinates after a previous ejaculation but before having sex, it is much less likely that his pre-seminal fluid will have sperm in it.  There are other factors that make “pulling out” a higher risk for becoming pregnant.  Trying to avoid getting pregnant without ejaculation relies on the man’s ability to know his own body.  He has to be able to tell right away when he is about to ejaculate so that he can withdrawal in time.  In addition, using this method for birth control relies on the man’s self-control;  he has to be able to stop himself at the very height of passion to make sure that he does not ejaculate.     Using this practice of “pulling out” as a form of birth control is not entirely reliable.  Success rates run anywhere from 73 to 96% effectiveness.  In contrast, the birth control pill is more than 99% effective, and the condom, when used correctly, is around 99% effective.  In general, the withdrawal method is not always the best method of birth control.  If barriers, such as condoms, are not an option, and medication, such as the birth control pill, is not an option, you might consider a combination of withdrawal and the rhythm method.  The rhythm method is based on the idea that you won’t have sex when you are fertile.  This works best for women who have a regular cycle, and perfectly practice the rhythm method.  This method does require constant vigilance, and cooperation of your partner.  For religious and other reasons, this is the preferred birth control method for many women.  Rhythm, like withdrawal, can be very effective.  However, if a woman doesn’t have a menstrual cycle that is constant and predictable, the chances of becoming pregnant increase.  The chances of becoming pregnant also increase dramatically if the partners don’t strictly follow the calendar.
