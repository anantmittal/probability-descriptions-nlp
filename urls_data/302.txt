         Conjoined twins   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   "Siamese twins" redirects here. For other uses, see Siamese twins (disambiguation) .    Conjoined twins    Synonyms  Siamese twins       X-ray of conjoined twins, cephalothoracopagus.    Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

When the bodies of twins connect, they are called conjoined twins. Conjoined twins begin as a single fertilized egg. Usually, a single egg develops into 1 baby. Sometimes a single egg divides in half 1 to 2 weeks after it’s fertilized. This creates a set of identical twins. The exact cause of conjoined twinning is not known. There are 2 theories:  The egg divides late and does not divide completely.  The egg divides completely then it joins back together.    The connection between the twins’ bodies may be fairly simple. They may share only a small amount of tissue, and both children may have all the organs and other structures they need. For example, the twins may be joined at the belly with a “bridge” connecting their livers.  Usually, the connection is more complex. In some cases, children may share:  Vital organs, like 1 heart  Many structures, like several parts of the digestive, genital and urinary systems  A large segment of the body, like all of the lower body  Part of the brain and skull  The twins’ symptoms may depend on which structures they share. Types of Conjoined Twins Doctors group conjoined twins into the following categories based on where they are joined. Joined at the chest This is the most common type of conjoined twins and is called thoracopagus (pronounced thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus). About 40% of all conjoined twins are in this group. These twins are face to face. In about 75% of cases, the twins share a heart. Twins joined at the chest may also share a liver, biliary tract (which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine) and upper digestive tract (esophagus, stomach and small intestine). Joined from the breastbone to the waist This type of conjoined twins, called omphalopagus (pronounced om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) or xiphopagus (pronounced xi-phop-a-gus), are face to face. They may share a liver, biliary tract and upper digestive tract. About 34% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the sacrum (lower back) and buttock area This type of conjoined twins, called pygopagus (pronounced pie-GOP-uh-gus), are back to back. They may share part of the lower digestive tract (large intestine, rectum and anus) and part of the skeleton, nervous system and genitals. About 18% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined in the pelvic area, possibly up to the breastbone This type of conjoined twins, called ischiopagus (pronounced is-kee-OP-uh-gus), may be oriented to each other in different ways. In general, they partly face each other. They may share a liver and biliary tract, part of the upper and all of the lower digestive tract, the genital and urinary systems and part of the skeleton. About 6% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the head This type of conjoined twins, called craniopagus (pronounced kray-nee-OP-uh-gus), may share a skull, brain and other parts of the nervous system. About 2% of conjoined twins are in this group. Outlook for Conjoined Twins About 40% of conjoined twins are not alive when they are delivered (stillborn). About 35% die within a day after they are born. Although most sets of conjoined twins do not survive because their organs cannot support them, more conjoined twins survive now than in the past. Advances in imaging, surgical techniques and anesthesia have helped improve chances for survival. We also have tools to detect their condition before birth so families and doctors can plan their care before they are born. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years while conjoined, sometimes even into adulthood. Others may need to be separated by surgery. The success of the separation surgery depends on many factors, mainly where the twins are connected and which structures they share. In many cases, both twins survive after surgery. In some cases, only 1 survives because the other doesn’t have the organs they need or the organs are not well developed. Sometimes neither child survives. Conjoined Twins at Seattle Children’s Seattle Children’s provides complete care to meet all of the healthcare needs of conjoined twins from birth through childhood and into the early adult years. This may include surgery to separate the twins. Our team has the knowledge, experience and facilities to perform separation surgeries – and to provide care for conjoined twins who cannot be separated or whose family decides not to separate them. Separation is not the only choice for these children. Some parents may choose not to have the surgery even though their children could be separated. You will meet with a team of doctors to talk about your twins, including the benefits and risks of having surgery and of not being separated. Our goal is to help you understand your twins’ health and all your options so you can make the choices that are best for your family. The experts you need are here Seattle Children’s is a national leader in successful surgery for conjoined twins. We base treatment plans on years of experience and the newest research on what works best – and most safely – for children and teens. This experience helps us work with you to decide on the best treatment. Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. Your child and family get support Many types of healthcare providers are needed to assess your twins’ condition and plan and carry out their treatment. Along with your children’s surgeons, you are connected with doctors trained to care for new babies with complex problems ( neonatologists ), nurses, dietitians , child life specialists , social workers and others. We work together to meet all of your children’s health needs and help your family through this experience. Conjoined Twins Symptoms Conjoined twins may be connected to each other in many different ways. Their health and any symptoms depend on how each child developed, which structures they share and how well their organs work. Most conjoined twins are born early (premature). This means their lungs have probably not finished developing and breathing problems are common. Conjoined Twins Diagnosis In most cases, doctors see that twins are conjoined during a routine ultrasound late in the first trimester of pregnancy or in the second trimester. Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program provides care for pregnant women and their conjoined twins. Each set of conjoined twins is unique. Decisions about their care are complex and often hard for their families and their healthcare providers. The chance for survival is an important factor in these decisions. Another important factor is the quality of life for the twins if they stay conjoined or are separated. Before delivery Once your doctor can see where the twins are joined by ultrasound, the doctor will have more information on the structures the twins may share. Other imaging studies can also take pictures of the twins before birth. They include ultrasound, echocardiography and prenatal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) . Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. We will perform the imaging studies and explain what the images show. You can consult with Seattle Children’s doctors who care for conjoined twins about what to expect, including whether separation is possible. Some parents continue their pregnancy. Others decide to end their pregnancy. For parents continuing their pregnancy, doctors will suggest careful monitoring and planning. This helps the healthcare team prepare for the diagnostic tests and provide the treatments the twins may need once they are born. Prenatal care of conjoined twins usually includes scheduling delivery by cesarean section (C-section) a month before the twins’ due date. This is because a vaginal birth is too hard for the mother and babies. During and after delivery After delivery by C-section, the twins will likely need many types of imaging studies and tests to learn as much as possible about how they are connected and their overall health. This information will help you and the healthcare team decide how to care for the twins. Studies and tests your babies need will depend on where the twins are joined and their health. A few of the common tests for conjoined twins are:   Heart tests, such as echocardiography and electrocardiography  Ultrasound  CT (computed tomography) scan   Conjoined Twins Treatment The treatment that conjoined twins may need depends on the health of each twin and where and how they are joined. Creating a treatment plan The connection between the twins’ bodies may range from fairly simple to very complex. Both children may have all the organs and other structures they need, or they may share other structures or vital organs, like their heart. Their bodies may be able to support both their lives, or it may be hard for 1 or both to survive because of health problems. Treatment for each set of twins is unique. Experts from Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will work closely with each other and with you to provide the care you and your twins need before the babies are born and plan for their needs after birth. Before birth and in the months soon after, your twins’ healthcare team will gather as much information as they can about their anatomy and how well their bodies work. The team will use this information to create a detailed treatment plan. The main goal is to give both children the best chance for a good quality of life, whenever possible. Deciding about separation surgery Your twins’ treatment plan may or may not include surgery to separate them. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years – even into adulthood – still physically connected to each other. For conjoined twins, being connected to their sibling is “normal.” Some conjoined twins have happy, healthy, full lives by staying connected. For some twins, separation surgery is too difficult, so staying connected is the only real option. Some conjoined twins do have surgery to be separated, usually in the first 12 months of life. This may be the best option for the physical health of the children, while also giving them the chance to have independent bodies and lives. Separation surgery is sometimes the best option because the twins’ shared organs cannot support both of them. Or it may be the best option because 1 twin is unlikely to survive and separation is the only way to give the other twin a chance to live. Your healthcare team will speak with you about what your twins’ lives may be like whether they are joined or separated. They will help you consider which option is best for your twins. When separation is planned Surgery to separate conjoined twins requires detailed planning whenever possible. To prepare for surgery, your twins will need providers who are experts in many different types of care. They will work together to plan the steps and timing of the surgery and the care your children will need before and after. One doctor will oversee the team and coordinate all parts of the plan. In most cases, doctors will do the separation surgery after your twins are at least 4 months old. This gives their bodies a chance to grow so it’s easier for doctors to do the surgery and easier for the twins to withstand the surgery. This also allows time for the many imaging studies, tests and other procedures that might be needed to learn about your twins’ bodies or prepare them for separation. In some cases, conjoined twins need to be separated before they are 4 months old because of a health emergency or an urgent problem that cannot wait. Often, 2 complete surgery teams work together very closely to separate twins. This can be important to take care of the complex needs of both twins at the same time while they are being separated and right after. Once your twins are separated, each may need additional surgeries to correct some of the anatomic (structural) problems they may have. Follow-up care Your twins will need long-term follow-up visits throughout their childhood and into their early adult years to check their growth and development whether they stay connected or are separated. Most will need surgeries or other types of treatment for health issues that arise over time.

Conjoined Twins (less commonly referred to as Siamese Twins following the birth of Chang and Eng Bunker in Siam), are genetically identical, develop from the same egg, and often share vital human organs and limbs. Abby and Brittany Hensel are about to be the United States' most famous conjoined twins. Their lives "Abby & Brittany," will be featured in a documentary series airing Tuesday, Sept. 28 at 10 p.m. on TLC . Here's a quick look at their story, plus the stories of nine pairs who've made history around the world. 10. Abby and Brittany Hensel Abby and Brittany Hensel were born in 1990. Their parents were told they probably wouldn't survive the night, but 22 years later, the two are off to college. Their case is rare; they have two hearts, two sets of lungs, and two separate brains. One controls the right side of the body, the other the left side, but the two move together, have two drivers licenses, ride a bike, and navigate the daily lives of 20somethings with ease. Since they were born, the two have been featured in magazines and talk shows.    Chang and Eng Bunker  http://jilltracy.com      9. Chang and Eng Bunker Chang and Eng Bunker were born in 1811 in Siam (now Thailand). Their livers were fused together and could have easily been separated with modern medicine, but since the operation was much more difficult in their time, the two remained conjoined. Like many conjoined twins, they toured the world as entertainers and made money as spectacles and medical wonders. Eventually, the two married sisters, settled in North Carolina, and had more than 20 children.    Daisy and Violet Hilton  http://afflictor.com      8. Daisy and Violet Hilton The Hilton Sisters were born in 1908. Their 19-year-old mother worked in a bar and sold the twins to her boss, who toured them around the world. They gained recognition in Germany, the U.S. and Australia and tap danced in a Bob Hope act. They gained independence in 1931 and went into vaudeville, where they dubbed themselves the Hilton Sisters. After performing, marrying, and divorcing, they ended up in Florida, where they had a hamburger stand. The sisters ended up in North Carolina after a public appearance (their tour manager ditched them there), and ended up with a gig at a grocery store until they died in 1969.    Lori and George Schappell  http://www.click.ro      7. Lori and George Schappell Lori and George (originally named Dori) were born in 1961, conjoined at the head. They share 30 percent of their brain matter. They grew up in an institution in Pennsylvania, but were released in their 20s. Under the stage name Reba Schappell (after Reba McEntire), George has performed internationally singing country music, has won an L.A. Music Award for Best New Country Artist, and sang a track for Hollywood film Stuck on You . Dori lives a quieter life, has a gig doing laundry at a hospital and works around George's music schedule. In 2006, George was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and declared a year later that he identifies as a male and permanently changed his name. The two are still living in    Ronnie and Donnie Galyon  http://oddculture.com      6. Donnie and Ronnie Galyon Donnie and Ronnie Gaylon currently hold the Guinness world record for the oldest living conjoined twins. They were born in Ohio in 1951 and are joined from the groin to the sternum, sharing all male organs. They were abandoned by their mother and raised by their father and stepmother. They were toured around the US and Latin America, where they made enough money to support their family as side show acts for more than 30 years. They still make television appearances and live in Ohio.    Eliza (or Elisa) and Mary Chalkhurst  http://phreeque.tripod.com      5. Eliza and Mary Chalkhurst The Chalkhursts were one of the first documented cases of conjoined twins when they were born in England in 1100. Most illustrations depict the two joined at the hip, though some picture the two joined at the shoulder as well. Eliza and Mary lived until 1136, and left money and land to be distributed to the poor in their village.    Millie and Christine McCoy  wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/MillieandChristineMcCoy(1873).jpg      4. Millie and Christine McCoy Millie and Christine McCoy were born in 1851 to parents who were slaves in North Carolina. They were sold to multiple showmen at a young age and traveled under the name "The Two-Headed Nightingale" until they were kidnapped by another showman and taken to the United Kingdom. There, the McCoy's kidnapper was forced to release the girls back to one of their original showmen since slavery had been outlawed in the UK. Millie and Christine were reunited with their mother and were raised to speak five languages, dance, and sing. They toured with the Barnum circus and made public appearances before retiring and living until they were 61.    Krista and Tatiana Hogan  coolpicturegallery.net      3. Krista and Tatiana Hogan Krista Hogan and Tatiana Hogan were born in 2006 in Vancouver, Canada. The two are joined at the head and share a thalamus, which connects their brainstems enabling the two to share brain signals, emotions, and thoughts. Research also confirmed that the two share visual cortex signals, so the two can actually experience what the other twin is seeing. The two have had a series of health issues and associated surgeries, but are currently doing well and making occasional television appearances.    Ladan and Laleh Bijani  http://www.transporting.to      2. Ladan and Laleh Bijani Ladan and Laleh Bijani were born in Iran in 1979 and were lost in the hospital after the doctor responsible for them fled for the United States during the Islamic Revolution. They were raised by Dr. Alireza Safaian, who the girls chose to stay with even when they were reconnected with their natural parents years later. Ladan and Laleh had very different personalities and often struggled on what they wanted to do with their lives. One wanted to go to law school, the other wanted to go to school for journalism; one was very outgoing and the other shy. Since they were children, they wanted to be separated, but since the two were joined at the head, most doctors refused to perform the surgery since it was so dangerous. In 2002, the two met with a neurosurgeon from Singapore who had separated conjoined twins joined at the head before. He warned the two that the surgery was very risky, but Ladan and Laleh insisted. More than 28 surgeons and 100 hospital staff members performed the operation, but after complications following the separation and a large amount of blood loss, the two died hours later.

Giacomo and Giovanni Battista The Tocci brothers were born in Italy in 1877. They were joined at the waist and shared an abdomen, pelvis, and legs. The brothers were given to the The Royal Academy of Medicine in Turin when they were a month old, and were toured, studied, and put on exhibition throughout the U.S. and Europe as the "Two-Headed Boy." The two were reportedly never able to coordinate their movements (one controlled the left leg, the other, the right leg), and were wheelchair bound for the rest of their lives.

Sarah Barness     Mar 05, 2015                     Most people don't think twice about performing seemingly simple tasks like walking down the street, getting in the car or going for a dip in the pool. But for Ohio twins, Ronnie and Donnie, every activity, from the biggest to the very smallest, is an amazing feat of effort, cooperation and compromise.      At 64 years old, Ronnie and Donnie Galyon are the world's oldest living conjoined twins.             Previously, Italian conjoined twins Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci , who were born in 1877 and lived until the age of 63, held the record.      But now, Ronnie and Donnie have taken the record, much to the surprise of family members and medical professionals.      Their younger brother Jim, told Nine Lives Media 1 that when Ronnie and Donnie were born in 1951, doctors didn't even expect them to make it through the night. But over six decades later, they are still thriving.      "They're one body, but very much two human beings," says Jim of his two brothers.             The twins have four arms, four legs and share a lower digestive tract and pelvic area . They've spent every waking moment with each other, face-to-face, but have never known any other way of life. ABC News reports the twins "performed in circus and sideshow acts" before retiring in 1991 in the Dayton area.      Now, with Jim's help, the twins can relax at home and go about their daily routine.             MLive.com notes that a customized bed from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital has also greatly helped the twins, allowing them to sleep better and improving their "health and quality of life." The brothers' sister-in-law, Mary Galyon, told MLive.com that this bed has been a huge factor as to why the twins have made it this far.      Though their customized bed and family support has helped them pull through, their love for each other has ultimately been most important.       imgur.com       To learn more about Ronnie and Donnie, watch this video:           Like this story?

These conjoined twins are joined at the chest (thoracopagus). They have separate hearts but share other organs.     Conjoined twins are two babies who are born physically connected to each other.  Conjoined twins develop when an early embryo only partially separates to form two individuals. Although two fetuses will develop from this embryo, they will remain physically connected — most often at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Conjoined twins may also share one or more internal organs.  Many conjoined twins die in the womb (stillborn) or die shortly after birth. Some surviving conjoined twins can be surgically separated. The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team.          Symptoms There are no specific signs or symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than with a single fetus, and there may be more fatigue, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using standard ultrasound.  How twins are joined  Conjoined twins are typically classified according to where they're joined, usually at matching sites, and sometimes at more than one site. They sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. The specific anatomy of each pair of conjoined twins is unique.  Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites:   Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins.  Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver, and some share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and colon. They generally do not share a heart.  Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal tract, and a few share the genital and urinary organs.  Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare.  Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs.  Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the abdomen and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs.  Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue.  Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the face and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.   In rare cases, twins may be asymmetrically conjoined, with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Identical twins (monozygotic twins) occur when a single fertilized egg splits and develops into two individuals. Eight to 12 days after conception, the embryonic layers that will split to form monozygotic twins begin to develop into specific organs and structures.  It's believed that when the embryo splits later than this — usually between 13 and 15 days after conception — separation stops before the process is complete, and the resulting twins are conjoined.  An alternative theory suggests that two separate embryos may somehow fuse together in early development.  What might cause either scenario to occur is unknown.  Risk factors Because conjoined twins are so rare, and the cause isn't clear, it's unknown what might make some couples more likely to have conjoined twins.  Complications Conjoined twins must be delivered by cesarean section. Many conjoined twins are stillborn or die shortly after birth. Not all surviving twins are candidates for separation surgery. The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team.

Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail Giving birth to multiples is rare, and even more so identical ones, but it’s far rarer without in vitro fertilization (IVF). A mom in Texas defied one in 50 million odds by giving birth to identical female triplets , including conjoined twins at the pelvis. Silvia Hernandez, husband Raul Torres, and son Raul Jr. welcomed the birth of Catalina and conjoined twins Ximena and Scarlett at Corpus Christi Medical Center just a few days earlier than expected.    Torres and son Raul Jr. at the hospital with Hernandez showing ultrasound images of the identical female triplets.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook  The family was thrilled they were expecting triplets, but happiness quickly turned into fear when they soon learned two of them were conjoined. "The truth is I cried, not because of how the babies would look because we knew we would do our best to give them the best and most productive life posible [sic], I cried because the doctor said we had to understand and accept the fact that once they were born they could die," wrote Hernandez on the Facebook page “ Siamese Triplets Hernandez Torres .”    Ultrasound of identical female triplets, including conjoined twins.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres  The triplets were born just shy of 34 weeks and all weigh 4 pounds and 11 ounces. The birth of triplets is more common with IVF treatment, whereas conceiving identical triplets, also known as trizygotic triplets, is naturally extremely rare. The odds of having identical triplets are one in 60,000 to one in 200 million. Moreover, only one in six triplet pregnancies lead to the birth of three babies of the same sex. The Texas family continued to beat the odds with two out of three identical triplets born conjoined. These twins are genetically identical and always the same sex. Conjoined twins are also only live births one in every 200,000, with a few surviving past day one, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center . This means the odds of naturally conceiving identical female triplets, two of them conjoined, is about one in a 50 million occurrence.    Conjoined twins Scarlett and Ximena at the hospital.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook   Hernandez had a difficult pregnancy anticipating the arrival of the triplets. Torres felt compelled to leave his job to take care of his wife and their 3-year-old son. “Sometimes she couldn't even walk, stand up, go to the bathroom take a shower or anything," Raul told Kiii News .    Raul holding single identical female triplet Catalina.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook   The family has started a GoFundMe page for financial assistance on paying the babies’ medical bills. The small conjoined babies must undergo surgery within six months to a year before they can be separated. Despite medical expenses and a tough future that waits the Texas family, Torres sees these girls as his “miracle babies.” “It's like a gift of God,” he told Kiii News. “God chose us for a reason, to take care of them. He sent us little angels for a reason, so it's a big blessing for us.” The conjoined twins are now being cared for at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Conjoined twins    Synonyms  Siamese twins       X-ray of conjoined twins, cephalothoracopagus.    Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

When the bodies of twins connect, they are called conjoined twins. Conjoined twins begin as a single fertilized egg. Usually, a single egg develops into 1 baby. Sometimes a single egg divides in half 1 to 2 weeks after it’s fertilized. This creates a set of identical twins. The exact cause of conjoined twinning is not known. There are 2 theories:  The egg divides late and does not divide completely.  The egg divides completely then it joins back together.    The connection between the twins’ bodies may be fairly simple. They may share only a small amount of tissue, and both children may have all the organs and other structures they need. For example, the twins may be joined at the belly with a “bridge” connecting their livers.  Usually, the connection is more complex. In some cases, children may share:  Vital organs, like 1 heart  Many structures, like several parts of the digestive, genital and urinary systems  A large segment of the body, like all of the lower body  Part of the brain and skull  The twins’ symptoms may depend on which structures they share. Types of Conjoined Twins Doctors group conjoined twins into the following categories based on where they are joined. Joined at the chest This is the most common type of conjoined twins and is called thoracopagus (pronounced thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus). About 40% of all conjoined twins are in this group. These twins are face to face. In about 75% of cases, the twins share a heart. Twins joined at the chest may also share a liver, biliary tract (which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine) and upper digestive tract (esophagus, stomach and small intestine). Joined from the breastbone to the waist This type of conjoined twins, called omphalopagus (pronounced om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) or xiphopagus (pronounced xi-phop-a-gus), are face to face. They may share a liver, biliary tract and upper digestive tract. About 34% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the sacrum (lower back) and buttock area This type of conjoined twins, called pygopagus (pronounced pie-GOP-uh-gus), are back to back. They may share part of the lower digestive tract (large intestine, rectum and anus) and part of the skeleton, nervous system and genitals. About 18% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined in the pelvic area, possibly up to the breastbone This type of conjoined twins, called ischiopagus (pronounced is-kee-OP-uh-gus), may be oriented to each other in different ways. In general, they partly face each other. They may share a liver and biliary tract, part of the upper and all of the lower digestive tract, the genital and urinary systems and part of the skeleton. About 6% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the head This type of conjoined twins, called craniopagus (pronounced kray-nee-OP-uh-gus), may share a skull, brain and other parts of the nervous system. About 2% of conjoined twins are in this group. Outlook for Conjoined Twins About 40% of conjoined twins are not alive when they are delivered (stillborn). About 35% die within a day after they are born. Although most sets of conjoined twins do not survive because their organs cannot support them, more conjoined twins survive now than in the past. Advances in imaging, surgical techniques and anesthesia have helped improve chances for survival. We also have tools to detect their condition before birth so families and doctors can plan their care before they are born. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years while conjoined, sometimes even into adulthood. Others may need to be separated by surgery. The success of the separation surgery depends on many factors, mainly where the twins are connected and which structures they share. In many cases, both twins survive after surgery. In some cases, only 1 survives because the other doesn’t have the organs they need or the organs are not well developed. Sometimes neither child survives. Conjoined Twins at Seattle Children’s Seattle Children’s provides complete care to meet all of the healthcare needs of conjoined twins from birth through childhood and into the early adult years. This may include surgery to separate the twins. Our team has the knowledge, experience and facilities to perform separation surgeries – and to provide care for conjoined twins who cannot be separated or whose family decides not to separate them. Separation is not the only choice for these children. Some parents may choose not to have the surgery even though their children could be separated. You will meet with a team of doctors to talk about your twins, including the benefits and risks of having surgery and of not being separated. Our goal is to help you understand your twins’ health and all your options so you can make the choices that are best for your family. The experts you need are here Seattle Children’s is a national leader in successful surgery for conjoined twins. We base treatment plans on years of experience and the newest research on what works best – and most safely – for children and teens. This experience helps us work with you to decide on the best treatment. Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. Your child and family get support Many types of healthcare providers are needed to assess your twins’ condition and plan and carry out their treatment. Along with your children’s surgeons, you are connected with doctors trained to care for new babies with complex problems ( neonatologists ), nurses, dietitians , child life specialists , social workers and others. We work together to meet all of your children’s health needs and help your family through this experience. Conjoined Twins Symptoms Conjoined twins may be connected to each other in many different ways. Their health and any symptoms depend on how each child developed, which structures they share and how well their organs work. Most conjoined twins are born early (premature). This means their lungs have probably not finished developing and breathing problems are common. Conjoined Twins Diagnosis In most cases, doctors see that twins are conjoined during a routine ultrasound late in the first trimester of pregnancy or in the second trimester. Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program provides care for pregnant women and their conjoined twins. Each set of conjoined twins is unique. Decisions about their care are complex and often hard for their families and their healthcare providers. The chance for survival is an important factor in these decisions. Another important factor is the quality of life for the twins if they stay conjoined or are separated. Before delivery Once your doctor can see where the twins are joined by ultrasound, the doctor will have more information on the structures the twins may share. Other imaging studies can also take pictures of the twins before birth. They include ultrasound, echocardiography and prenatal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) . Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. We will perform the imaging studies and explain what the images show. You can consult with Seattle Children’s doctors who care for conjoined twins about what to expect, including whether separation is possible. Some parents continue their pregnancy. Others decide to end their pregnancy. For parents continuing their pregnancy, doctors will suggest careful monitoring and planning. This helps the healthcare team prepare for the diagnostic tests and provide the treatments the twins may need once they are born. Prenatal care of conjoined twins usually includes scheduling delivery by cesarean section (C-section) a month before the twins’ due date. This is because a vaginal birth is too hard for the mother and babies. During and after delivery After delivery by C-section, the twins will likely need many types of imaging studies and tests to learn as much as possible about how they are connected and their overall health. This information will help you and the healthcare team decide how to care for the twins. Studies and tests your babies need will depend on where the twins are joined and their health. A few of the common tests for conjoined twins are:   Heart tests, such as echocardiography and electrocardiography  Ultrasound  CT (computed tomography) scan   Conjoined Twins Treatment The treatment that conjoined twins may need depends on the health of each twin and where and how they are joined. Creating a treatment plan The connection between the twins’ bodies may range from fairly simple to very complex. Both children may have all the organs and other structures they need, or they may share other structures or vital organs, like their heart. Their bodies may be able to support both their lives, or it may be hard for 1 or both to survive because of health problems. Treatment for each set of twins is unique. Experts from Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will work closely with each other and with you to provide the care you and your twins need before the babies are born and plan for their needs after birth. Before birth and in the months soon after, your twins’ healthcare team will gather as much information as they can about their anatomy and how well their bodies work. The team will use this information to create a detailed treatment plan. The main goal is to give both children the best chance for a good quality of life, whenever possible. Deciding about separation surgery Your twins’ treatment plan may or may not include surgery to separate them. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years – even into adulthood – still physically connected to each other. For conjoined twins, being connected to their sibling is “normal.” Some conjoined twins have happy, healthy, full lives by staying connected. For some twins, separation surgery is too difficult, so staying connected is the only real option. Some conjoined twins do have surgery to be separated, usually in the first 12 months of life. This may be the best option for the physical health of the children, while also giving them the chance to have independent bodies and lives. Separation surgery is sometimes the best option because the twins’ shared organs cannot support both of them. Or it may be the best option because 1 twin is unlikely to survive and separation is the only way to give the other twin a chance to live. Your healthcare team will speak with you about what your twins’ lives may be like whether they are joined or separated. They will help you consider which option is best for your twins. When separation is planned Surgery to separate conjoined twins requires detailed planning whenever possible. To prepare for surgery, your twins will need providers who are experts in many different types of care. They will work together to plan the steps and timing of the surgery and the care your children will need before and after. One doctor will oversee the team and coordinate all parts of the plan. In most cases, doctors will do the separation surgery after your twins are at least 4 months old. This gives their bodies a chance to grow so it’s easier for doctors to do the surgery and easier for the twins to withstand the surgery. This also allows time for the many imaging studies, tests and other procedures that might be needed to learn about your twins’ bodies or prepare them for separation. In some cases, conjoined twins need to be separated before they are 4 months old because of a health emergency or an urgent problem that cannot wait. Often, 2 complete surgery teams work together very closely to separate twins. This can be important to take care of the complex needs of both twins at the same time while they are being separated and right after. Once your twins are separated, each may need additional surgeries to correct some of the anatomic (structural) problems they may have. Follow-up care Your twins will need long-term follow-up visits throughout their childhood and into their early adult years to check their growth and development whether they stay connected or are separated. Most will need surgeries or other types of treatment for health issues that arise over time.

The two boys were placed on a ventilator at birth but doctors said their chances of survival were zero.  The unnamed babies weighed just over eight pounds and had separate lungs and hearts, but hared a liver and a pair of limbs.  Medics said their parents pleaded with them to save the newborns but doctors told the “such kids do not survive”.  The parents pleaded with doctors to save the babies but they died with 24 hours (Caters News Agency)  It would have been impossible to separate them surgically had they survived, doctors said.  Twins born with two heads, but sharing one body, are known as dicephalic parapagus. It affects around one in a million births.  The boys were born on October 29 as Swami Ramanand Tirth hospital in Maharashtra, western India.  The 32-year-old mother asked to remain anonymous in case she was shunned by locals.    Read more     Conjoined twins separated in surgery see each other for first time    The physical issue was discovered in the 32nd week of pregnancy when the woman went for an ultrasound.  Dr Sanjay Bansode, head of the gynaecology department, said that while the babies were in healthy condition in the womb, they would have no chance of survival post-birth.  He said: “The babies were a case of dicephalic parapagus or two-headed twins, which are often stillborn.  “It is extremely rare and happens just one in a lakh [equal to one hundred thousand] and chances of dicephalic parapagus twins are of around 10 per cent of such births.  “Their condition was very critical and they were put on ventilator support. However, a day after birth they died.”  The couple already have three daughters and a son. The doctor added: “They were extremely poor and were nervous after the child's birth.  “The mother did not know she was carrying conjoined twins until the 32nd week of pregnancy. “They asked us to do anything to save the babies but such kids do not survive. There is no possibility of surgery either as they share most of their body parts and in this case had just one pair of limbs.”   More about:  Conjoined twins  India  Reuse content                    INDY/ LIFE Newsletter             Email address  Please enter an email address  Email address is invalid  Email cannot be used.

For other uses, see Siamese twins (disambiguation) .    Conjoined twins    Synonyms  Siamese twins       X-ray of conjoined twins, cephalothoracopagus.    Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

When the bodies of twins connect, they are called conjoined twins. Conjoined twins begin as a single fertilized egg. Usually, a single egg develops into 1 baby. Sometimes a single egg divides in half 1 to 2 weeks after it’s fertilized. This creates a set of identical twins. The exact cause of conjoined twinning is not known. There are 2 theories:  The egg divides late and does not divide completely.  The egg divides completely then it joins back together.    The connection between the twins’ bodies may be fairly simple. They may share only a small amount of tissue, and both children may have all the organs and other structures they need. For example, the twins may be joined at the belly with a “bridge” connecting their livers.  Usually, the connection is more complex. In some cases, children may share:  Vital organs, like 1 heart  Many structures, like several parts of the digestive, genital and urinary systems  A large segment of the body, like all of the lower body  Part of the brain and skull  The twins’ symptoms may depend on which structures they share. Types of Conjoined Twins Doctors group conjoined twins into the following categories based on where they are joined. Joined at the chest This is the most common type of conjoined twins and is called thoracopagus (pronounced thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus). About 40% of all conjoined twins are in this group. These twins are face to face. In about 75% of cases, the twins share a heart. Twins joined at the chest may also share a liver, biliary tract (which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine) and upper digestive tract (esophagus, stomach and small intestine). Joined from the breastbone to the waist This type of conjoined twins, called omphalopagus (pronounced om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) or xiphopagus (pronounced xi-phop-a-gus), are face to face. They may share a liver, biliary tract and upper digestive tract. About 34% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the sacrum (lower back) and buttock area This type of conjoined twins, called pygopagus (pronounced pie-GOP-uh-gus), are back to back. They may share part of the lower digestive tract (large intestine, rectum and anus) and part of the skeleton, nervous system and genitals. About 18% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined in the pelvic area, possibly up to the breastbone This type of conjoined twins, called ischiopagus (pronounced is-kee-OP-uh-gus), may be oriented to each other in different ways. In general, they partly face each other. They may share a liver and biliary tract, part of the upper and all of the lower digestive tract, the genital and urinary systems and part of the skeleton. About 6% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the head This type of conjoined twins, called craniopagus (pronounced kray-nee-OP-uh-gus), may share a skull, brain and other parts of the nervous system. About 2% of conjoined twins are in this group. Outlook for Conjoined Twins About 40% of conjoined twins are not alive when they are delivered (stillborn). About 35% die within a day after they are born. Although most sets of conjoined twins do not survive because their organs cannot support them, more conjoined twins survive now than in the past. Advances in imaging, surgical techniques and anesthesia have helped improve chances for survival. We also have tools to detect their condition before birth so families and doctors can plan their care before they are born. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years while conjoined, sometimes even into adulthood. Others may need to be separated by surgery. The success of the separation surgery depends on many factors, mainly where the twins are connected and which structures they share. In many cases, both twins survive after surgery. In some cases, only 1 survives because the other doesn’t have the organs they need or the organs are not well developed. Sometimes neither child survives. Conjoined Twins at Seattle Children’s Seattle Children’s provides complete care to meet all of the healthcare needs of conjoined twins from birth through childhood and into the early adult years. This may include surgery to separate the twins. Our team has the knowledge, experience and facilities to perform separation surgeries – and to provide care for conjoined twins who cannot be separated or whose family decides not to separate them. Separation is not the only choice for these children. Some parents may choose not to have the surgery even though their children could be separated. You will meet with a team of doctors to talk about your twins, including the benefits and risks of having surgery and of not being separated. Our goal is to help you understand your twins’ health and all your options so you can make the choices that are best for your family. The experts you need are here Seattle Children’s is a national leader in successful surgery for conjoined twins. We base treatment plans on years of experience and the newest research on what works best – and most safely – for children and teens. This experience helps us work with you to decide on the best treatment. Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. Your child and family get support Many types of healthcare providers are needed to assess your twins’ condition and plan and carry out their treatment. Along with your children’s surgeons, you are connected with doctors trained to care for new babies with complex problems ( neonatologists ), nurses, dietitians , child life specialists , social workers and others. We work together to meet all of your children’s health needs and help your family through this experience. Conjoined Twins Symptoms Conjoined twins may be connected to each other in many different ways. Their health and any symptoms depend on how each child developed, which structures they share and how well their organs work. Most conjoined twins are born early (premature). This means their lungs have probably not finished developing and breathing problems are common. Conjoined Twins Diagnosis In most cases, doctors see that twins are conjoined during a routine ultrasound late in the first trimester of pregnancy or in the second trimester. Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program provides care for pregnant women and their conjoined twins. Each set of conjoined twins is unique. Decisions about their care are complex and often hard for their families and their healthcare providers. The chance for survival is an important factor in these decisions. Another important factor is the quality of life for the twins if they stay conjoined or are separated. Before delivery Once your doctor can see where the twins are joined by ultrasound, the doctor will have more information on the structures the twins may share. Other imaging studies can also take pictures of the twins before birth. They include ultrasound, echocardiography and prenatal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) . Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. We will perform the imaging studies and explain what the images show. You can consult with Seattle Children’s doctors who care for conjoined twins about what to expect, including whether separation is possible. Some parents continue their pregnancy. Others decide to end their pregnancy. For parents continuing their pregnancy, doctors will suggest careful monitoring and planning. This helps the healthcare team prepare for the diagnostic tests and provide the treatments the twins may need once they are born. Prenatal care of conjoined twins usually includes scheduling delivery by cesarean section (C-section) a month before the twins’ due date. This is because a vaginal birth is too hard for the mother and babies. During and after delivery After delivery by C-section, the twins will likely need many types of imaging studies and tests to learn as much as possible about how they are connected and their overall health. This information will help you and the healthcare team decide how to care for the twins. Studies and tests your babies need will depend on where the twins are joined and their health. A few of the common tests for conjoined twins are:   Heart tests, such as echocardiography and electrocardiography  Ultrasound  CT (computed tomography) scan   Conjoined Twins Treatment The treatment that conjoined twins may need depends on the health of each twin and where and how they are joined. Creating a treatment plan The connection between the twins’ bodies may range from fairly simple to very complex. Both children may have all the organs and other structures they need, or they may share other structures or vital organs, like their heart. Their bodies may be able to support both their lives, or it may be hard for 1 or both to survive because of health problems. Treatment for each set of twins is unique. Experts from Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will work closely with each other and with you to provide the care you and your twins need before the babies are born and plan for their needs after birth. Before birth and in the months soon after, your twins’ healthcare team will gather as much information as they can about their anatomy and how well their bodies work. The team will use this information to create a detailed treatment plan. The main goal is to give both children the best chance for a good quality of life, whenever possible. Deciding about separation surgery Your twins’ treatment plan may or may not include surgery to separate them. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years – even into adulthood – still physically connected to each other. For conjoined twins, being connected to their sibling is “normal.” Some conjoined twins have happy, healthy, full lives by staying connected. For some twins, separation surgery is too difficult, so staying connected is the only real option. Some conjoined twins do have surgery to be separated, usually in the first 12 months of life. This may be the best option for the physical health of the children, while also giving them the chance to have independent bodies and lives. Separation surgery is sometimes the best option because the twins’ shared organs cannot support both of them. Or it may be the best option because 1 twin is unlikely to survive and separation is the only way to give the other twin a chance to live. Your healthcare team will speak with you about what your twins’ lives may be like whether they are joined or separated. They will help you consider which option is best for your twins. When separation is planned Surgery to separate conjoined twins requires detailed planning whenever possible. To prepare for surgery, your twins will need providers who are experts in many different types of care. They will work together to plan the steps and timing of the surgery and the care your children will need before and after. One doctor will oversee the team and coordinate all parts of the plan. In most cases, doctors will do the separation surgery after your twins are at least 4 months old. This gives their bodies a chance to grow so it’s easier for doctors to do the surgery and easier for the twins to withstand the surgery. This also allows time for the many imaging studies, tests and other procedures that might be needed to learn about your twins’ bodies or prepare them for separation. In some cases, conjoined twins need to be separated before they are 4 months old because of a health emergency or an urgent problem that cannot wait. Often, 2 complete surgery teams work together very closely to separate twins. This can be important to take care of the complex needs of both twins at the same time while they are being separated and right after. Once your twins are separated, each may need additional surgeries to correct some of the anatomic (structural) problems they may have. Follow-up care Your twins will need long-term follow-up visits throughout their childhood and into their early adult years to check their growth and development whether they stay connected or are separated. Most will need surgeries or other types of treatment for health issues that arise over time.

Conjoined Twins (less commonly referred to as Siamese Twins following the birth of Chang and Eng Bunker in Siam), are genetically identical, develop from the same egg, and often share vital human organs and limbs. Abby and Brittany Hensel are about to be the United States' most famous conjoined twins. Their lives "Abby & Brittany," will be featured in a documentary series airing Tuesday, Sept. 28 at 10 p.m. on TLC . Here's a quick look at their story, plus the stories of nine pairs who've made history around the world. 10. Abby and Brittany Hensel Abby and Brittany Hensel were born in 1990. Their parents were told they probably wouldn't survive the night, but 22 years later, the two are off to college. Their case is rare; they have two hearts, two sets of lungs, and two separate brains. One controls the right side of the body, the other the left side, but the two move together, have two drivers licenses, ride a bike, and navigate the daily lives of 20somethings with ease. Since they were born, the two have been featured in magazines and talk shows.    Chang and Eng Bunker  http://jilltracy.com      9. Chang and Eng Bunker Chang and Eng Bunker were born in 1811 in Siam (now Thailand). Their livers were fused together and could have easily been separated with modern medicine, but since the operation was much more difficult in their time, the two remained conjoined. Like many conjoined twins, they toured the world as entertainers and made money as spectacles and medical wonders. Eventually, the two married sisters, settled in North Carolina, and had more than 20 children.    Daisy and Violet Hilton  http://afflictor.com      8. Daisy and Violet Hilton The Hilton Sisters were born in 1908. Their 19-year-old mother worked in a bar and sold the twins to her boss, who toured them around the world. They gained recognition in Germany, the U.S. and Australia and tap danced in a Bob Hope act. They gained independence in 1931 and went into vaudeville, where they dubbed themselves the Hilton Sisters. After performing, marrying, and divorcing, they ended up in Florida, where they had a hamburger stand. The sisters ended up in North Carolina after a public appearance (their tour manager ditched them there), and ended up with a gig at a grocery store until they died in 1969.    Lori and George Schappell  http://www.click.ro      7. Lori and George Schappell Lori and George (originally named Dori) were born in 1961, conjoined at the head. They share 30 percent of their brain matter. They grew up in an institution in Pennsylvania, but were released in their 20s. Under the stage name Reba Schappell (after Reba McEntire), George has performed internationally singing country music, has won an L.A. Music Award for Best New Country Artist, and sang a track for Hollywood film Stuck on You . Dori lives a quieter life, has a gig doing laundry at a hospital and works around George's music schedule. In 2006, George was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and declared a year later that he identifies as a male and permanently changed his name. The two are still living in    Ronnie and Donnie Galyon  http://oddculture.com      6. Donnie and Ronnie Galyon Donnie and Ronnie Gaylon currently hold the Guinness world record for the oldest living conjoined twins. They were born in Ohio in 1951 and are joined from the groin to the sternum, sharing all male organs. They were abandoned by their mother and raised by their father and stepmother. They were toured around the US and Latin America, where they made enough money to support their family as side show acts for more than 30 years. They still make television appearances and live in Ohio.    Eliza (or Elisa) and Mary Chalkhurst  http://phreeque.tripod.com      5. Eliza and Mary Chalkhurst The Chalkhursts were one of the first documented cases of conjoined twins when they were born in England in 1100. Most illustrations depict the two joined at the hip, though some picture the two joined at the shoulder as well. Eliza and Mary lived until 1136, and left money and land to be distributed to the poor in their village.    Millie and Christine McCoy  wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/MillieandChristineMcCoy(1873).jpg      4. Millie and Christine McCoy Millie and Christine McCoy were born in 1851 to parents who were slaves in North Carolina. They were sold to multiple showmen at a young age and traveled under the name "The Two-Headed Nightingale" until they were kidnapped by another showman and taken to the United Kingdom. There, the McCoy's kidnapper was forced to release the girls back to one of their original showmen since slavery had been outlawed in the UK. Millie and Christine were reunited with their mother and were raised to speak five languages, dance, and sing. They toured with the Barnum circus and made public appearances before retiring and living until they were 61.    Krista and Tatiana Hogan  coolpicturegallery.net      3. Krista and Tatiana Hogan Krista Hogan and Tatiana Hogan were born in 2006 in Vancouver, Canada. The two are joined at the head and share a thalamus, which connects their brainstems enabling the two to share brain signals, emotions, and thoughts. Research also confirmed that the two share visual cortex signals, so the two can actually experience what the other twin is seeing. The two have had a series of health issues and associated surgeries, but are currently doing well and making occasional television appearances.    Ladan and Laleh Bijani  http://www.transporting.to      2. Ladan and Laleh Bijani Ladan and Laleh Bijani were born in Iran in 1979 and were lost in the hospital after the doctor responsible for them fled for the United States during the Islamic Revolution. They were raised by Dr. Alireza Safaian, who the girls chose to stay with even when they were reconnected with their natural parents years later. Ladan and Laleh had very different personalities and often struggled on what they wanted to do with their lives. One wanted to go to law school, the other wanted to go to school for journalism; one was very outgoing and the other shy. Since they were children, they wanted to be separated, but since the two were joined at the head, most doctors refused to perform the surgery since it was so dangerous. In 2002, the two met with a neurosurgeon from Singapore who had separated conjoined twins joined at the head before. He warned the two that the surgery was very risky, but Ladan and Laleh insisted. More than 28 surgeons and 100 hospital staff members performed the operation, but after complications following the separation and a large amount of blood loss, the two died hours later.

Giacomo and Giovanni Battista The Tocci brothers were born in Italy in 1877. They were joined at the waist and shared an abdomen, pelvis, and legs. The brothers were given to the The Royal Academy of Medicine in Turin when they were a month old, and were toured, studied, and put on exhibition throughout the U.S. and Europe as the "Two-Headed Boy." The two were reportedly never able to coordinate their movements (one controlled the left leg, the other, the right leg), and were wheelchair bound for the rest of their lives. They retired after 20 years of touring, married sisters, and lived in seclusion in Italy. Follow Jackalope Ranch on Facebook , Twitter and Pinterest .

Sarah Barness     Mar 05, 2015                     Most people don't think twice about performing seemingly simple tasks like walking down the street, getting in the car or going for a dip in the pool. But for Ohio twins, Ronnie and Donnie, every activity, from the biggest to the very smallest, is an amazing feat of effort, cooperation and compromise.      At 64 years old, Ronnie and Donnie Galyon are the world's oldest living conjoined twins.             Previously, Italian conjoined twins Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci , who were born in 1877 and lived until the age of 63, held the record.      But now, Ronnie and Donnie have taken the record, much to the surprise of family members and medical professionals.      Their younger brother Jim, told Nine Lives Media 1 that when Ronnie and Donnie were born in 1951, doctors didn't even expect them to make it through the night. But over six decades later, they are still thriving.      "They're one body, but very much two human beings," says Jim of his two brothers.             The twins have four arms, four legs and share a lower digestive tract and pelvic area . They've spent every waking moment with each other, face-to-face, but have never known any other way of life. ABC News reports the twins "performed in circus and sideshow acts" before retiring in 1991 in the Dayton area.      Now, with Jim's help, the twins can relax at home and go about their daily routine.             MLive.com notes that a customized bed from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital has also greatly helped the twins, allowing them to sleep better and improving their "health and quality of life." The brothers' sister-in-law, Mary Galyon, told MLive.com that this bed has been a huge factor as to why the twins have made it this far.      Though their customized bed and family support has helped them pull through, their love for each other has ultimately been most important.       imgur.com       To learn more about Ronnie and Donnie, watch this video:           Like this story?

These conjoined twins are joined at the chest (thoracopagus). They have separate hearts but share other organs.     Conjoined twins are two babies who are born physically connected to each other.  Conjoined twins develop when an early embryo only partially separates to form two individuals. Although two fetuses will develop from this embryo, they will remain physically connected — most often at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Conjoined twins may also share one or more internal organs.  Many conjoined twins die in the womb (stillborn) or die shortly after birth. Some surviving conjoined twins can be surgically separated. The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team.          Symptoms There are no specific signs or symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than with a single fetus, and there may be more fatigue, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using standard ultrasound.  How twins are joined  Conjoined twins are typically classified according to where they're joined, usually at matching sites, and sometimes at more than one site. They sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. The specific anatomy of each pair of conjoined twins is unique.  Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites:   Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins.  Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver, and some share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and colon. They generally do not share a heart.  Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal tract, and a few share the genital and urinary organs.  Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare.  Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs.  Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the abdomen and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs.  Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue.  Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the face and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.   In rare cases, twins may be asymmetrically conjoined, with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Identical twins (monozygotic twins) occur when a single fertilized egg splits and develops into two individuals. Eight to 12 days after conception, the embryonic layers that will split to form monozygotic twins begin to develop into specific organs and structures.  It's believed that when the embryo splits later than this — usually between 13 and 15 days after conception — separation stops before the process is complete, and the resulting twins are conjoined.  An alternative theory suggests that two separate embryos may somehow fuse together in early development.  What might cause either scenario to occur is unknown.  Risk factors Because conjoined twins are so rare, and the cause isn't clear, it's unknown what might make some couples more likely to have conjoined twins.  Complications Conjoined twins must be delivered by cesarean section. Many conjoined twins are stillborn or die shortly after birth. Not all surviving twins are candidates for separation surgery. The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team.

Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail Giving birth to multiples is rare, and even more so identical ones, but it’s far rarer without in vitro fertilization (IVF). A mom in Texas defied one in 50 million odds by giving birth to identical female triplets , including conjoined twins at the pelvis. Silvia Hernandez, husband Raul Torres, and son Raul Jr. welcomed the birth of Catalina and conjoined twins Ximena and Scarlett at Corpus Christi Medical Center just a few days earlier than expected.    Torres and son Raul Jr. at the hospital with Hernandez showing ultrasound images of the identical female triplets.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook  The family was thrilled they were expecting triplets, but happiness quickly turned into fear when they soon learned two of them were conjoined. "The truth is I cried, not because of how the babies would look because we knew we would do our best to give them the best and most productive life posible [sic], I cried because the doctor said we had to understand and accept the fact that once they were born they could die," wrote Hernandez on the Facebook page “ Siamese Triplets Hernandez Torres .”    Ultrasound of identical female triplets, including conjoined twins.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres  The triplets were born just shy of 34 weeks and all weigh 4 pounds and 11 ounces. The birth of triplets is more common with IVF treatment, whereas conceiving identical triplets, also known as trizygotic triplets, is naturally extremely rare. The odds of having identical triplets are one in 60,000 to one in 200 million. Moreover, only one in six triplet pregnancies lead to the birth of three babies of the same sex. The Texas family continued to beat the odds with two out of three identical triplets born conjoined. These twins are genetically identical and always the same sex. Conjoined twins are also only live births one in every 200,000, with a few surviving past day one, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center . This means the odds of naturally conceiving identical female triplets, two of them conjoined, is about one in a 50 million occurrence.    Conjoined twins Scarlett and Ximena at the hospital.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook   Hernandez had a difficult pregnancy anticipating the arrival of the triplets. Torres felt compelled to leave his job to take care of his wife and their 3-year-old son. “Sometimes she couldn't even walk, stand up, go to the bathroom take a shower or anything," Raul told Kiii News .    Raul holding single identical female triplet Catalina.  Siamese Triplets Hernanadez Torres/Facebook   The family has started a GoFundMe page for financial assistance on paying the babies’ medical bills. The small conjoined babies must undergo surgery within six months to a year before they can be separated. Despite medical expenses and a tough future that waits the Texas family, Torres sees these girls as his “miracle babies.” “It's like a gift of God,” he told Kiii News. “God chose us for a reason, to take care of them. He sent us little angels for a reason, so it's a big blessing for us.” The conjoined twins are now being cared for at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Conjoined twins    Synonyms  Siamese twins       X-ray of conjoined twins, cephalothoracopagus.    Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

In the fourth season of the American television series American Horror Story , American Horror Story: Freak Show , the main character Bette and Dot Tattler ( Sarah Paulson ) are conjoined twin sisters ( dicephalic parapagus —two heads side by side on one torso).  In season two, episode eight of Rick and Morty , Michael and Pichael Thompson are depicted as conjoined twins hosting separate TV shows at the same time.  In the Cirque Du Soleil show Kurios: Cabinetes des Curiosities , a pair of conjoined twins are among the Seeker's collection. They later split during an aerial straps duo , and reunite for the rest of the show.  The film Charulatha stars Priyamani as a conjoined twin.  In the movie Jagga Jasoos , starring Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif , Basheer Alexander is shown with two heads.  On the television series Ruby Gloom , the characters Frank and Len are conjoined twins who comprise a rock group called RIP.  In the film Monsters University , two of the members of fictitious fraternity Oozma Kappa are named Terri and Terry Perry.  In the children's cartoon Steven Universe , the Rutile twins are conjoined.   See also [ edit ]   Medical law  Monoamniotic twins  Polycephaly   References [ edit ]    ^  "Conjoined Twins Facts" .

Specialty  Medical genetics     Conjoined twins are identical twins [1] joined in utero . An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa. [2] Approximately half are stillborn , and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1. [2] [3]  Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission , in which the fertilized egg splits partially. [4] The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, [4] is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion , placenta , and amniotic sac , although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero . [5]  The most famous pair of conjoined twins was Chang and Eng Bunker (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811–1874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand . They traveled with P.T. Barnum 's circus for many years and were labeled as the Siamese twins . Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated. [6] Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.

The most common types of conjoined twins are:   Thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of cases): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system . [8]  Thoracopagus (18.5%): [4] Two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. The heart is always involved in these cases. [8] As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.  Omphalopagus (10%): [4] Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a liver , digestive system , diaphragm and other organs. [8]  Parasitic twins (10%): [4] Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.  Craniopagus (6%): [4] Fused skulls , but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull. [8]   Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:   Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus ) or syncephalus. [8]  Syncephalus : One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies. [8]  Cephalothoracopagus : Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull. [8] [9]  Xiphopagus : Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage , which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. [8] A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker .  Ischiopagus : Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of genitalia and anus . [8]  Omphalo-Ischiopagus : Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs. [8]  Parapagus : Fused side-by-side with a shared pelvis . Twins that are dithoracic parapagus are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are diprosopic parapagus have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are dicephalic parapagus have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. [8]  Craniopagus parasiticus : Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.  Pygopagus (Iliopagus) : Two bodies joined at the pelvis . [8]  Rachipagus : Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks [10]   Causes [ edit ]  Embryo splitting in which zygote divide agamically, to produce identical children, is blocked by mitosis inhibitor . [ citation needed ]  Management [ edit ]  Separation [ edit ]  Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. [11]  Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.  The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later. [12] [13] The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. [14] In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) [15] and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. [16] [17] [18] The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired. [19]  In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. [20] Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society. [21]  Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal , in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore ; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. [22] The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection. [23]  Infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in Great Britain by court order Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November, 2000, at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester . The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. [24] [25] Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood. [26]  In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani , who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. [27] The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.  History [ edit ]     Conjoined brothers from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Conjoined twin sisters from Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)       Moche ceramics depicting conjoined twins. 300 CE Larco Museum Collection Lima, Peru.    The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. [28] Writing around 415 CE, St. Augustine of Hippo , in his book, City of God , refers to a man "double in his upper, but single in his lower half--having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man." [29]  In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and 'Abd Shams were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai , separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). [30] The Muslim  polymath  Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book Kitab-al-Saidana . [31]  The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst , who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny , Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent ; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia , born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.     Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near Mt. Airy, North Carolina    Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts , though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman , J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis , 17 hours apart.  Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from Locana , Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain 's short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.

When the bodies of twins connect, they are called conjoined twins. Conjoined twins begin as a single fertilized egg. Usually, a single egg develops into 1 baby. Sometimes a single egg divides in half 1 to 2 weeks after it’s fertilized. This creates a set of identical twins. The exact cause of conjoined twinning is not known. There are 2 theories:  The egg divides late and does not divide completely.  The egg divides completely then it joins back together.    The connection between the twins’ bodies may be fairly simple. They may share only a small amount of tissue, and both children may have all the organs and other structures they need. For example, the twins may be joined at the belly with a “bridge” connecting their livers.  Usually, the connection is more complex. In some cases, children may share:  Vital organs, like 1 heart  Many structures, like several parts of the digestive, genital and urinary systems  A large segment of the body, like all of the lower body  Part of the brain and skull  The twins’ symptoms may depend on which structures they share. Types of Conjoined Twins Doctors group conjoined twins into the following categories based on where they are joined. Joined at the chest This is the most common type of conjoined twins and is called thoracopagus (pronounced thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus). About 40% of all conjoined twins are in this group. These twins are face to face. In about 75% of cases, the twins share a heart. Twins joined at the chest may also share a liver, biliary tract (which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine) and upper digestive tract (esophagus, stomach and small intestine). Joined from the breastbone to the waist This type of conjoined twins, called omphalopagus (pronounced om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) or xiphopagus (pronounced xi-phop-a-gus), are face to face. They may share a liver, biliary tract and upper digestive tract. About 34% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the sacrum (lower back) and buttock area This type of conjoined twins, called pygopagus (pronounced pie-GOP-uh-gus), are back to back. They may share part of the lower digestive tract (large intestine, rectum and anus) and part of the skeleton, nervous system and genitals. About 18% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined in the pelvic area, possibly up to the breastbone This type of conjoined twins, called ischiopagus (pronounced is-kee-OP-uh-gus), may be oriented to each other in different ways. In general, they partly face each other. They may share a liver and biliary tract, part of the upper and all of the lower digestive tract, the genital and urinary systems and part of the skeleton. About 6% of conjoined twins are in this group. Joined at the head This type of conjoined twins, called craniopagus (pronounced kray-nee-OP-uh-gus), may share a skull, brain and other parts of the nervous system. About 2% of conjoined twins are in this group. Outlook for Conjoined Twins About 40% of conjoined twins are not alive when they are delivered (stillborn). About 35% die within a day after they are born. Although most sets of conjoined twins do not survive because their organs cannot support them, more conjoined twins survive now than in the past. Advances in imaging, surgical techniques and anesthesia have helped improve chances for survival. We also have tools to detect their condition before birth so families and doctors can plan their care before they are born. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years while conjoined, sometimes even into adulthood. Others may need to be separated by surgery. The success of the separation surgery depends on many factors, mainly where the twins are connected and which structures they share. In many cases, both twins survive after surgery. In some cases, only 1 survives because the other doesn’t have the organs they need or the organs are not well developed. Sometimes neither child survives. Conjoined Twins at Seattle Children’s Seattle Children’s provides complete care to meet all of the healthcare needs of conjoined twins from birth through childhood and into the early adult years. This may include surgery to separate the twins. Our team has the knowledge, experience and facilities to perform separation surgeries – and to provide care for conjoined twins who cannot be separated or whose family decides not to separate them. Separation is not the only choice for these children. Some parents may choose not to have the surgery even though their children could be separated. You will meet with a team of doctors to talk about your twins, including the benefits and risks of having surgery and of not being separated. Our goal is to help you understand your twins’ health and all your options so you can make the choices that are best for your family. The experts you need are here Seattle Children’s is a national leader in successful surgery for conjoined twins. We base treatment plans on years of experience and the newest research on what works best – and most safely – for children and teens. This experience helps us work with you to decide on the best treatment. Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. Your child and family get support Many types of healthcare providers are needed to assess your twins’ condition and plan and carry out their treatment. Along with your children’s surgeons, you are connected with doctors trained to care for new babies with complex problems ( neonatologists ), nurses, dietitians , child life specialists , social workers and others. We work together to meet all of your children’s health needs and help your family through this experience. Conjoined Twins Symptoms Conjoined twins may be connected to each other in many different ways. Their health and any symptoms depend on how each child developed, which structures they share and how well their organs work. Most conjoined twins are born early (premature). This means their lungs have probably not finished developing and breathing problems are common. Conjoined Twins Diagnosis In most cases, doctors see that twins are conjoined during a routine ultrasound late in the first trimester of pregnancy or in the second trimester. Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program provides care for pregnant women and their conjoined twins. Each set of conjoined twins is unique. Decisions about their care are complex and often hard for their families and their healthcare providers. The chance for survival is an important factor in these decisions. Another important factor is the quality of life for the twins if they stay conjoined or are separated. Before delivery Once your doctor can see where the twins are joined by ultrasound, the doctor will have more information on the structures the twins may share. Other imaging studies can also take pictures of the twins before birth. They include ultrasound, echocardiography and prenatal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) . Prior to the birth of your twins, Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will help you get ready for the birth and plan the steps ahead, which may include separation surgery. We will perform the imaging studies and explain what the images show. You can consult with Seattle Children’s doctors who care for conjoined twins about what to expect, including whether separation is possible. Some parents continue their pregnancy. Others decide to end their pregnancy. For parents continuing their pregnancy, doctors will suggest careful monitoring and planning. This helps the healthcare team prepare for the diagnostic tests and provide the treatments the twins may need once they are born. Prenatal care of conjoined twins usually includes scheduling delivery by cesarean section (C-section) a month before the twins’ due date. This is because a vaginal birth is too hard for the mother and babies. During and after delivery After delivery by C-section, the twins will likely need many types of imaging studies and tests to learn as much as possible about how they are connected and their overall health. This information will help you and the healthcare team decide how to care for the twins. Studies and tests your babies need will depend on where the twins are joined and their health. A few of the common tests for conjoined twins are:   Heart tests, such as echocardiography and electrocardiography  Ultrasound  CT (computed tomography) scan   Conjoined Twins Treatment The treatment that conjoined twins may need depends on the health of each twin and where and how they are joined. Creating a treatment plan The connection between the twins’ bodies may range from fairly simple to very complex. Both children may have all the organs and other structures they need, or they may share other structures or vital organs, like their heart. Their bodies may be able to support both their lives, or it may be hard for 1 or both to survive because of health problems. Treatment for each set of twins is unique. Experts from Seattle Children’s Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment Program will work closely with each other and with you to provide the care you and your twins need before the babies are born and plan for their needs after birth. Before birth and in the months soon after, your twins’ healthcare team will gather as much information as they can about their anatomy and how well their bodies work. The team will use this information to create a detailed treatment plan. The main goal is to give both children the best chance for a good quality of life, whenever possible. Deciding about separation surgery Your twins’ treatment plan may or may not include surgery to separate them. Some conjoined twins live for days, weeks, months or years – even into adulthood – still physically connected to each other. For conjoined twins, being connected to their sibling is “normal.” Some conjoined twins have happy, healthy, full lives by staying connected. For some twins, separation surgery is too difficult, so staying connected is the only real option. Some conjoined twins do have surgery to be separated, usually in the first 12 months of life. This may be the best option for the physical health of the children, while also giving them the chance to have independent bodies and lives. Separation surgery is sometimes the best option because the twins’ shared organs cannot support both of them. Or it may be the best option because 1 twin is unlikely to survive and separation is the only way to give the other twin a chance to live. Your healthcare team will speak with you about what your twins’ lives may be like whether they are joined or separated. They will help you consider which option is best for your twins. When separation is planned Surgery to separate conjoined twins requires detailed planning whenever possible. To prepare for surgery, your twins will need providers who are experts in many different types of care. They will work together to plan the steps and timing of the surgery and the care your children will need before and after. One doctor will oversee the team and coordinate all parts of the plan. In most cases, doctors will do the separation surgery after your twins are at least 4 months old. This gives their bodies a chance to grow so it’s easier for doctors to do the surgery and easier for the twins to withstand the surgery. This also allows time for the many imaging studies, tests and other procedures that might be needed to learn about your twins’ bodies or prepare them for separation. In some cases, conjoined twins need to be separated before they are 4 months old because of a health emergency or an urgent problem that cannot wait. Often, 2 complete surgery teams work together very closely to separate twins. This can be important to take care of the complex needs of both twins at the same time while they are being separated and right after. Once your twins are separated, each may need additional surgeries to correct some of the anatomic (structural) problems they may have. Follow-up care Your twins will need long-term follow-up visits throughout their childhood and into their early adult years to check their growth and development whether they stay connected or are separated. Most will need surgeries or other types of treatment for health issues that arise over time.

The two boys were placed on a ventilator at birth but doctors said their chances of survival were zero.  The unnamed babies weighed just over eight pounds and had separate lungs and hearts, but hared a liver and a pair of limbs.  Medics said their parents pleaded with them to save the newborns but doctors told the “such kids do not survive”.  The parents pleaded with doctors to save the babies but they died with 24 hours (Caters News Agency)  It would have been impossible to separate them surgically had they survived, doctors said.  Twins born with two heads, but sharing one body, are known as dicephalic parapagus. It affects around one in a million births.  The boys were born on October 29 as Swami Ramanand Tirth hospital in Maharashtra, western India.  The 32-year-old mother asked to remain anonymous in case she was shunned by locals.    Read more     Conjoined twins separated in surgery see each other for first time    The physical issue was discovered in the 32nd week of pregnancy when the woman went for an ultrasound.  Dr Sanjay Bansode, head of the gynaecology department, said that while the babies were in healthy condition in the womb, they would have no chance of survival post-birth.  He said: “The babies were a case of dicephalic parapagus or two-headed twins, which are often stillborn.  “It is extremely rare and happens just one in a lakh [equal to one hundred thousand] and chances of dicephalic parapagus twins are of around 10 per cent of such births.  “Their condition was very critical and they were put on ventilator support. However, a day after birth they died.”  The couple already have three daughters and a son. The doctor added: “They were extremely poor and were nervous after the child's birth.  “The mother did not know she was carrying conjoined twins until the 32nd week of pregnancy. “They asked us to do anything to save the babies but such kids do not survive. There is no possibility of surgery either as they share most of their body parts and in this case had just one pair of limbs.”   More about:  Conjoined twins  India  Reuse content                    INDY/ LIFE Newsletter             Email address  Please enter an email address  Email address is invalid  Email cannot be used.
