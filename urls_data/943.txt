I am wondering though, as a solo miner, what are the odds of discovering a new block? I guess this depends on my hardware but if we say that a GPU is 10 times faster than a CPU, and a $10 USB ASIC device is 1000 times faster than a CPU, and a $300 mining box is 5000 times faster than a CPU, perhaps one can adjust the odds estimations to reflect that.  Also, how many BTC would I obtain if I discovered a block?

Answer depends on time period of mining. – blogger  Nov 5 '13 at 2:09         1      When I signed up for btcguild today, I found that blocks were frequently being discovered. One every few minutes. But they have zillions of hashes per second going on. – Friendly  Nov 5 '13 at 2:16        1      Related question: bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/16687/… – Isac  Sep 10 '15 at 8:47        add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  16  down vote  accepted      Take the total network Th/s and divide by your total Th/s. That number gives you you a number that tells you how many blocks will occur before you get one (on average).  So if there is currently 3,666 Th/s on the network, and you have a 0.55 Th/s (like you would if you have a $5,000 KNCMiner Jupiter ASIC), then 3,666/0.55 = 6,665.  That means you have 1/6,665ths of total hashing capacity.   There will be 6,665 blocks before you get one.  So if there are 144 blocks in a day, then you need to wait 46.28 days to get a block when mining solowith that hardware.  But that is assuming difficulty doesn't rise.   So what will happen with a rising difficulty is you end up waiting much longer even, and possibly never end up getting a block when solo mining.  That's why solo mining is not as profitable as using a pool for anyone without tens of Th/s nowadays.     share | improve this answer      edited Nov 10 '13 at 14:35             answered Nov 5 '13 at 4:04       Stephen Gornick   23.6k 7 48 128              3      Or in the case of a USB miner, which mines maybe 5 GH/s, it would be 4600 days or 12.5 years. And with a CPU miner the chances are 1000 times worse, i.e. infitesimal. So really without good hardware this is like playing the lottery. – Friendly  Nov 5 '13 at 4:22         1      note that the p of {finding a block in X blocks when your chance of mining a block in one unit of time is 1/x} = (1-(6664/6665)^6665) is about .632, so you would actually only need to be mining for about 4605 blocks with .5 probability. Now that the difficulty is about 600 times harder, this is probably a moot point. – hedgedandlevered  Aug 20 '14 at 1:27         add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      To answer your question of:   how many BTC would I obtain if I discovered a block?   25 BTC in a single block currently. This will change over time as less and less BTC are available to mine  Here is an excerpt from bitcoin wiki :   How are new bitcoins created?  New bitcoins are generated by the network through the process of "mining". In a process that is similar to a continuous raffle draw, mining nodes on the network are awarded bitcoins each time they find the solution to a certain mathematical problem (and thereby create a new block). Creating a block is a proof of work with a difficulty that varies with the overall strength of the network. The reward for solving a block is automatically adjusted so that, ideally, every four years of operation of the Bitcoin network, half the amount of bitcoins created in the prior 4 years are created. A maximum of 10,499,889.80231183 bitcoins were created in the first 4 (approx.) years from January 2009 to November 2012. Every four years thereafter this amount halves, so it should be 5,250,000 over years 4-8, 2,625,000 over years 8-12, and so on. Thus, the total number of bitcoins in existence can never exceed 20,999,839.77085749 and counting. See Controlled Currency Supply.  Blocks are mined every 10 minutes, on average and for the first four years (210,000 blocks) each block included 50 new bitcoins. As the amount of processing power directed at mining changes, the difficulty of creating new bitcoins changes. This difficulty factor is calculated every 2016 blocks and is based upon the time taken to generate the previous 2016 blocks.   This is a great place to start reading about bitcoins (coindesk)     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 9 '15 at 14:34       Corey Trombley   21 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      To answer you question about what is the reward for mining a valid block. Currently 25 BTC, previously it was 50 BTC until block number 210,000 was mined. The current amount will be divided by 2 when block number 420,000 is mined.  That said the fluctuation in amounts you see on mined blocks is the transaction fees. When people send bitcoin they have choice to include a mining fee (to get better chance of getting in next block faster than other transactions). Depending on the transactions your miner decide to include you will get more or less bitcoin plus the base reward of 25 BTC. So normally miners that wants to cut a profit will favorite transaction with bigger fee.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 10 '15 at 14:48       Gopoi   744 4 20              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The difficulty changing won't preclude you from finding a block. However because it's essentially random, there's a chance you might never find a block, and also a chance you could find one on the first hash. There's even a chance you could find 10 in a row. It's random, like flipping a fair coin. Each try is also independent, also like flipping a coin. Just because you've flipped the coin 10/ times and it comes up tails, doesn't mean your "due" for it to come up heads. It's still 50/50.     share | improve this answer     answered Jan 17 at 19:58       Michael allen   1              add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  Mar 21 at 16:53   Thank you for your interest in this question.

But then the last block generated US$ 60,900 of bitcoin (14.4BTC).   Would it matter if the farm is in Southern Africa away from anyone, would another miner that is closer always get the block first?   Closer to what? There is no centre. And as blocks take an average of 10 minutes to produce, and they are small (1MB), so while there are race conditions they are the same for everyone everywhere.     share | improve this answer      edited Sep 11 '17 at 18:36             answered Sep 11 '17 at 17:48       weston   359 2 10                  You pretty much answered my questions! :) Don't see anyone disagreeing with it, thanks! – emotality  Sep 12 '17 at 12:51            @emotality cool, click the tick/check mark near the to accept the answer – weston  Sep 12 '17 at 14:18            Note that the quoted hash rate means you will mine an average of one block per month.

They apply a hash function to the block and get back a hash. The hash needs to have some properties, e.g. start with 3 zeros. If it doesn't, the miners change a value in the block (called nonce) and apply the hash function again. The new hash will be different. If it still doesn't start with 3 zeros miners repeat the process until they find a hash that starts with 3 zeros. For more details, please read this to understand the mining process.  A hash function is in itself deterministic. However, the mining process is not. Thus, the answer in the link you provided is wrong. If everyone was trying to mine identical blocks with identical nonces of the same exact order then it might be, in a sense, deterministic but that is not the case.  Everyone has a chance to win (although it is so small that in practice doesn't occur). See here for some examples.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:47       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:19       karask   2,023 1 4 13              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The number of attempts to close a block is probabilistically determined by the law of large numbers. In other words, it is theoretically possible for you to generate at your first try an hashing that meets the target even using your paper and pencil but the probability is very low.  As analogy, if you bet on zero playing at roulette you have 1/36 of chance per try. It turns out that you can win at your first try or most likely you don't. If you repeat the try N times (say 1000 times), you will observe that you will win a number K of bets, where K/N is a random variable that has an expected value of 1/36 . That does NOT mean that your K/N is equal to 1/36 , it means that if you repeat the N sequence again and again you will observe K/N average value will be close to 1/36 .  In the same way, mining a block is like betting on zero on a roulette with many many more numbers (your odds being much much lower) and according to the number of attempts you can do (say per hour) it is probabilistically defined how many blocks you will be likely to close in the same period.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 24 '16 at 10:35             answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:17       Davide C   224 1 4                  Good answer with the analogy.

So, even if one cannot find any information suggesting that someone did, it could have happened.  Blockchain.info gives the current hashing power as 47,289,554.08 GHash/s, so your chance to mine any one block would be 3/47,289,554.0 = 6.3439e-8 .  In Germany there is a popular lottery where you have to guess six out of 49 and one out of ten numbers. The chance of getting all seven numbers right is 7.1511e-8 . So, the probability to win the jackpot is currently as likely as solo-mining a block with 3GHash/s. Of course, the lottery has a bunch of smaller prices for getting it partially right, and the jackpot would be worth millions of Euros, not 25 BTC.  But then, it is cheaper to play "Bitcoin lottery" and the draws are more frequent.  Below an estimate of the chance to get one block out of a day's/year's worth of blocks (disregarding increasing difficulty):   Altogether, it seems to me that regular lottery is more profitable, but then "Playing lottery is a tax for people that are bad at math.".     share | improve this answer     answered Apr 1 '14 at 12:09       Murch ♦   31.7k 25 103 277              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Currently network's capacity is about 41000000 Gh/s.

I will be CPU mining at first, ASIC later on.  I would however like to test my luck. Mostly just for fun, I'm completely fine with the idea of never actually solving a block. I see it more as a lottery. I just want to confirm my idea so that I am not missing something: Do I have a chance of solving a block?  If a block is solved every 10 minutes, and the difficulty goes up continously. Do I even have the time to attempt a solution? I understand that the current work has to be abandoned when a block has been solved, rigth? Is there, for example, a lag here that yields my efforts useless?  What are the odds?

Then the question is, what are your chances and should you do it? I think an analogy with a lottery is apt.  In one week, a lottery might cost you $2 (for one ticket) and give you a 1 in 175 million chance to win $100 million (ignoring smaller prizes, splitting prizes, etc.; complicates things too much). This gives it a return on investment (ROI) of about 29% , so we'll treat this as our baseline: if it's lower than this, it's worse than the lottery and you shouldn't "play".  If you buy a $34.52, 5 GH/s ASIC miner that uses 2.5W of power, you might spend about $0.06 in a week to have a 1 in 13,889 chance to win $11,349. Not counting the upfront investment, this is a 1,361% ROI, so it's worth it. If you factor in the cost of the device (split over a year) and a profitability decline (since the rest of the network will be speeding up), I think you're still looking at an ~80% ROI.  In one week of CPU mining (assuming 20 MH/s at 70 W), you might spend $1.75 in power to have a 1 in 3,472,222 chance to win $11,349. This is a 0.18% ROI, so CPU mining really makes no sense, even as a lottery (it'd be better to just buy a lottery ticket).

E.g. you can't do it with human calculations , because by the time you finish one hash (~9.4 hours), more blocks have been found. If you could do one hash in 1 minute, you'd average 10 hashes per block, maybe wasting ~5% of your effort. I'd estimate 10 minutes per hash as the minimum to participate: you could do approx. 1 hash per block. There is a chance that hash is the right one! You've played the lottery. (any computer is measured in kilohashes per second, at least; many times faster than the minimum) – Tim S.  May 22 '14 at 16:43            @Pacerier note that there is no hard minimum. It's possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that no blocks would be found by the network in the ~10 hours you're calculating a hash by hand, and possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that your hash will meet the target difficulty, and possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that you did not make any mistakes in that 10 hours of arithmetic. However, I'm pointing out that when you get into the range of minutes per hash (or slower), there is an extra limiting factor: blocks have likely been found in the meantime. – Tim S.  May 22 '14 at 16:51            @TimS., Good points, didn't thought of that hard minimum. Btw, that extra limiting factor is actually closer to 3 minutes right? Since we had to factor in the delay of actually getting notified when someone else has won lottery. – Pacerier  May 22 '14 at 16:53         |  show 1 more comment            up vote  7  down vote      I do not think the question was about the "how long" it would take in average, but what are the odds, which is something completely different from my point o view.
If I understand well the concept of solving blocks then there are always more people/groups/pools trying to solve one block.
If that's so then solving a block is always more about the luck than the brute force you have. Even if you have a 1GH rig, you can still find the solution quicker then 1PH pool.
Question is: what are the odds that it will happen?
I would expect a ration : to take place in the answer.
So if the current total H-power is about 7.6PH it means that with 1GH rig you have 1:7600000 probability to solve the block approx. every 8 minutes. Which is 1:116 per a year, if the total H-power does not change and it basically does not depend on the difficulty, as the difficulty is based on total H-power.     share | improve this answer     answered Dec 12 '13 at 7:21       noob   71 1              1      You are correct, the question was about the odds of the asker succeeding in finding a block. However, you can either express the odds as chance per block or as expected time until the outcome will be achieved, Luca has chosen the latter. The 1GH is also highly over-estimating his CPU's mining power, a more realistic value would be less than 0.05 GH/s. So, the odds are more along the line of 1:3320 per year, traded for the energy cost of running the PC at full-blast for a year. – Murch ♦  Dec 12 '13 at 11:37        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      It's better than being in the lottery!  The chance you actually find a block will sadly decrease over time (probably). Thing is, if you're lucky you win the lottery. And if you don't get lucky, you don't win and get nothing.  The advantage of being in a pool is that you play in more lotteries, so your luck averages out . If you get lucky 1% of the time and you try once, you probably won 0% of the time. If you try very often it will tend to balance around 1%.  So, all chance calculations aside, are you feeling lucky?  To answer your question more directly: the long block-intervals (10 minutes) are there to reduce network-lag's influence on people's ability to mine on the newest block. There's some influence, inevitably, but others endure it too. Pools can have a minor advantage if they're close together, but the miners connect through them instead of directly. I think there'd be no difference worth mentioning. Short: Yes, it is your % vs network %.  Small footnote should be made about selfish mining, if another pool is big enough they'll have a mining advantage. Smaller it'd be a disadvantage. It's not being done and I hope pools will stay spread thinly enough to make it ineffective. You can safely ignore this. It also doesn't likely matter when you're "lottery mining" (you're still betting just on your own luck!).  Note: you'll have more luck solo-mining LiteCoin or another GPU/CPU coin.

But with worse hardware it all just depends. – Lodewijk  May 22 '14 at 18:40        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      I'm solo mining AmericanCoin on a US$6/month VPS generating about 7 scrypt kilohashes per second, and just won block 55311 about an hour ago, after about 8 weeks of trying with the random-nonce scrypt-mining script linked to from my blog. so it can be done, if the difficulty is low enough. it might have worked just as well or better with the built-in linear-nonce mining code, but I figured using random numbers would give me an edge in the "luck" department.  here's the current difficulty. when I started it was about 1.9, then went up to about 4 before dropping back.  jcomeau@aspire:~$ americancoind getmininginfo

No matter what statistics are used to calculate the odds of hitting the jackpot, they can never be used to predict the outcome.
As we all can read in the numerous variaties and complications (when it comes to calculating probabilities) in the above mentioned posts, it's obvious that there will never be a mathematical model able to predict the possibilities.
There are too many variables that change continously overtime (diffuclty rate, amount of miners, growing blockchain etc.)
Instead of focussing on mining itself you better try and find a way to reduce the cost. If one could use solar energy to power his/her computer then it's no problem at all to have it up and running up to 20 years or even more. In that case it's cheaper then taking part in a lottery and your chances to hit the pot will be no more or less the same either way. 
That's why we call it luck ;)     share | improve this answer     answered Feb 14 '16 at 14:54       klaas   1              1      Downvoted: "No matter what statistics are used to calculate the odds of hitting the jackpot, they can never be used to predict the outcome.

They apply a hash function to the block and get back a hash. The hash needs to have some properties, e.g. start with 3 zeros. If it doesn't, the miners change a value in the block (called nonce) and apply the hash function again. The new hash will be different. If it still doesn't start with 3 zeros miners repeat the process until they find a hash that starts with 3 zeros. For more details, please read this to understand the mining process.  A hash function is in itself deterministic. However, the mining process is not. Thus, the answer in the link you provided is wrong. If everyone was trying to mine identical blocks with identical nonces of the same exact order then it might be, in a sense, deterministic but that is not the case.  Everyone has a chance to win (although it is so small that in practice doesn't occur). See here for some examples.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:47       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:19       karask   2,023 1 4 13              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The number of attempts to close a block is probabilistically determined by the law of large numbers. In other words, it is theoretically possible for you to generate at your first try an hashing that meets the target even using your paper and pencil but the probability is very low.  As analogy, if you bet on zero playing at roulette you have 1/36 of chance per try. It turns out that you can win at your first try or most likely you don't. If you repeat the try N times (say 1000 times), you will observe that you will win a number K of bets, where K/N is a random variable that has an expected value of 1/36 . That does NOT mean that your K/N is equal to 1/36 , it means that if you repeat the N sequence again and again you will observe K/N average value will be close to 1/36 .  In the same way, mining a block is like betting on zero on a roulette with many many more numbers (your odds being much much lower) and according to the number of attempts you can do (say per hour) it is probabilistically defined how many blocks you will be likely to close in the same period.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 24 '16 at 10:35             answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:17       Davide C   224 1 4                  Good answer with the analogy.

                            Published September 25, 2017 · Updated October 14, 2017                                                                                                                                                          Years ago, I won a book as reward for completing a little challenge which consisted of solving the following problem:  While driving, I came across a milestone that read a two-digit number ab . One hour later, I saw a new milestone reading the same digits in reverse order ba . Another hour later, I encountered a new milestone with a three-digit number, the same digits as the first milestone separated by a zero: a0b . I was driving faster during the first hour and the difference between the two speed values is a two-digit number. Reversing the two digits on that number gives the value for the first speed e.g. if the speed difference is xy then the first speed value is yx . Can you find a and b ?  When Brute Force is Faster  This problem can be solved through logic (not spoiling in case someone feels inspired). But timing was important so I opened my C++ IDE, wrote the brute-force search below,  set a breakpoint to read the values and submitted the answer:  for (int x = 1; x <= 9; ++x)
	for (int y = 1; y <= 9; ++y)
		for (int a = 0; a <= 9; ++a)
			for (int b = 0; b <= 9; ++b)
				if ((!((b * 10 + a) - ((a * 10 + b) + (x * 10 + y)))) && ((a * 100 + b) - ((x * 10 + y) - (y * 10 + x)) == (b * 10 + a)))
					/* Solution found. */  Basically, it is comparable to what Bitcoin miners do for proof of work .  While academic cryptanalysts are constantly doing research and analysis to break cryptographic algorithms, no practical attack has been found so far on the SHA256 hash function so the fastest known way to find a block header hash below a specific target is by brute force search.  Steady or Lucky?  Miners are essentially playing a lottery game in which increasing their computational power would increase their odds of winning the current 12.5 BTC block reward (e.g. Block #487465 ) — about $50K at current BTC/USD rate of $4181.1.  Since the mining difficulty value is constantly adjusted to match the computational power at play, the blockchain does not suffer from increased hashing rates and miners are essentially inflating the system values — not their production speed.  The difficulty is currently high enough that pools of miners have been forming everywhere. By pooling their resources and sharing the revenue based on their respective computational power equity, even the smaller miners can earn steady revenue.  Solo mining requires much higher odds to be the first to confirm a block due to the current target threshold.  The Odds  What would the odds be for a solo miner to win the jackpot?  Let’s calculate:  According to Block #487465 , today’s Bitcoin difficulty value is 1103400932964.29 so the expected number of hashes to compute in order to find one that is below the target value is:  1103400932964.29 x 2 32 = 4.739070921457514e+21 (or 4.7 sextillion)  The time required to compute these hashes at 1000 Gh/s (assuming an entry level personal ASIC miner could fairly produce that rate):  1103400932964.29 x 2 32 ÷ 10 12 = 4739070921.46s (or 150 years)  We know that the difficulty value is adjusted every 2016 blocks so that it takes an average of 10 minutes to solve the problem so our chance to find a hash would be one in:  1103400932964.29 x 2 32 ÷ (600 x 10 12 ) = 7898451.5  Shall I Buy a Lottery Ticket or…  The chance of winning the Bitcoin Block Reward is currently one in 7,898,451 every 10 minutes with 1000 Gh/s. To preserve the odds you would need to adjust your computational power to the difficulty.  Comparatively:   The chance of winning the Lottery jackpot with 5 matched numbers + bonus is one in 7,509,579 .  The chance of winning the Lottery jackpot with 6 matched numbers is one in 45,057,474  The combined odds of becoming a Lottery millionaire are roughly 10 million to one per line .   Provided that you could try your luck every 10 minutes for a $200 hardware investment that would give you the hash rate used in this simulation, it is cheaper to mine Bitcoin for about the same odds as matching 5 numbers + bonus in the Lottery. However if your hope is to become millionaire (i.e. not just win), it is better to play the Lottery.  Well, that’s if you are feeling lucky because in both cases the odds are well against you…  My 2 satoshi.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Calder Coalson , human capable of multiplying numbers (sometimes correctly) Updated Dec 9, 2013 Snarky Answe r Bitcoins are currently mined in 25 bitcoin blocks (this number halves roughly every 4 years) so the probability of mining exactly one Bitcoin is... 0. Real Answer Miners earn bitcoins by performing crap-tons of hashes , each of which have some small probability of mining a block and producing 25 bitcoins for the miner. The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining so that each block takes an average of 10 minutes to mine. If H hashes are performed every 10 minutes, this means that each hash has a 1/H chance of mining a block. So if you perform N hashes every minute, the number of blocks you find in a minute is binomially distributed with maximum N and probability 1/H  . Using Blockchain.info 's current network hash rate of 6,294,617 Gh/s, the probability of mining a single block is: [math]P(B=1)[/math] [math]= \binom{N}{1}  \binom{N}{N-1} \Big(\dfrac{1}{H}\Big)^1 \Big(\dfrac{H-1}{H}\Big)^{N-1}[/math] [math]= \dfrac{N^2}{H} \Big(\dfrac{H-1}{H}\Big)^{N-1}[/math] [math]\approx 1.58 \times 10^{-8}[/math] Because finding more than one block is vanishingly likely, the probability of finding one  or more blocks will be almost exactly the same, but just for kicks we can calculate it using one minus the probability of finding zero blocks: [math]P(B>0)[/math] [math]= 1 - P(B=0)[/math] [math]= 1 - \left(\dfrac{H-1}{H}\right)^N[/math] [math]\approx 1.58 \times 10^{-8}[/math] More Useful Answer If you're mining to actually make a profit rather than because you're bored with the lottery, what you care about is the expected value , or the number of bitcoins you will earn averaging across all possible universes. This comes out to: [math]\dfrac{1 Gh/s}{10 \cdot 6,294,617 Gh/s} \dfrac{blocks}{minute}[/math] [math]\approx 0.00000016 \dfrac{blocks}{minute}[/math] [math]= 0.0000004 \dfrac{BTC}{minute}[/math] [math]= .000024 \dfrac{BTC}{hour}[/math] [math]= 0.029 \dfrac{USD}{hour}[/math] Most Useful Answer Use a bitcoin mining calculator . ;-) 3k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Is it still worth it to mine Bitcoin in 2017? Ask New Question   Martin Husak , Currently I am excited about Bitcoin. BTC:1Cgo8m7eVQH4V5e8U9jDuSbCypBofyrbLN Answered Dec 4, 2013 I like Calder Coalson 's exact answer. Let's assume question: What is the probability of mining a 25 bitcoins over one minute time period using a 1 Gh/s rig? Current hash rate of BTC network is around 5950 TH/s. You know, that 1 right hash is found cca each 10 minutes. So network do 600*5950TH per 10 minutes. Out of this only one block is the lottery winner. It means that chance to hit the right hash in one attempt is 1:600*5950*10^12. You will perform 60*1.000.000.000 attempts in one mintute. So overall chance is 6 * 10^10 / 3.57 10^18 = 1.6806 * 10^-8 = 0.00000168% This calculation is simplified: Your hash rate is much closer to zero than to 5950TH/s. So linear simplification is used. Do not use such linear simplifications for higher hashrates. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters   Alex H , Blogger (2017-present) Answered Dec 14, 2017 · Author has 131 answers and 20.6k answer views You are more likely to be stuck by lightning during an earthquake while riding on the hood of the Queen’s car in a motorcade.

( self.Bitcoin ) submitted 4 years ago by J-H-M My knowledge of bitcoin mining is not that great. As far as I know you can choose two options, mine solo or join a pool. If you join a pool you are more likely to solve a block but will never receive the 25BTC reward for solving a block, but you will get a cut of it (or fixed amount related to your computing input). However, if you choose to mine solo and manage to solve a block you will get the whole 25BTC.  Of course 25BTC is no lottery win, but I've been wondering for a few days now, what do you have a better chance of winning, the lottery or miners reward?

Create an account [–] Spherius  31 points 32 points 33 points  4 years ago *  (9 children) We'll be generous and assume you have a core i7-3930k, which gets, according to the wiki , 66.6 MH/s, and we'll be even more generous and assume you were able to push it to 100 MH/s. We'll also assume that your CPU only pulls stock wattage, at 130W, to perform this feat.  Now, the difficulty is currently 1,418,481,395. If you multiply this number by 2 32 you will get the number of hashes you need to perform, on average, to find a block, which is 6,092,331,201,509,457,920, or ~6.1 x 10 18.  You perform 1 x 10 8 hashes per second, so it will take you ~6.1 x 10 10 seconds, or 705,130.92 days, or 1,931.86 years to find a block at the current difficulty, on average.  So, your odds are certainly better, at 1 in 705,131 every day, than the lottery would be, but the better question is not, "What are the odds?" but rather, "What is the expected value, and is that more or less than the price of entry?" (Expected value is the value of the prize multiplied by the chance of winning it per entry, expressed as a fraction.)  In this case, the prize is 25 BTC, or about $25,000. If we assume you pay the average US rate at ~$0.12/kwh, you're paying ~$0.3744 per day for the privilege of trying to mine a block (and keep in mind, your computer will not be able to do anything else unless it has multiple CPUs, so that's not really even the only cost). We'll use the power cost as our price per "entry."  As for the expected value:  ( 1 / 715,130.92 ) * $25,000 = ~$0.035  This works out to ~9.47% of the price per "entry."  Now, what about the lottery? Well, a PowerBall ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the PowerBall jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510, so to have a worse expected-value-to-price ratio than mining (given the assumptions above), the PowerBall jackpot has to be less than ~$33.2M. (And just to be clear, the jackpot is typically larger than this, so in most cases PowerBall tickets are a better "investment" than electricity for CPU mining.)  (Note that this does not take taxes into account for either mining or the PowerBall, and keep in mind that they do apply in either case, should you get lucky. Note also that these numbers will shift drastically as you bring the assumptions back into line with reality.)   permalink embed save give gold [–] alanX  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (0 children) Get your self a ASICMiner Erupter (like 25 dollars) and get 335 MH/s.  Then buy a 25 dollar Raspberry Pie to run it.  + a USB fan to cool it (yes, that is necessary).  Now you have dramatically cut your costs, and increased your odds.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] J-H-M [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (1 child) Wow! Thanks for the reply, you're awesome, reddit never ceases to amaze me!  I will pass this message on to my lottery-ticket-buying friends  Is there anyway of knowing whether this has happened in the recent past, i.e. how powerful the computer was that solved a block?

Or wait until the power ball gets high and buy 68 lottery tickets at once. Both have the same amount of dollar investment.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] physalisx  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (1 child) Very nice math, but why did you calculate with a CPU? I think you'd come to a very different result if you'd calculate using a GPU (which is what every sane person would use to mine in this scenario).   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Spherius  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (0 children) The question was about mining with "a standard home laptop/desktop computer," which I took to mean one that doesn't have a fancy GPU, since those are expensive.

Now of course, that doesn't mean it's a good idea, and over time it's completely unrealistic, but technically true for the first calculation, right?  Another question is do all miners start at the same calculation, or are they random until they find the solution? If not, could you program your software to start calculating at X calculations ahead of everyone else to get a head start?  I know a good amount about Bitcoin, but mining is still extremely confusing. :(   permalink embed save give gold [–] bitpar  2 points 3 points 4 points  4 years ago  (0 children) Mining is random. It's like if you flip a coin 10 times and all flips are heads, there is still a 50/50 chance that the next flip will be heads. Bitcoin mining is similar to this, where every hash is just as likely to be a valid hash as the last one. The problem with trying to solo mine for a full block is that difficulty keeps increasing so the chance of finding a block decreases over time and may decrease so far that the chance of you finding a block is next to nothing. If you mined in a pool, you would get a payout proportional to your hashing power so it allows you to share the payouts from blocks before difficulty increases.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Probably wrong, but meh, sounds good enough.  TL;DR 
Most accurate results are toward end of post  Current network hashrate last night at midnight (12:00am, October 31st, 2017) is a whopping 11,600~ PH/s. Think about that. I had to look up what word that translates to. If TH/s is a trillion, then PH/s is a quadrillion. Alright, then 11,600 quadrillions would be 11.6 quintillions.  There are roughly 11.6 quintillion hashes a second of mining power on the Bitcoin Blockchain .  The hashing power of a single Antminer S9 (if you get a good batch) is about 14 TH/s.  Math it out: 14,000,000,000,000 (fourteen trillion) / 11,600,000,000,000,000,000 = ~0.0000012% chance that a single Antminer S9 of successfully solo mining a block on the Bitcoin Blockchain .  Math it out some more, move the zeros over and come up with a ratio, that comes out to being roughly 1:1 million chance .  One in a million? Well shit that doesn't sound so bad, right?  Wrong.  (This is where I know my math is a bit off, but I'm too lazy to do better from here because it's at least close enough. Maybe somebody can correct me if they want to do the math better after here.)  Quite literally one in a million odds, per individual hash, that it will be the one to crack a block. Think about that in terms of days.  1 in 1mil days odds.  1 million days = 2739.72603 years .  So using super ridiculously rough math here, I estimate that with a single Antminer S9, if you started mining from last night at midnight, then at some unknown point in time during the next ~2740 years you would solo mine a block on the Bitcoin Blockchain (and that's IF the network hashrate didn't change at all).  Even with my lazy math, hopefully this estimation will help to minimize the amount of bothersome noobery these days.  Also I encourage somebody to correct my math, because after going through all of this I'm actually curious to know the definitive numbers, if nothing else at least just for shits n gigs.  [EDIT] Thanks to @Raider1284 and @sos755 for coming up with more accurate results.  Odds of winning the Powerball lottery are 1:292,201,338, or a ~0.0000000034% chance.  Odds of hitting a block with a single S9 in a day are 1:5160, or a ~0.00019% chance.

That is: difficulty * 2 32  Then divide by your hashing power to get the total time in secs: difficulty*2 32 / (hashing power)  Which would be: (1,452,839,779,146 x 2 32) ÷ (1.4e+13)= 445707095 secs (14 years 48 days)  To get your chances you have to take into account that a block is found every 10 minutes so it would be 1 in: difficulty * 2 32 / (600 * hashing power)  So (1,452,839,779,146 x 2 32) ÷ (600 x 14,000,000,000,000) = 742,845  So 1 in 742,845 odds, every 10 minutes, of finding a block with a single S9. You can multiply this by 144 to figure out the odds in a day of finding a block!  Which would be 1 in 10,6969,680 chance per day of finding a block.  To put that into perspective the chance of winning the Powerball lottery is 1 in 292,201,338.

I am wondering though, as a solo miner, what are the odds of discovering a new block? I guess this depends on my hardware but if we say that a GPU is 10 times faster than a CPU, and a $10 USB ASIC device is 1000 times faster than a CPU, and a $300 mining box is 5000 times faster than a CPU, perhaps one can adjust the odds estimations to reflect that.  Also, how many BTC would I obtain if I discovered a block?

But they have zillions of hashes per second going on. – Friendly  Nov 5 '13 at 2:16        1      Related question: bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/16687/… – Isac  Sep 10 '15 at 8:47        add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  16  down vote  accepted      Take the total network Th/s and divide by your total Th/s. That number gives you you a number that tells you how many blocks will occur before you get one (on average).  So if there is currently 3,666 Th/s on the network, and you have a 0.55 Th/s (like you would if you have a $5,000 KNCMiner Jupiter ASIC), then 3,666/0.55 = 6,665.  That means you have 1/6,665ths of total hashing capacity.   There will be 6,665 blocks before you get one.  So if there are 144 blocks in a day, then you need to wait 46.28 days to get a block when mining solowith that hardware.  But that is assuming difficulty doesn't rise.   So what will happen with a rising difficulty is you end up waiting much longer even, and possibly never end up getting a block when solo mining.  That's why solo mining is not as profitable as using a pool for anyone without tens of Th/s nowadays.     share | improve this answer      edited Nov 10 '13 at 14:35             answered Nov 5 '13 at 4:04       Stephen Gornick   23.6k 7 48 128              3      Or in the case of a USB miner, which mines maybe 5 GH/s, it would be 4600 days or 12.5 years. And with a CPU miner the chances are 1000 times worse, i.e. infitesimal. So really without good hardware this is like playing the lottery. – Friendly  Nov 5 '13 at 4:22         1      note that the p of {finding a block in X blocks when your chance of mining a block in one unit of time is 1/x} = (1-(6664/6665)^6665) is about .632, so you would actually only need to be mining for about 4605 blocks with .5 probability. Now that the difficulty is about 600 times harder, this is probably a moot point. – hedgedandlevered  Aug 20 '14 at 1:27         add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      To answer your question of:   how many BTC would I obtain if I discovered a block?   25 BTC in a single block currently. This will change over time as less and less BTC are available to mine  Here is an excerpt from bitcoin wiki :   How are new bitcoins created?  New bitcoins are generated by the network through the process of "mining". In a process that is similar to a continuous raffle draw, mining nodes on the network are awarded bitcoins each time they find the solution to a certain mathematical problem (and thereby create a new block). Creating a block is a proof of work with a difficulty that varies with the overall strength of the network. The reward for solving a block is automatically adjusted so that, ideally, every four years of operation of the Bitcoin network, half the amount of bitcoins created in the prior 4 years are created. A maximum of 10,499,889.80231183 bitcoins were created in the first 4 (approx.) years from January 2009 to November 2012. Every four years thereafter this amount halves, so it should be 5,250,000 over years 4-8, 2,625,000 over years 8-12, and so on. Thus, the total number of bitcoins in existence can never exceed 20,999,839.77085749 and counting. See Controlled Currency Supply.  Blocks are mined every 10 minutes, on average and for the first four years (210,000 blocks) each block included 50 new bitcoins. As the amount of processing power directed at mining changes, the difficulty of creating new bitcoins changes. This difficulty factor is calculated every 2016 blocks and is based upon the time taken to generate the previous 2016 blocks.   This is a great place to start reading about bitcoins (coindesk)     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 9 '15 at 14:34       Corey Trombley   21 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      To answer you question about what is the reward for mining a valid block. Currently 25 BTC, previously it was 50 BTC until block number 210,000 was mined. The current amount will be divided by 2 when block number 420,000 is mined.  That said the fluctuation in amounts you see on mined blocks is the transaction fees. When people send bitcoin they have choice to include a mining fee (to get better chance of getting in next block faster than other transactions). Depending on the transactions your miner decide to include you will get more or less bitcoin plus the base reward of 25 BTC. So normally miners that wants to cut a profit will favorite transaction with bigger fee.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 10 '15 at 14:48       Gopoi   744 4 20              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The difficulty changing won't preclude you from finding a block. However because it's essentially random, there's a chance you might never find a block, and also a chance you could find one on the first hash. There's even a chance you could find 10 in a row. It's random, like flipping a fair coin. Each try is also independent, also like flipping a coin. Just because you've flipped the coin 10/ times and it comes up tails, doesn't mean your "due" for it to come up heads. It's still 50/50.     share | improve this answer     answered Jan 17 at 19:58       Michael allen   1              add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  Mar 21 at 16:53   Thank you for your interest in this question.

Would it matter if the farm is in Southern Africa away from anyone, would another miner that is closer always get the block first?   Closer to what? There is no centre.

They apply a hash function to the block and get back a hash. The hash needs to have some properties, e.g. start with 3 zeros. If it doesn't, the miners change a value in the block (called nonce) and apply the hash function again. The new hash will be different. If it still doesn't start with 3 zeros miners repeat the process until they find a hash that starts with 3 zeros. For more details, please read this to understand the mining process.  A hash function is in itself deterministic. However, the mining process is not. Thus, the answer in the link you provided is wrong. If everyone was trying to mine identical blocks with identical nonces of the same exact order then it might be, in a sense, deterministic but that is not the case.  Everyone has a chance to win (although it is so small that in practice doesn't occur). See here for some examples.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:47       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:19       karask   2,023 1 4 13              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The number of attempts to close a block is probabilistically determined by the law of large numbers. In other words, it is theoretically possible for you to generate at your first try an hashing that meets the target even using your paper and pencil but the probability is very low.  As analogy, if you bet on zero playing at roulette you have 1/36 of chance per try. It turns out that you can win at your first try or most likely you don't. If you repeat the try N times (say 1000 times), you will observe that you will win a number K of bets, where K/N is a random variable that has an expected value of 1/36 . That does NOT mean that your K/N is equal to 1/36 , it means that if you repeat the N sequence again and again you will observe K/N average value will be close to 1/36 .  In the same way, mining a block is like betting on zero on a roulette with many many more numbers (your odds being much much lower) and according to the number of attempts you can do (say per hour) it is probabilistically defined how many blocks you will be likely to close in the same period.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 24 '16 at 10:35             answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:17       Davide C   224 1 4                  Good answer with the analogy.

So, even if one cannot find any information suggesting that someone did, it could have happened.  Blockchain.info gives the current hashing power as 47,289,554.08 GHash/s, so your chance to mine any one block would be 3/47,289,554.0 = 6.3439e-8 .  In Germany there is a popular lottery where you have to guess six out of 49 and one out of ten numbers. The chance of getting all seven numbers right is 7.1511e-8 . So, the probability to win the jackpot is currently as likely as solo-mining a block with 3GHash/s. Of course, the lottery has a bunch of smaller prices for getting it partially right, and the jackpot would be worth millions of Euros, not 25 BTC.  But then, it is cheaper to play "Bitcoin lottery" and the draws are more frequent.  Below an estimate of the chance to get one block out of a day's/year's worth of blocks (disregarding increasing difficulty):   Altogether, it seems to me that regular lottery is more profitable, but then "Playing lottery is a tax for people that are bad at math.".     share | improve this answer     answered Apr 1 '14 at 12:09       Murch ♦   31.7k 25 103 277              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Currently network's capacity is about 41000000 Gh/s.

First of let me be clear: I realize that my hardware setup is far from ideal for mining. This is also the reason why I do not want to pool, I would simply provide a too small a share. I will be CPU mining at first, ASIC later on.  I would however like to test my luck. Mostly just for fun, I'm completely fine with the idea of never actually solving a block. I see it more as a lottery. I just want to confirm my idea so that I am not missing something: Do I have a chance of solving a block?  If a block is solved every 10 minutes, and the difficulty goes up continously. Do I even have the time to attempt a solution? I understand that the current work has to be abandoned when a block has been solved, rigth? Is there, for example, a lag here that yields my efforts useless?  What are the odds?

So with the current difficulty 510,929,738 , and a 1Ghash/s mining rig (faster than your CPU) you'd do this math:  510929738 * Math.pow(2,32) / Math.pow(10,9) / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365  So to find a block at this difficulty with a 1Ghash mining rig it would take you about 69 years on average.

Then the question is, what are your chances and should you do it? I think an analogy with a lottery is apt.  In one week, a lottery might cost you $2 (for one ticket) and give you a 1 in 175 million chance to win $100 million (ignoring smaller prizes, splitting prizes, etc.; complicates things too much). This gives it a return on investment (ROI) of about 29% , so we'll treat this as our baseline: if it's lower than this, it's worse than the lottery and you shouldn't "play".  If you buy a $34.52, 5 GH/s ASIC miner that uses 2.5W of power, you might spend about $0.06 in a week to have a 1 in 13,889 chance to win $11,349. Not counting the upfront investment, this is a 1,361% ROI, so it's worth it. If you factor in the cost of the device (split over a year) and a profitability decline (since the rest of the network will be speeding up), I think you're still looking at an ~80% ROI.  In one week of CPU mining (assuming 20 MH/s at 70 W), you might spend $1.75 in power to have a 1 in 3,472,222 chance to win $11,349. This is a 0.18% ROI, so CPU mining really makes no sense, even as a lottery (it'd be better to just buy a lottery ticket).

E.g. you can't do it with human calculations , because by the time you finish one hash (~9.4 hours), more blocks have been found. If you could do one hash in 1 minute, you'd average 10 hashes per block, maybe wasting ~5% of your effort. I'd estimate 10 minutes per hash as the minimum to participate: you could do approx. 1 hash per block. There is a chance that hash is the right one! You've played the lottery. (any computer is measured in kilohashes per second, at least; many times faster than the minimum) – Tim S.  May 22 '14 at 16:43            @Pacerier note that there is no hard minimum. It's possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that no blocks would be found by the network in the ~10 hours you're calculating a hash by hand, and possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that your hash will meet the target difficulty, and possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that you did not make any mistakes in that 10 hours of arithmetic. However, I'm pointing out that when you get into the range of minutes per hash (or slower), there is an extra limiting factor: blocks have likely been found in the meantime. – Tim S.  May 22 '14 at 16:51            @TimS., Good points, didn't thought of that hard minimum. Btw, that extra limiting factor is actually closer to 3 minutes right? Since we had to factor in the delay of actually getting notified when someone else has won lottery. – Pacerier  May 22 '14 at 16:53         |  show 1 more comment            up vote  7  down vote      I do not think the question was about the "how long" it would take in average, but what are the odds, which is something completely different from my point o view.
If I understand well the concept of solving blocks then there are always more people/groups/pools trying to solve one block.
If that's so then solving a block is always more about the luck than the brute force you have. Even if you have a 1GH rig, you can still find the solution quicker then 1PH pool.
Question is: what are the odds that it will happen?
I would expect a ration : to take place in the answer.
So if the current total H-power is about 7.6PH it means that with 1GH rig you have 1:7600000 probability to solve the block approx. every 8 minutes. Which is 1:116 per a year, if the total H-power does not change and it basically does not depend on the difficulty, as the difficulty is based on total H-power.     share | improve this answer     answered Dec 12 '13 at 7:21       noob   71 1              1      You are correct, the question was about the odds of the asker succeeding in finding a block. However, you can either express the odds as chance per block or as expected time until the outcome will be achieved, Luca has chosen the latter. The 1GH is also highly over-estimating his CPU's mining power, a more realistic value would be less than 0.05 GH/s. So, the odds are more along the line of 1:3320 per year, traded for the energy cost of running the PC at full-blast for a year. – Murch ♦  Dec 12 '13 at 11:37        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      It's better than being in the lottery!  The chance you actually find a block will sadly decrease over time (probably). Thing is, if you're lucky you win the lottery. And if you don't get lucky, you don't win and get nothing.  The advantage of being in a pool is that you play in more lotteries, so your luck averages out . If you get lucky 1% of the time and you try once, you probably won 0% of the time. If you try very often it will tend to balance around 1%.  So, all chance calculations aside, are you feeling lucky?  To answer your question more directly: the long block-intervals (10 minutes) are there to reduce network-lag's influence on people's ability to mine on the newest block. There's some influence, inevitably, but others endure it too. Pools can have a minor advantage if they're close together, but the miners connect through them instead of directly. I think there'd be no difference worth mentioning. Short: Yes, it is your % vs network %.  Small footnote should be made about selfish mining, if another pool is big enough they'll have a mining advantage. Smaller it'd be a disadvantage. It's not being done and I hope pools will stay spread thinly enough to make it ineffective. You can safely ignore this. It also doesn't likely matter when you're "lottery mining" (you're still betting just on your own luck!).  Note: you'll have more luck solo-mining LiteCoin or another GPU/CPU coin. Unless you own an ASIC, of course.     share | improve this answer     answered Dec 12 '13 at 12:55       Lodewijk   1,297 8 15                  Better than which lottery? – Pacerier  May 22 '14 at 16:34            Well..

No matter what statistics are used to calculate the odds of hitting the jackpot, they can never be used to predict the outcome.
As we all can read in the numerous variaties and complications (when it comes to calculating probabilities) in the above mentioned posts, it's obvious that there will never be a mathematical model able to predict the possibilities.
There are too many variables that change continously overtime (diffuclty rate, amount of miners, growing blockchain etc.)
Instead of focussing on mining itself you better try and find a way to reduce the cost. If one could use solar energy to power his/her computer then it's no problem at all to have it up and running up to 20 years or even more. In that case it's cheaper then taking part in a lottery and your chances to hit the pot will be no more or less the same either way. 
That's why we call it luck ;)     share | improve this answer     answered Feb 14 '16 at 14:54       klaas   1              1      Downvoted: "No matter what statistics are used to calculate the odds of hitting the jackpot, they can never be used to predict the outcome.

They apply a hash function to the block and get back a hash. The hash needs to have some properties, e.g. start with 3 zeros. If it doesn't, the miners change a value in the block (called nonce) and apply the hash function again. The new hash will be different. If it still doesn't start with 3 zeros miners repeat the process until they find a hash that starts with 3 zeros. For more details, please read this to understand the mining process.  A hash function is in itself deterministic. However, the mining process is not. Thus, the answer in the link you provided is wrong. If everyone was trying to mine identical blocks with identical nonces of the same exact order then it might be, in a sense, deterministic but that is not the case.  Everyone has a chance to win (although it is so small that in practice doesn't occur). See here for some examples.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:47       Community ♦   1        answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:19       karask   2,023 1 4 13              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The number of attempts to close a block is probabilistically determined by the law of large numbers. In other words, it is theoretically possible for you to generate at your first try an hashing that meets the target even using your paper and pencil but the probability is very low.  As analogy, if you bet on zero playing at roulette you have 1/36 of chance per try. It turns out that you can win at your first try or most likely you don't. If you repeat the try N times (say 1000 times), you will observe that you will win a number K of bets, where K/N is a random variable that has an expected value of 1/36 . That does NOT mean that your K/N is equal to 1/36 , it means that if you repeat the N sequence again and again you will observe K/N average value will be close to 1/36 .  In the same way, mining a block is like betting on zero on a roulette with many many more numbers (your odds being much much lower) and according to the number of attempts you can do (say per hour) it is probabilistically defined how many blocks you will be likely to close in the same period.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 24 '16 at 10:35             answered Feb 23 '16 at 11:17       Davide C   224 1 4                  Good answer with the analogy.

                            Published September 25, 2017 · Updated October 14, 2017                                                                                                                                                          Years ago, I won a book as reward for completing a little challenge which consisted of solving the following problem:  While driving, I came across a milestone that read a two-digit number ab . One hour later, I saw a new milestone reading the same digits in reverse order ba . Another hour later, I encountered a new milestone with a three-digit number, the same digits as the first milestone separated by a zero: a0b . I was driving faster during the first hour and the difference between the two speed values is a two-digit number. Reversing the two digits on that number gives the value for the first speed e.g. if the speed difference is xy then the first speed value is yx . Can you find a and b ?  When Brute Force is Faster  This problem can be solved through logic (not spoiling in case someone feels inspired). But timing was important so I opened my C++ IDE, wrote the brute-force search below,  set a breakpoint to read the values and submitted the answer:  for (int x = 1; x <= 9; ++x)
	for (int y = 1; y <= 9; ++y)
		for (int a = 0; a <= 9; ++a)
			for (int b = 0; b <= 9; ++b)
				if ((!((b * 10 + a) - ((a * 10 + b) + (x * 10 + y)))) && ((a * 100 + b) - ((x * 10 + y) - (y * 10 + x)) == (b * 10 + a)))
					/* Solution found. */  Basically, it is comparable to what Bitcoin miners do for proof of work .  While academic cryptanalysts are constantly doing research and analysis to break cryptographic algorithms, no practical attack has been found so far on the SHA256 hash function so the fastest known way to find a block header hash below a specific target is by brute force search.  Steady or Lucky?  Miners are essentially playing a lottery game in which increasing their computational power would increase their odds of winning the current 12.5 BTC block reward (e.g. Block #487465 ) — about $50K at current BTC/USD rate of $4181.1.  Since the mining difficulty value is constantly adjusted to match the computational power at play, the blockchain does not suffer from increased hashing rates and miners are essentially inflating the system values — not their production speed.  The difficulty is currently high enough that pools of miners have been forming everywhere. By pooling their resources and sharing the revenue based on their respective computational power equity, even the smaller miners can earn steady revenue.  Solo mining requires much higher odds to be the first to confirm a block due to the current target threshold.  The Odds  What would the odds be for a solo miner to win the jackpot?  Let’s calculate:  According to Block #487465 , today’s Bitcoin difficulty value is 1103400932964.29 so the expected number of hashes to compute in order to find one that is below the target value is:  1103400932964.29 x 2 32 = 4.739070921457514e+21 (or 4.7 sextillion)  The time required to compute these hashes at 1000 Gh/s (assuming an entry level personal ASIC miner could fairly produce that rate):  1103400932964.29 x 2 32 ÷ 10 12 = 4739070921.46s (or 150 years)  We know that the difficulty value is adjusted every 2016 blocks so that it takes an average of 10 minutes to solve the problem so our chance to find a hash would be one in:  1103400932964.29 x 2 32 ÷ (600 x 10 12 ) = 7898451.5  Shall I Buy a Lottery Ticket or…  The chance of winning the Bitcoin Block Reward is currently one in 7,898,451 every 10 minutes with 1000 Gh/s. To preserve the odds you would need to adjust your computational power to the difficulty.  Comparatively:   The chance of winning the Lottery jackpot with 5 matched numbers + bonus is one in 7,509,579 .  The chance of winning the Lottery jackpot with 6 matched numbers is one in 45,057,474  The combined odds of becoming a Lottery millionaire are roughly 10 million to one per line .   Provided that you could try your luck every 10 minutes for a $200 hardware investment that would give you the hash rate used in this simulation, it is cheaper to mine Bitcoin for about the same odds as matching 5 numbers + bonus in the Lottery. However if your hope is to become millionaire (i.e. not just win), it is better to play the Lottery.  Well, that’s if you are feeling lucky because in both cases the odds are well against you…  My 2 satoshi.

Undo Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Calder Coalson , human capable of multiplying numbers (sometimes correctly) Updated Dec 9, 2013 Snarky Answe r Bitcoins are currently mined in 25 bitcoin blocks (this number halves roughly every 4 years) so the probability of mining exactly one Bitcoin is... 0. Real Answer Miners earn bitcoins by performing crap-tons of hashes , each of which have some small probability of mining a block and producing 25 bitcoins for the miner. The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining so that each block takes an average of 10 minutes to mine. If H hashes are performed every 10 minutes, this means that each hash has a 1/H chance of mining a block. So if you perform N hashes every minute, the number of blocks you find in a minute is binomially distributed with maximum N and probability 1/H  . Using Blockchain.info 's current network hash rate of 6,294,617 Gh/s, the probability of mining a single block is: [math]P(B=1)[/math] [math]= \binom{N}{1}  \binom{N}{N-1} \Big(\dfrac{1}{H}\Big)^1 \Big(\dfrac{H-1}{H}\Big)^{N-1}[/math] [math]= \dfrac{N^2}{H} \Big(\dfrac{H-1}{H}\Big)^{N-1}[/math] [math]\approx 1.58 \times 10^{-8}[/math] Because finding more than one block is vanishingly likely, the probability of finding one  or more blocks will be almost exactly the same, but just for kicks we can calculate it using one minus the probability of finding zero blocks: [math]P(B>0)[/math] [math]= 1 - P(B=0)[/math] [math]= 1 - \left(\dfrac{H-1}{H}\right)^N[/math] [math]\approx 1.58 \times 10^{-8}[/math] More Useful Answer If you're mining to actually make a profit rather than because you're bored with the lottery, what you care about is the expected value , or the number of bitcoins you will earn averaging across all possible universes. This comes out to: [math]\dfrac{1 Gh/s}{10 \cdot 6,294,617 Gh/s} \dfrac{blocks}{minute}[/math] [math]\approx 0.00000016 \dfrac{blocks}{minute}[/math] [math]= 0.0000004 \dfrac{BTC}{minute}[/math] [math]= .000024 \dfrac{BTC}{hour}[/math] [math]= 0.029 \dfrac{USD}{hour}[/math] Most Useful Answer Use a bitcoin mining calculator . ;-) 3k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

BTC:1Cgo8m7eVQH4V5e8U9jDuSbCypBofyrbLN Answered Dec 4, 2013 I like Calder Coalson 's exact answer. Let's assume question: What is the probability of mining a 25 bitcoins over one minute time period using a 1 Gh/s rig? Current hash rate of BTC network is around 5950 TH/s. You know, that 1 right hash is found cca each 10 minutes. So network do 600*5950TH per 10 minutes. Out of this only one block is the lottery winner. It means that chance to hit the right hash in one attempt is 1:600*5950*10^12. You will perform 60*1.000.000.000 attempts in one mintute. So overall chance is 6 * 10^10 / 3.57 10^18 = 1.6806 * 10^-8 = 0.00000168% This calculation is simplified: Your hash rate is much closer to zero than to 5950TH/s. So linear simplification is used. Do not use such linear simplifications for higher hashrates. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters   Alex H , Blogger (2017-present) Answered Dec 14, 2017 · Author has 131 answers and 20.6k answer views You are more likely to be stuck by lightning during an earthquake while riding on the hood of the Queen’s car in a motorcade.

( self.Bitcoin ) submitted 4 years ago by J-H-M My knowledge of bitcoin mining is not that great. As far as I know you can choose two options, mine solo or join a pool. If you join a pool you are more likely to solve a block but will never receive the 25BTC reward for solving a block, but you will get a cut of it (or fixed amount related to your computing input). However, if you choose to mine solo and manage to solve a block you will get the whole 25BTC.  Of course 25BTC is no lottery win, but I've been wondering for a few days now, what do you have a better chance of winning, the lottery or miners reward?

Create an account [–] Spherius  31 points 32 points 33 points  4 years ago *  (9 children) We'll be generous and assume you have a core i7-3930k, which gets, according to the wiki , 66.6 MH/s, and we'll be even more generous and assume you were able to push it to 100 MH/s. We'll also assume that your CPU only pulls stock wattage, at 130W, to perform this feat.  Now, the difficulty is currently 1,418,481,395. If you multiply this number by 2 32 you will get the number of hashes you need to perform, on average, to find a block, which is 6,092,331,201,509,457,920, or ~6.1 x 10 18.  You perform 1 x 10 8 hashes per second, so it will take you ~6.1 x 10 10 seconds, or 705,130.92 days, or 1,931.86 years to find a block at the current difficulty, on average.  So, your odds are certainly better, at 1 in 705,131 every day, than the lottery would be, but the better question is not, "What are the odds?" but rather, "What is the expected value, and is that more or less than the price of entry?" (Expected value is the value of the prize multiplied by the chance of winning it per entry, expressed as a fraction.)  In this case, the prize is 25 BTC, or about $25,000. If we assume you pay the average US rate at ~$0.12/kwh, you're paying ~$0.3744 per day for the privilege of trying to mine a block (and keep in mind, your computer will not be able to do anything else unless it has multiple CPUs, so that's not really even the only cost). We'll use the power cost as our price per "entry."  As for the expected value:  ( 1 / 715,130.92 ) * $25,000 = ~$0.035  This works out to ~9.47% of the price per "entry."  Now, what about the lottery? Well, a PowerBall ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the PowerBall jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510, so to have a worse expected-value-to-price ratio than mining (given the assumptions above), the PowerBall jackpot has to be less than ~$33.2M. (And just to be clear, the jackpot is typically larger than this, so in most cases PowerBall tickets are a better "investment" than electricity for CPU mining.)  (Note that this does not take taxes into account for either mining or the PowerBall, and keep in mind that they do apply in either case, should you get lucky. Note also that these numbers will shift drastically as you bring the assumptions back into line with reality.)   permalink embed save give gold [–] alanX  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (0 children) Get your self a ASICMiner Erupter (like 25 dollars) and get 335 MH/s.  Then buy a 25 dollar Raspberry Pie to run it.  + a USB fan to cool it (yes, that is necessary).

Now of course, that doesn't mean it's a good idea, and over time it's completely unrealistic, but technically true for the first calculation, right?  Another question is do all miners start at the same calculation, or are they random until they find the solution? If not, could you program your software to start calculating at X calculations ahead of everyone else to get a head start?  I know a good amount about Bitcoin, but mining is still extremely confusing. :(   permalink embed save give gold [–] bitpar  2 points 3 points 4 points  4 years ago  (0 children) Mining is random. It's like if you flip a coin 10 times and all flips are heads, there is still a 50/50 chance that the next flip will be heads. Bitcoin mining is similar to this, where every hash is just as likely to be a valid hash as the last one. The problem with trying to solo mine for a full block is that difficulty keeps increasing so the chance of finding a block decreases over time and may decrease so far that the chance of you finding a block is next to nothing. If you mined in a pool, you would get a payout proportional to your hashing power so it allows you to share the payouts from blocks before difficulty increases.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Probably wrong, but meh, sounds good enough.  TL;DR 
Most accurate results are toward end of post  Current network hashrate last night at midnight (12:00am, October 31st, 2017) is a whopping 11,600~ PH/s. Think about that. I had to look up what word that translates to. If TH/s is a trillion, then PH/s is a quadrillion. Alright, then 11,600 quadrillions would be 11.6 quintillions.  There are roughly 11.6 quintillion hashes a second of mining power on the Bitcoin Blockchain .  The hashing power of a single Antminer S9 (if you get a good batch) is about 14 TH/s.  Math it out: 14,000,000,000,000 (fourteen trillion) / 11,600,000,000,000,000,000 = ~0.0000012% chance that a single Antminer S9 of successfully solo mining a block on the Bitcoin Blockchain .  Math it out some more, move the zeros over and come up with a ratio, that comes out to being roughly 1:1 million chance .  One in a million? Well shit that doesn't sound so bad, right?  Wrong.  (This is where I know my math is a bit off, but I'm too lazy to do better from here because it's at least close enough. Maybe somebody can correct me if they want to do the math better after here.)  Quite literally one in a million odds, per individual hash, that it will be the one to crack a block. Think about that in terms of days.  1 in 1mil days odds.  1 million days = 2739.72603 years .  So using super ridiculously rough math here, I estimate that with a single Antminer S9, if you started mining from last night at midnight, then at some unknown point in time during the next ~2740 years you would solo mine a block on the Bitcoin Blockchain (and that's IF the network hashrate didn't change at all).  Even with my lazy math, hopefully this estimation will help to minimize the amount of bothersome noobery these days.  Also I encourage somebody to correct my math, because after going through all of this I'm actually curious to know the definitive numbers, if nothing else at least just for shits n gigs.  [EDIT] Thanks to @Raider1284 and @sos755 for coming up with more accurate results.  Odds of winning the Powerball lottery are 1:292,201,338, or a ~0.0000000034% chance.  Odds of hitting a block with a single S9 in a day are 1:5160, or a ~0.00019% chance.

I wish I had enough time to keep adding features to it.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Raider1284  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 months ago *  (2 children) You have to first convert the difficulty into the number of hashes needed to find a block.  That is: difficulty * 2 32  Then divide by your hashing power to get the total time in secs: difficulty*2 32 / (hashing power)  Which would be: (1,452,839,779,146 x 2 32) ÷ (1.4e+13)= 445707095 secs (14 years 48 days)  To get your chances you have to take into account that a block is found every 10 minutes so it would be 1 in: difficulty * 2 32 / (600 * hashing power)  So (1,452,839,779,146 x 2 32) ÷ (600 x 14,000,000,000,000) = 742,845  So 1 in 742,845 odds, every 10 minutes, of finding a block with a single S9. You can multiply this by 144 to figure out the odds in a day of finding a block!  Which would be 1 in 10,6969,680 chance per day of finding a block.  To put that into perspective the chance of winning the Powerball lottery is 1 in 292,201,338.

Thank you for finishing this for me and doing it actually the right way. That's pretty insane odds.

The current difficulty is 1,452,839,779,146.  The odds of mining the next block with a single s9 are 1 in 1.453x10 12 * 2 32 / 600 / 14x10 12 = 1 in 743000.  The probability of mining at least one block in a day are 1 - (1 - 1/743000) 144 = 1 in 5160.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] darkbarf  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 months ago  (2 children) here you go http://solochance.com/   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] therealjayvi90 [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (1 child) You sir, deserve a 🏆.

From what I understood, yes mining at home is profitable if you live in a area where electricity is cheap. But you will be better to join a pool of miner, from what I get if you are not joining a pool, you will simply not have enough computing power to complete a block before other.

Otherwise you have no reward. It's like playing a lottery that only has the first prize. That's why it's all or nothing.  To give you an idea of the numbers, with 14 TH/s the  "normal" time to find a block is 12 years or more. Obviously, you can get lucky like in the lottery but don't count on it. If you join a pool you can receive something like 0.002 BTC per day.  You can try one of the several calculators like https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Dotabjj  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (1 child) solo mining means not mining from a pool right?  so you get all the reward, all 12.5 btc... if you could find a block.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] doc_samson  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 months ago  (0 children)  if you could find a block   That's the hard part. The race is specifically designed so that the odds are low that any one specific machine can reliably find a block, but on average one machine globally finds one every ten minutes.  So it's like buying a lottery ticket that costs $1-3k for the machine and $thousands for the electricity, hoping for the $50k jackpot.  And since the puzzle gets tougher every two weeks, that top-end machine from last year is lagging behind this year, so upgrade or fall behind.  Mining Bitcoin is a capital investment lottery.  Now altcoins might be much better.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] doc_samson  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) There may be better calculators out there but this will give you an idea.  https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator  Yes Bitcoin solo mining is all-or-nothing -- you solve the puzzle within ten minutes and get all 12.5BTC, or you don't and get nothing. Odds of mining a block are about once every year or two by design. Joining a pool gets you a % payout based on your participation level.
