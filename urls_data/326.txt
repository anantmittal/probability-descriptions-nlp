Endometrial Cancer  About Endometrial Cancer             Key Statistics for Endometrial Cancer       How common is endometrial cancer?  In the United States, cancer of the endometrium is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs. The American Cancer Society estimates for cancer of the uterus in the United States for 2018 are:   About 63,230 new cases of cancer of the body of the uterus (uterine body or corpus) will be diagnosed.  About 11,350 women will die from cancers of the uterine body.   These estimates include both endometrial cancers and uterine sarcomas. Up to 8% of uterine body cancers are sarcomas, so the actual numbers for endometrial cancer cases and deaths are slightly lower than these estimates.  Lifetime chance of getting endometrial cancer  Endometrial cancer affects mainly postmenopausal women. The average age of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer is 60. It is uncommon in women under the age of 45.  This cancer is slightly more common in white women, but black women are more likely to die from it. There are more than 600,000 survivors of endometrial cancer.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

Credit: National Cancer Institute     Pap smear tests, which screen for cervical cancer, may help identify ovarian and uterine cancer as well, a new study suggests.  That's because the cervical fluid collected during a Pap smear can contain cells, including cancer cells, that have been shed from theovaries or endometrium (the lining of the uterus). During the study, researchers developed a test to look for genetic markers of ovarian and endometrial cancers that were present in the cervical fluid. (The new test requires cervical fluid from a Pap smear, but analyzes it in a different way than does the test for cervical cancer.)  Among women already known to have these cancers, the test correctly identified 100 percent of endometrial cancers, and 41 percent of ovarian cancers. Fourteen healthy women also had the test, and none were identify as having cancer.  Currently, there are no recommended screening tests for ovarian or endometrial cancer. Proposed screening tests for these cancers, such as a blood test for ovarian cancer , often turn up false positive results, meaning they identify "red flags" that turn out not to be cancer.  The new test, or one like it, might one day be used to screen for ovarian and endometrial cancer, but the researchers stress much more work needs to be done before this could happen. Researchers need to study the test in a much larger group of women, and investigate whether or not it can find cancer in its earliest stages.  In the United States, about 15,000 women die from ovarian cancer and 8,000 die from endometrial cancer each year. Symptoms of ovarian cancer are vague, and women with the disease are often not diagnosed until the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. [See 5 Things Women Should Know About Ovarian Cancer .]   Endometrial cancer is typically diagnosed early when symptoms such as vaginal bleeding occur.  During a Pap smear, doctors use a brush to collect samples of cells from the cervix, which are then studied under a microscope for signs of cancer. Recently, researchers have started testing cervical samples for DNA from human papillomavirus, or HPV, a virus that can cause cervical cancer.  Using a method similar to HPV testing , the new test looks for DNA from ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. To create the test, the researchers identified genes that are frequently mutated in ovarian and endometrial cancer. The test, known as PapGene, screens for these abnormal genes.  The researchers tested PapGene on Pap smear samples from 22 women with ovarian cancer and 24 women with endometrial cancer. The test identified all 24 endometrial cancers, and nine out of 22 ovarian cancers.  The cost of PapGene could be similar to that for HPV testing, which is about $100, the researchers said.  A few changes might improve the ability of PapGene to detect ovarian cancer, such as inserting the cervical brush deeper into the cervical canal during a Pap smear, or finding more genetic markers of the disease, said study researcher Dr. Chetan Bettegowda, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University.  But it could be that the biology of ovarian cancer may not always lend itself to this type of testing. "Perhaps only a proportion of ovarian cancers would have cells or DNA that are shed in sufficient quantities for detection [in the cervix]," Dr. Shannon Westin, a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and colleagues, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.  The study and editorial are published today (Jan. 9) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the uterus. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ in women where fetal development occurs.  Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining (endometrium) of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer is often detected at an early stage because it frequently produces abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts women to see their doctors. If endometrial cancer is discovered early, removing the uterus surgically often cures endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer care at Mayo Clinic      Symptoms Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer may include:   Vaginal bleeding after menopause  Bleeding between periods  An abnormal, watery or blood-tinged discharge from your vagina  Pelvic pain   When to see a doctor  Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you, such as vaginal bleeding or discharge not related to your periods, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Doctors don't know what causes endometrial cancer. What's known is that something occurs to create a genetic mutation within cells in the endometrium — the lining of the uterus.  The genetic mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die at a set time. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).  Risk factors    Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.     Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include:    Changes in the balance of female hormones in the body. Your ovaries make two main female hormones — estrogen and progesterone. Fluctuations in the balance of these hormones cause changes in your endometrium.  A disease or condition that increases the amount of estrogen, but not the level of progesterone, in your body can increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Examples include irregular ovulation patterns, such as those that can occur in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Taking hormones after menopause that contain estrogen but not progesterone increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  A rare type of ovarian tumor that secretes estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.   More years of menstruation. Starting menstruation at an early age — before age 12 — or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.  Never having been pregnant. Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than do women who have had at least one pregnancy.  Older age. As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often in women who have undergone menopause.  Obesity. Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may occur because excess body fat alters your body's balance of hormones.  Hormone therapy for breast cancer. Women with breast cancer who take the hormone therapy drug  tamoxifen have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, discuss this risk with your doctor. For most women, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.  An inherited colon cancer syndrome. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a syndrome that increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. HNPCC occurs because of a gene mutation passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with HNPCC, discuss your risk of the genetic syndrome with your doctor. If you've been diagnosed with HNPCC, ask your doctor what cancer screening tests you should undergo.   Prevention To reduce your risk of endometrial cancer, you may wish to:   Talk to your doctor about the risks of hormone therapy after menopause. If you're considering hormone replacement therapy to help control menopause symptoms, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Unless you've undergone a hysterectomy, replacing estrogen alone after menopause may increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk. Hormone therapy carries other risks, such as a possible increase in the risk of breast cancer, so weigh the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Consider taking birth control pills. Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk. The risk reduction is thought to last for several years after you stop taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives have side effects, though, so discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, increase your physical activity and reduce the number of calories you eat each day.  Exercise most days of the week. Exercise may reduce your risk of endometrial cancer. Add physical activity into your daily routine. Try to exercise 30 minutes most days of the week. If you can exercise more, that's even better.

Use the menu to see other pages.  A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices.  The following factors may raise a woman’s risk of developing uterine cancer:   Age. Uterine cancer most often occurs in women over 50; the average age is 60.    Obesity. Fatty tissue in women who are overweight produces additional estrogen, a sex hormone that can increase the risk of uterine cancer. This risk increases with an increase in body mass index (BMI), which is the ratio of a person's weight to height. About 40% of uterine cancer cases are linked to obesity.    Race. White women are more likely to develop uterine cancer than women of other races/ethnicities. However, black women have a higher chance of developing advanced cancer. Black and Hispanic women also have a higher risk of developing aggressive tumors.    Genetics. Uterine cancer may run in families where colon cancer is hereditary. For instance, women in families with Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), have a higher risk for uterine cancer. It is recommended that all women under the age of 60 with endometrial cancer should have their tumor tested for Lynch syndrome even if they have no family history of bowel cancer or other cancers. The presence of Lynch syndrome has important implications for women and their family members. About 2% to 5% of women with endometrial cancer have Lynch syndrome. In the United States, about 1,000 to 2,500 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer each year may have this genetic condition. Read about Lynch syndrome .    Diabetes. Women may have an increased risk of uterine cancer if they have diabetes, which is often associated with obesity (see above).    Other cancers. Women who have had breast cancer, colon cancer, or ovarian cancer have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Tamoxifen. Women taking the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex) to prevent or treat breast cancer have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. The benefits of tamoxifen usually outweigh the risk of developing uterine cancer, but all women who are prescribed tamoxifen should discuss the benefits and risks with their doctor.    Radiation therapy. Women who have had previous radiation therapy for another cancer in the pelvic area, which is the lower part of the abdomen between the hip bones, have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Diet. Women who eat foods high in animal fat may have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Estrogen. Extended exposure to estrogen and/or an imbalance of estrogen is related to many of the following risk factors:   Women who started having their periods before age 12 and/or go through menopause later in life. Learn more about menopause and cancer risk .    Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, especially if they are taking estrogen alone. The risk is lower for women who take estrogen with progesterone, which is another sex hormone.    Women who have never been pregnant.    Prevention  Different factors contribute to different types of cancer. Researchers continue to investigate what factors increase risk for this type of cancer. Although there is no proven way to completely prevent this disease, you may be able to lower your risk. Talk with your doctor for more information about your personal risk of cancer.  Research has shown that certain factors can lower the risk of uterine cancer:   Taking birth control pills. Birth control pills have a combination of estrogen and progesterone that are taken cyclically to produce a monthly menstrual period, which reduces the risk of an overgrowth of the uterine lining, especially when taken over a long period of time.    Using a progestin-secreting intrauterine device (IUD), which is a form of birth control.    Considering the risk of uterine cancer before starting HRT, especially estrogen replacement therapy alone. Using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for HRT may help lower risk.    Maintaining a healthy weight.

Endometrial Cancer  Causes, Risks Factors, and Prevention             Endometrial Cancer Risk Factors   A risk factor is anything that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.  Although certain factors increase a woman's risk for developing endometrial cancer, they do not always cause the disease. Many women with one or more risk factors never develop endometrial cancer.  Some women with endometrial cancer do not have any known risk factors. Even if a woman with endometrial cancer has one or more risk factors, there is no way to know which, if any, of these factors was responsible for her cancer.  Several factors influence the risk of developing endometrial cancer, including:   Things that affect hormone levels, like taking estrogen after menopause, birth control pills, or tamoxifen; the number of menstrual cycles (over a lifetime), pregnancy, obesity, certain ovarian tumors, and polycystic ovarian syndrome  Use of an intrauterine device  Age  Diet and exercise  Diabetes  Family history (having close relatives with endometrial or colorectal cancer)  Having been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer in the past  Having been diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia in the past  Treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis to treat another cancer   Some of these, like pregnancy, birth control pills, and the use of an intrauterine device are linked to a lower risk of endometrial cancer, while many are linked to a higher risk. These factors and how they affect endometrial cancer risk are discussed in more detail below.  Hormone factors  A woman's hormone balance plays a part in the development of most endometrial cancers. Many of the risk factors for endometrial cancer affect estrogen levels. Before menopause, the ovaries are the major source of the 2 main types of female hormones -- estrogen and progesterone.  The balance between these hormones changes during a woman's menstrual cycle each month. This produces a woman's monthly periods and keeps the endometrium healthy. A shift in the balance of these hormones toward more estrogen increases a woman's risk for developing endometrial cancer.  After menopause, the ovaries stop making these hormones, but a small amount of estrogen is still made naturally in fat tissue. Estrogen from fat tissue has a bigger impact after menopause than it does before menopause.  Estrogen therapy  Treating the symptoms of menopause with hormones is known as menopausal hormone therapy (or sometimes hormone replacement therapy). Estrogen is the major part of this treatment. Estrogen treatment can reduce hot flashes, improve vaginal dryness, and help prevent the weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) that can occur with menopause.  Doctors have found, however, that using estrogen alone (without progesterone) can lead to type I endometrial cancer in women who still have a uterus. To lower that risk , a progestin (progesterone or a drug like it) must be given along with estrogen. This approach is called combination hormone therapy.  Women who take progesterone along with estrogen to treat menopausal symptoms do not have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Still, taking this combination increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and also increases the risk of serious blood clots.  If you are taking (or plan to take) hormones after menopause, it is important to discuss the possible risks (including cancer, blood clots, heart attacks, and stroke) with your doctor.  Like any other medicine, hormones should be used only at the lowest dose that is needed and for the shortest possible time to control symptoms. As with any other medicine you take for a long time, you’ll need to see your doctor regularly. Experts recommend yearly follow-up pelvic exams. If you have any abnormal bleeding or discharge from the vagina you should see your doctor or other health care provider right away (and not wait for a check-up).  For more information about the cancer risks from taking hormones after menopause, see Menopausal Hormone Therapy and Cancer Risk .  Birth control pills  Using birth control pills (oral contraceptives) lowers the risk of endometrial cancer. The risk is lowest in women who take the pill for a long time, and this protection continues for at least 10 years after a woman stops taking this form of birth control. However, it is important to look at all of the risks and benefits when choosing a contraceptive method; endometrial cancer risk is only one factor to be considered. It's a good idea to discuss the pros and cons of different types of birth control with your doctor.  Total number of menstrual cycles  Having more menstrual cycles during a woman's lifetime raises her risk of endometrial cancer. Starting menstrual periods (menarche) before age 12 and/or going through menopause later in life raises the risk. Starting periods early is less a risk factor for women with early menopause. Likewise, late menopause may not lead to a higher risk in women whose periods began later in their teens.  Pregnancy  The hormonal balance shifts toward more progesterone during pregnancy. So having many pregnancies protects against endometrial cancer. Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk, especially if they were also infertile (unable to become pregnant).  Obesity  A woman's ovaries produce most of her estrogen, but fat tissue can change some other hormones (called androgens ) into estrogens. Having more fat tissue can increase a woman's estrogen levels, which increases her endometrial cancer risk. In comparison with women who maintain a healthy weight, endometrial cancer is twice as common in overweight women, and more than three times as common in obese women.  Tamoxifen  Tamoxifen is a drug that is used to prevent and treat  breast cancer . Tamoxifen acts as an anti-estrogen in breast tissue, but it acts like an estrogen in the uterus. In women who have gone through menopause, it can cause the uterine lining to grow, which increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  The risk of developing endometrial cancer from tamoxifen is low (less than 1% per year). Women taking tamoxifen must balance this risk against the benefits of this drug in treating and preventing breast cancer. This is an issue women should discuss with their doctors. If you are taking tamoxifen, you should have yearly gynecologic exams and should be sure to report any abnormal bleeding, as this could be a sign of endometrial cancer.  Ovarian tumors  A certain type of ovarian tumor, the granulosa cell tumor , often makes estrogen. Estrogen release by one of these tumors is not controlled the way hormone release from the ovaries is, and can sometimes lead to high estrogen levels. The resulting hormone imbalance can stimulate the endometrium and even lead to endometrial cancer. In fact, sometimes vaginal bleeding from endometrial cancer is the first symptom of one of these tumors.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome  Women with a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have abnormal hormone levels, such as higher androgen (male hormones) and estrogen levels and lower levels of progesterone. The increase in estrogen relative to progesterone can increase a woman's chance of getting endometrial cancer. PCOS is also a leading cause of infertility in women.  Using an intrauterine device  Women who used an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control seem to have a lower risk of getting endometrial cancer. Information about this protective effect is limited to IUDs that do not contain hormones. Researchers have not yet studied whether newer types of IUDs that release progesterone have any effect on endometrial cancer risk. However, these IUDs are sometimes used to treat pre-cancers and early endometrial cancers in women who wish to preserve child-bearing ability.  Age  The risk of endometrial cancer increases as a woman gets older.  Diet and exercise  A high-fat diet can increase the risk of several cancers, including endometrial cancer. Because fatty foods are also high-calorie foods, a high-fat diet can lead to obesity, which is a well-known endometrial cancer risk factor. Many scientists think this is the main way in which a high-fat diet raises endometrial cancer risk. Some scientists think that fatty foods may also have a direct effect on estrogen metabolism, which increases endometrial cancer risk.  Physical activity lowers the risk of endometrial cancer. Several studies found that women who exercised more had a lower risk of endometrial cancer, while in one study women who spent more time sitting had a higher risk. To learn more, you can read the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention .  Diabetes  Endometrial cancer may be as much as 4 times more common in women with diabetes. Diabetes is more common in people who are overweight, but even people with diabetes who are not overweight have a higher risk of endometrial cancer.  Family history  Endometrial cancer tends to run in some families. Some of these families also have an inherited tendency to develop colon cancer . This disorder is called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Another name for HNPCC is Lynch syndrome. In most cases, this disorder is caused by a defect in either the mismatch repair gene MLH1 or the gene MSH2 . But at least 5 other genes can cause HNPCC: MLH3 , MSH6 , TGBR2 , PMS1 , and PMS2. An abnormal copy of any one of these genes reduces the body's ability to repair damage to its DNA or regulate cell growth. This results in a very high risk of colon cancer, as well as a high risk of endometrial cancer. Women with this syndrome have a 40% to 60% risk of developing endometrial cancer at some point. The risk of ovarian cancer is also increased. General information about inherited cancer syndromes can be found in Family Cancer Syndromes .  Some families have a high rate of only endometrial cancer. These families may have a different genetic disorder that hasn't been discovered yet.  Breast or ovarian cancer  Women who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer may have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer, too. Some of the dietary, hormonal, and reproductive risk factors for breast and ovarian cancer also increase endometrial cancer risk.  Endometrial hyperplasia  Endometrial hyperplasia is an increased growth of the endometrium. Mild or simple hyperplasia, the most common type, has a very small risk of becoming cancerous. It may go away on its own or after treatment with hormone therapy. If the hyperplasia is called “atypical,” it has a higher chance of becoming a cancer. Simple atypical hyperplasia turns into cancer in about 8% of cases if it’s not treated. If it’s not treated, complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) has a risk of becoming cancerous in up to 29% of cases, and the risk of having an undetected endometrial cancer is even higher. For this reason, CAH is usually treated. (Treatment is discussed in the section Can endometrial cancer be prevented? )  Prior pelvic radiation therapy  Radiation used to treat some other cancers can damage the DNA of cells, sometimes increasing the risk of a second type of cancer such as endometrial cancer.

Use the menu to see other pages.  A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices.  The following factors may raise a woman’s risk of developing uterine cancer:   Age. Uterine cancer most often occurs in women over 50; the average age is 60.    Obesity. Fatty tissue in women who are overweight produces additional estrogen, a sex hormone that can increase the risk of uterine cancer. This risk increases with an increase in body mass index (BMI), which is the ratio of a person's weight to height. About 40% of uterine cancer cases are linked to obesity.    Race. White women are more likely to develop uterine cancer than women of other races/ethnicities. However, black women have a higher chance of developing advanced cancer. Black and Hispanic women also have a higher risk of developing aggressive tumors.    Genetics. Uterine cancer may run in families where colon cancer is hereditary. For instance, women in families with Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), have a higher risk for uterine cancer. It is recommended that all women under the age of 60 with endometrial cancer should have their tumor tested for Lynch syndrome even if they have no family history of bowel cancer or other cancers. The presence of Lynch syndrome has important implications for women and their family members. About 2% to 5% of women with endometrial cancer have Lynch syndrome. In the United States, about 1,000 to 2,500 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer each year may have this genetic condition. Read about Lynch syndrome .    Diabetes. Women may have an increased risk of uterine cancer if they have diabetes, which is often associated with obesity (see above).    Other cancers. Women who have had breast cancer, colon cancer, or ovarian cancer have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Tamoxifen. Women taking the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex) to prevent or treat breast cancer have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. The benefits of tamoxifen usually outweigh the risk of developing uterine cancer, but all women who are prescribed tamoxifen should discuss the benefits and risks with their doctor.    Radiation therapy. Women who have had previous radiation therapy for another cancer in the pelvic area, which is the lower part of the abdomen between the hip bones, have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Diet. Women who eat foods high in animal fat may have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Estrogen. Extended exposure to estrogen and/or an imbalance of estrogen is related to many of the following risk factors:   Women who started having their periods before age 12 and/or go through menopause later in life. Learn more about menopause and cancer risk .    Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, especially if they are taking estrogen alone. The risk is lower for women who take estrogen with progesterone, which is another sex hormone.    Women who have never been pregnant.    Prevention  Different factors contribute to different types of cancer. Researchers continue to investigate what factors increase risk for this type of cancer. Although there is no proven way to completely prevent this disease, you may be able to lower your risk. Talk with your doctor for more information about your personal risk of cancer.  Research has shown that certain factors can lower the risk of uterine cancer:   Taking birth control pills. Birth control pills have a combination of estrogen and progesterone that are taken cyclically to produce a monthly menstrual period, which reduces the risk of an overgrowth of the uterine lining, especially when taken over a long period of time.    Using a progestin-secreting intrauterine device (IUD), which is a form of birth control.    Considering the risk of uterine cancer before starting HRT, especially estrogen replacement therapy alone. Using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for HRT may help lower risk.    Maintaining a healthy weight.    If you have diabetes, good disease management, such as regularly monitoring blood glucose levels, can lower risk.   The next section in this guide is Symptoms and Signs .

See what our patients say     Endometrial cancer risk factors  Certain factors may increase a woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer, but they do not always cause the disease. Common risk factors for endometrial cancer include:  General   Age: Most women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are over age 50 and have gone through menopause.  Increased number of menstrual cycles : Women who have had more menstrual cycles in their lifetime have an increased endometrial cancer risk. This includes those who started their periods before age 12 and who went through menopause after age 50.  No prior pregnancies : Researchers are investigating why pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. During pregnancy, a woman’s hormonal balance shifts, with her body producing more progesterone and less estrogen. Irregular menstrual cycles and infertility also may cause imbalances in estrogen and progesterone levels, which may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.   Body   Obesity: Fat tissues tend to produce higher levels of estrogen, particularly after menopause, which increases the endometrial cancer risk for older, overweight women.    Metabolic syndrome : This syndrome occurs when a specific set of conditions develop at the same time, such as extra fat around the abdomen, high blood sugar , high blood pressure , high levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoproteins in the blood.   Other conditions   Diabetes  Endometrial hyperplasia  Ovarian tumors and syndromes   Previous treatment   Estrogen replacement therapy: Replacing estrogen without increasing progesterone levels after menopause may increase a woman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer.  Tamoxifen : Women who are treated with the breast cancer drug tamoxifen have an increased risk of developing this disease.   Genetic risk factors  Heredity plays a key role in the development of certain gynecologic cancers, because damage to genes involving cell growth and DNA repair accumulate over time.  A family history of cancer does not necessarily mean you are at high risk for developing the disease. About 5 percent of uterine cancers are linked to hereditary factors.  If several members of your family have had endometrial cancer or Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) you may be a candidate for genetic testing. Lynch syndrome may be caused by a mutation in any of several mismatch repair genes. These genes are normally responsible repairing damaged DNA. When one of these genes isn’t working, cells may develop mistakes in their DNA, potentially leading to other gene mutations and, eventually, cancer.  Women who inherit mutations in the BRCA genes or the PTEN gene may also be at an increased risk for developing endometrial cancer.

Cancer of the inner lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract. Early symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. Cancer of the inner lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 47,130 new cases of cancer of the uterine body, most of which are endometrial cancers, will be detected in the United States in 2012, resulting in about 8,010 deaths. The good news is that the prognosis is excellent if the cancer is detected and treated early.  The vast majority of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are postmenopausal; more than half of cases occur in women ages 50 to 69. Younger women who develop the condition tend to be obese or have a genetic predisposition. A woman has about a one in 40 chance of developing endometrial cancer during her lifetime.  Unlike ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer has a major, identifiable symptom in its early stages: abnormal vaginal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. This symptom occurs in 90 percent of endometrial cancer cases. Other symptoms include pelvic pressure, a pelvic mass, abnormal discharge that doesn't look like blood, difficulty and pain during urination and pain during intercourse.  The greatest risk factors for developing endometrial cancer are obesity and abnormal precancerous changes of the uterus. Other risks include using estrogen alone, diabetes and a strong family history of colon cancer, particularly a type of colon cancer known as hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, or HNPCC. Additional risks include never having had children, starting having menstrual periods at a young age and having a late menopause. Together, these risks can lead to continued estrogen stimulation of the endometrial tissue. In other words, the tissue continues to grow without a break, which increases the risk of cells growing out of control, leading to precancerous and cancerous lesion of the uterus.  Although endometrial cancer is more common in Caucasian women than African-American women, more African-American women die from the disease. This is due to many factors including the fact that African-American women often have more advanced disease and more aggressive types of the disease when they are diagnosed.  A much less common form of uterine cancer is sarcoma of the uterus, which is extremely aggressive. In this rare form of uterine cancer, cancer cells originate from the muscles or other supporting tissues of the uterus. Women who have received therapy with high-dose X-rays to their pelvis have a high risk for some types of uterine sarcomas.  Many sarcomas of the uterus begin after menopause. The prognosis and choice of treatment depend on the stage of the sarcoma, how fast the cancer cells grow and the woman's general health. Diagnosis The primary symptom of uterine cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially after menopause. Bleeding may be so light that it's only a pink discharge or drainage from the vagina.  Although irregular menstrual periods are common as you get closer to menopause, when hormone levels rise and fall unpredictably, they can also be a symptom of uterine abnormalities or uterine cancer. If your periods stop for several months and then start again, discuss your symptoms with your health care professional and ask for an examination. Also, be sure to mention any menstrual irregularities during regular checkups.  If you are postmenopausal, any vaginal bleeding is abnormal and you should contact your health care professional immediately . The earlier uterine cancer is diagnosed, the better the prognosis.  Whether you are pre- or postmenopausal, the absence of visible blood with any unusual vaginal discharge doesn't mean you don't have uterine cancer. If you experience any abnormal discharge, discuss it with your health care professional.  Also, if you have a family history or have been diagnosed with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), you should be screened for uterine cancer every year beginning at age 35.  Diagnostic tests for uterine cancer include:  Endometrial biopsy .     During this procedure, your doctor inserts a small instrument through your vagina and cervix and uses suction to take a small tissue sample of the uterine lining. The procedure is performed in the doctor's office and, while uncomfortable, is not significantly painful. You may have cramps or pain for a short time afterward. Your doctor will usually recommend taking ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain relievers before and after the procedure. Hysteroscopy. A hysteroscopy allows your health care professional to look inside your uterus. It is usually performed if the endometrial biopsy is inconclusive or symptoms persist. During a hysteroscopy, a tiny telescope is inserted into the uterus through the cervix. The uterus is expanded with saline, allowing the doctor to view and biopsy any abnormalities. Dilation and curettage (D&C) .     If your endometrial biopsy is inconclusive (i.e., if not enough tissue was retrieved), your health care professional may recommend a D&C to remove pieces of the lining of the uterus. During a D&C, the opening of the cervix is dilated and the walls of the uterus are gently scraped to remove any growths. The tissue is then checked for abnormal cells. The procedure is typically performed on an outpatient basis and takes about an hour. It may require general anesthesia or conscious sedation (medication that makes you drowsy, but still awake).  Other tests may include routine blood tests, a urine test and a chest X-ray. If the biopsy or D&C is positive, further evaluation and treatment will be required to remove the cancer and properly assess the extent of disease. In some cases, you may have an ultrasound, a CT scan or other scans before surgery.  In addition, some physicians will order a blood test to check for levels of CA-125, a substance released into the bloodstream by many (but not all) cancers of the endometrium and ovary.   Some physicians will use a CA-125 test to decide whether surgery should be done by a gynecologic oncologist or, if CA-125 levels were high before surgery, as a follow-up to see how well treatment is working. This level can also be used after treatment to follow the cancer growth.  Early diagnosis and treatment of uterine cancer is critical. This type of gynecologic cancer often can be successfully treated in its early stages. Before beginning any treatment, however, you may want to consult with a gynecologic oncologist, a physician who specializes in treating cancers of the reproductive tract. These doctors have the most experience in diagnosing and treating such conditions.  Staging Endometrial Cancer After a diagnosis, your health care professional will "stage" the disease to determine if the disease has spread. The stage of the cancer provides information about treatment options and survival rates.  Stage I:     Cancer is found only in the main part of the uterus. It has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites. Stage II:     Cancer cells have spread to the cervix, but not to the lymph nodes or distant sites. Stage III:     Cancer cells have spread outside the uterus, such as the lymph nodes, fallopian tubes, ovaries or vagina. Stage IV:     Cancer cells have spread beyond the pelvis, to other body parts, into the lining of the bladder or rectum and/or have spread to lymph nodes in the groin. Stage IV endometrial cancer may also have spread to organs farther away from the uterus, such as the lungs, liver or bones. Recurrent:     Recurrent disease means the cancer has come back (recurred) after it has been treated. Share on: Treatment During surgery to remove the uterus, the surgeon will determine the stage of the cancer. The most common treatment is a total or radical hysterectomy, in which the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes in which the tumor commonly spreads are all removed. Other therapies—radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy—may also be used to treat this form of the disease. Ask your health care provider about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial.  Hysterectomy is major surgery requiring one to three days in the hospital. Depending on the stage of your cancer, you may have a total hysterectomy, which involves removal of the whole uterus, cervix ovaries and fallopian tubes or a radical hysterectomy, which involves removal of tissue surrounding the uterus, in addition to removing the uterus and cervix. It can be done through the abdomen or using a more minimally invasive procedure (robotic or laparoscopic). For several days after surgery, you may have problems emptying your bladder and having normal bowel movements. Normal activities, including sex, can be resumed in about four to six weeks. After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods. If your ovaries are removed before menopause, you will immediately enter menopause and usually experience significant menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, moodiness and vaginal dryness. Talk to your health care professionl about whether you can take medications to help reduce any symptoms.  Radiation   therapy involves the use of high-dose X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (called external radiation) or from implanting materials that produce radiation (radioisotopes) through thin plastic tubes into the cancerous area (called internal radiation or brachytherapy). Radiation is sometimes used after surgery depending on the extent of the cancer. If you're unable to have surgery, or the disease is too advanced for surgery, radiation may be the only treatment offered.  Radiation therapy also may be offered before surgery to decrease the extent of disease. During radiation therapy, you may notice a number of side effects. These include skin reactions (redness or dryness) in the area being treated, tiredness, diarrhea, nausea and frequent and uncomfortable urination and/or defecation. Treatment can also cause dryness, itching and burning in the vagina. Sex may be painful, and some women are advised not to have sexual relations during treatment. All symptoms should disappear once treatment ends, and most women can resume sexual activity within a few weeks.  Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. The drugs are typically infused through your veins and travel throughout your body. They're designed to kill all rapidly growing cells, both cancer cells and healthy cells. Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of endometrial cancer, particularly if it's spread beyond the endometrium or if it is a very aggressive type. If chemotherapy is part of your treatment, you will likely be given a combination of drugs, because combination chemotherapy is often more effective than one drug alone. The most common chemotherapy combinations include carboplatin (Paraplatin) with paclitaxel (Taxol) and cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) with doxorubicin (Adriamycin). Your provider may also recommend a clinical trial. Loss of appetite can be a serious problem for women receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Yet nutrition is important because it helps you withstand the side effects of treatment. Eating well means getting enough calories to prevent weight loss and having enough protein in the diet to build and repair skin, hair, muscles and organs. If you have trouble eating right during your treatment, try several small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals, in addition to nutritional supplements. The side effects of cancer therapies vary from person to person and from one treatment to the next. Your health care professional will plan your treatment to minimize side effects. Also remember that most side effects are temporary. Still, it's important to tell your health care professional about any reactions and side effects because he or she may be able to adjust treatments and/or prescribe other options to help you feel better.  Hormone therapy involves the use of female hormones, typically progesterone-like drugs called progestins, to slow the growth of endometrial cancer cells. The two most commonly used progestins for treating endometrial cancer are medroxyprogesterone (Provera) and megestrol acetate (Megace). Side effects of progestins include nausea, vomiting, mild shortness of breath, weakness, hot flashes, menstrual bleeding, headache, insomnia, decreased sex drive and blood clots. The anti-estrogen drug Tamoxifen, which is most often used to treat breast cancer, may also be used to treat advanced-stage or recurrent endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen works to prevent estrogens circulating in your body from stimulating the growth of cancer cells. Side effects of Tamoxifen include blood clots, endometriosis, stroke, fertility issues and thinning of hair and nails. Hormones called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which switch off estrogen production by the ovaries in premenopausal women, may also be used to reduce estrogen levels in women with endometrial cancer who still have their ovaries. By lowering estrogen levels, these drugs, which include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron), work to slow the growth of the cancer. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are injected every one to three months. Side effects include hot flashes, vaginal dryness and other symptoms of menopause. However, most women with endometrial cancer have their ovaries removed as part of treatment or their ovaries destroyed with radiation, which reduces estrogen production and may slow the growth of the cancer.  Regular follow-up exams are very important for any woman who has been treated for cancer of the uterus. Your health care professional will want to watch you closely for several years to be sure that the cancer has not returned. Most follow-up examinations include a pelvic exam and a chest X-ray, possibly a CA-125 test.  When uterine cancer is caught early, the treatment is quite effective and chances of recurrence are small. The likelihood of recurrence goes up relative to the stage of the cancer.  If uterine cancer does recur, it's likely to happen in the first three years after the initial treatment. The best chance of a cure is if the disease recurs in the vagina or is seen during a pelvic exam. That's why you will likely have a pelvic exam every three to four months for the first two years after hysterectomy, then annually; a Pap test every six months for two years, then annually; and a CA-125 test at each visit if your levels were initially elevated. Talk to your health care provider about what's right for you.  Recurrence can also occur in an organ distant from the uterus.  Treatment for recurrent uterine cancer depends on the amount and the location of the cancer. If it is only in the pelvis, radiation therapy alone may be enough. More extensive recurrences may require hormonal therapy or chemotherapy.  Low-grade cancers that contain progesterone receptors are more likely to respond well to hormone therapy than higher grade cancers, which respond better to chemotherapy. If you are diagnosed with recurrent uterine cancer, you may also want to consider participating in clinical trials of new treatments. Prevention Some uterine cancer can be prevented by maintaining a normal weight, preventing diabetes and in some cases preventive surgery. Knowing your risk factors for this gynecologic cancer can help you be more aware of it, as well as try to find ways to avoid continual estrogen stimulation of the uterine lining, also called "unopposed estrogen."  For example, women with a family history of early onset colorectal cancer or other reproductive cancers may have an increased risk for uterine cancer. The cancers in these families may be caused by a genetic predisposition to cancer called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, or HNPCC. Up to 60 percent of women with HNPCC will develop endometrial cancer at some point in their lives. Genetic counseling is recommended for women with a family history of early onset (before age 50) colon, breast, ovary or other cancer caused by a genetic mutation.  The following may help you reduce your risk of developing uterine cancer or identify it early:  Control     your weight and your risk of diabetes by eating healthy foods and exercising. Women who are slim can cut their risk of endometrial cancer by 75 percent compared to obese women. If     you still have your uterus, don't take supplemental estrogen without also taking progestin or progesterone. Report abnormal bleeding promptly to your health care professional and ask for an examination. Know your family history. Share on: Facts to Know Cancer     of the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, is the most common gynecologic cancer and ranks as one of the most treatable when identified in its earliest stages. An estimated 47,130 new cases of cancer of the uterine body are expected to be detected in the United States in 2012, according to the American Cancer Society. More    than half of endometrial cancers are diagnosed in women between the ages of 50 and 69, although endometrial cancer can strike women in their childbearing years.  The majority of uterine cancers develop in the glandular cells, or endometrium, lining the inside of the uterine cavity. This is the same tissue that is shed each month during a normal menstrual period.  A     small number of uterine cancers (about 2 percent) are sarcomas, which can originate in the endometrium or in the muscular and connective tissues of the uterus. There    is evidence that use of oral contraceptives can reduce uterine cancer risk, particularly in women who take oral contraceptives for several years. The protection continues for at least 10 years after you stop taking the pills. You should not take birth control pills just to prevent uterine cancer, however, since they carry their own risks.  Obesity,     precancerous lesions of the uterus and a family history of colon cancer are the strongest risk factors for uterine cancer. Other risk factors include late menopause and never having children.  Uterine     cancer is more common in Caucasians than in African Americans and other non-Caucasian women. On the other hand, African-American women who get this type of cancer are twice as likely to die of the disease. Women     who have been diagnosed with a genetic condition known as hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) have an increased risk of endometrial cancer and should begin screening for the condition at 35. Uterine     cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, depending on the stage and cell type of the disease. Questions to Ask Review the following Questions to Ask about uterine cancer so you're prepared to discuss this important health issue with your health care professional. What are the signs of uterine cancer? What are my risk factors for getting uterine cancer? If I'm diagnosed with this disease, what treatment do you recommend and why? What risks are associated with those treatments? Will I be able to work or will I be at home in bed? For how long? What should I do about diet and exercise while I'm getting treatments? Will I be able to have children after my treatment? What's my prognosis? If I go through all the treatments, what are the chances that the cancer will return? If the cancer returns, what should I do? Share on: Key Q&A I am 40 years old and have abnormal bleeding. What are the chances that it's uterine cancer? Abnormal uterine bleeding has many causes. Thyroid and adrenal gland conditions, for example, can cause hormonal imbalances that affect menstrual periods. Fibroids, polyps, scar tissue, infection, trauma, atrophy and precancerous conditions also can cause irregular menstrual bleeding. You may also find that you are just beginning to experience the menstrual irregularities common to the years just prior to menopause, when hormone levels fluctuate unpredictably. However, your symptoms could be something more serious. Discuss your symptoms as soon as possible with your health care professional. My health care professional said she suspects that I could have uterine cancer. What kind of test will tell for sure? If cancer is suspected, a tissue sample must be taken from inside your uterus. This procedure is called an endometrial biopsy and can usually be done in the health care professional's office with minimal discomfort. Narrow instruments and suction tools are used to take the sample. You may have cramps or pain for a short time after the procedure. I have uterine cancer and have been told I need a hysterectomy. Does that mean my sex life is over? Absolutely not. In fact, your interest in and enjoyment of sex may increase. Ask your health care professional when you may begin sexual activity after surgery. Because your vagina may be shorter, you and your partner may want to experiment with different positions to find one that is comfortable. Foreplay may enable the vagina to lengthen before intercourse. If your ovaries are also removed during your hysterectomy (called oophorectomy) and you are premenopausal, you will go through sudden menopause and experience menopausal symptoms that can interfere with your sex life, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, moodiness, insomnia and night sweats. Beginning therapy soon after hysterectomy and oophorectomy can reduce or alleviate these symptoms, and there are other options. Discuss the risks and benefits associated with hormone therapy with your health care professional. What are my chances of survival after surgery? With early diagnosis and treatment, up to 90 percent of women with endometrial cancer survive for five years.

The number of deaths was 4.6 per 100,000 women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 2.8 percent of women will be diagnosed with uterine cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 710,228 women living with uterine cancer in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Uterine Cancer?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  81.3%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from uterine cancer. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.   Additional Information   More about 5-year survival rates   Survival by Stage  Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant . The earlier uterine cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving five years after being diagnosed. For uterine cancer, 66.9% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year survival for localized uterine cancer is 95.3%.

The endometrium is the lining of the uterus, a  hollow, muscular organ in a woman’s pelvis. In most non-pregnant women, the  uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the  cervix, which leads to the vagina.

Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the uterus. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ in women where fetal development occurs.  Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining (endometrium) of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer is often detected at an early stage because it frequently produces abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts women to see their doctors. If endometrial cancer is discovered early, removing the uterus surgically often cures endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer care at Mayo Clinic      Symptoms Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer may include:   Vaginal bleeding after menopause  Bleeding between periods  An abnormal, watery or blood-tinged discharge from your vagina  Pelvic pain   When to see a doctor  Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you, such as vaginal bleeding or discharge not related to your periods, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Doctors don't know what causes endometrial cancer. What's known is that something occurs to create a genetic mutation within cells in the endometrium — the lining of the uterus.  The genetic mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die at a set time. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).  Risk factors    Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.     Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include:    Changes in the balance of female hormones in the body. Your ovaries make two main female hormones — estrogen and progesterone. Fluctuations in the balance of these hormones cause changes in your endometrium.  A disease or condition that increases the amount of estrogen, but not the level of progesterone, in your body can increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Examples include irregular ovulation patterns, such as those that can occur in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Taking hormones after menopause that contain estrogen but not progesterone increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  A rare type of ovarian tumor that secretes estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.   More years of menstruation. Starting menstruation at an early age — before age 12 — or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.  Never having been pregnant. Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than do women who have had at least one pregnancy.  Older age. As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often in women who have undergone menopause.  Obesity. Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may occur because excess body fat alters your body's balance of hormones.  Hormone therapy for breast cancer. Women with breast cancer who take the hormone therapy drug  tamoxifen have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, discuss this risk with your doctor. For most women, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.  An inherited colon cancer syndrome. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a syndrome that increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. HNPCC occurs because of a gene mutation passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with HNPCC, discuss your risk of the genetic syndrome with your doctor. If you've been diagnosed with HNPCC, ask your doctor what cancer screening tests you should undergo.   Prevention To reduce your risk of endometrial cancer, you may wish to:   Talk to your doctor about the risks of hormone therapy after menopause. If you're considering hormone replacement therapy to help control menopause symptoms, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Unless you've undergone a hysterectomy, replacing estrogen alone after menopause may increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk. Hormone therapy carries other risks, such as a possible increase in the risk of breast cancer, so weigh the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Consider taking birth control pills. Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk. The risk reduction is thought to last for several years after you stop taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives have side effects, though, so discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, increase your physical activity and reduce the number of calories you eat each day.  Exercise most days of the week. Exercise may reduce your risk of endometrial cancer. Add physical activity into your daily routine. Try to exercise 30 minutes most days of the week. If you can exercise more, that's even better.

Endometrial Cancer  About Endometrial Cancer             Key Statistics for Endometrial Cancer       How common is endometrial cancer?  In the United States, cancer of the endometrium is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs. The American Cancer Society estimates for cancer of the uterus in the United States for 2018 are:   About 63,230 new cases of cancer of the body of the uterus (uterine body or corpus) will be diagnosed.  About 11,350 women will die from cancers of the uterine body.   These estimates include both endometrial cancers and uterine sarcomas. Up to 8% of uterine body cancers are sarcomas, so the actual numbers for endometrial cancer cases and deaths are slightly lower than these estimates.  Lifetime chance of getting endometrial cancer  Endometrial cancer affects mainly postmenopausal women. The average age of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer is 60. It is uncommon in women under the age of 45.  This cancer is slightly more common in white women, but black women are more likely to die from it. There are more than 600,000 survivors of endometrial cancer.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

Credit: National Cancer Institute     Pap smear tests, which screen for cervical cancer, may help identify ovarian and uterine cancer as well, a new study suggests.  That's because the cervical fluid collected during a Pap smear can contain cells, including cancer cells, that have been shed from theovaries or endometrium (the lining of the uterus). During the study, researchers developed a test to look for genetic markers of ovarian and endometrial cancers that were present in the cervical fluid. (The new test requires cervical fluid from a Pap smear, but analyzes it in a different way than does the test for cervical cancer.)  Among women already known to have these cancers, the test correctly identified 100 percent of endometrial cancers, and 41 percent of ovarian cancers. Fourteen healthy women also had the test, and none were identify as having cancer.  Currently, there are no recommended screening tests for ovarian or endometrial cancer. Proposed screening tests for these cancers, such as a blood test for ovarian cancer , often turn up false positive results, meaning they identify "red flags" that turn out not to be cancer.  The new test, or one like it, might one day be used to screen for ovarian and endometrial cancer, but the researchers stress much more work needs to be done before this could happen. Researchers need to study the test in a much larger group of women, and investigate whether or not it can find cancer in its earliest stages.  In the United States, about 15,000 women die from ovarian cancer and 8,000 die from endometrial cancer each year. Symptoms of ovarian cancer are vague, and women with the disease are often not diagnosed until the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. [See 5 Things Women Should Know About Ovarian Cancer .]   Endometrial cancer is typically diagnosed early when symptoms such as vaginal bleeding occur.  During a Pap smear, doctors use a brush to collect samples of cells from the cervix, which are then studied under a microscope for signs of cancer. Recently, researchers have started testing cervical samples for DNA from human papillomavirus, or HPV, a virus that can cause cervical cancer.  Using a method similar to HPV testing , the new test looks for DNA from ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. To create the test, the researchers identified genes that are frequently mutated in ovarian and endometrial cancer. The test, known as PapGene, screens for these abnormal genes.  The researchers tested PapGene on Pap smear samples from 22 women with ovarian cancer and 24 women with endometrial cancer. The test identified all 24 endometrial cancers, and nine out of 22 ovarian cancers.  The cost of PapGene could be similar to that for HPV testing, which is about $100, the researchers said.  A few changes might improve the ability of PapGene to detect ovarian cancer, such as inserting the cervical brush deeper into the cervical canal during a Pap smear, or finding more genetic markers of the disease, said study researcher Dr. Chetan Bettegowda, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University.  But it could be that the biology of ovarian cancer may not always lend itself to this type of testing. "Perhaps only a proportion of ovarian cancers would have cells or DNA that are shed in sufficient quantities for detection [in the cervix]," Dr. Shannon Westin, a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and colleagues, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.  The study and editorial are published today (Jan. 9) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the uterus. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ in women where fetal development occurs.  Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining (endometrium) of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer is often detected at an early stage because it frequently produces abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts women to see their doctors. If endometrial cancer is discovered early, removing the uterus surgically often cures endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer care at Mayo Clinic      Symptoms Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer may include:   Vaginal bleeding after menopause  Bleeding between periods  An abnormal, watery or blood-tinged discharge from your vagina  Pelvic pain   When to see a doctor  Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you, such as vaginal bleeding or discharge not related to your periods, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Doctors don't know what causes endometrial cancer. What's known is that something occurs to create a genetic mutation within cells in the endometrium — the lining of the uterus.  The genetic mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die at a set time. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).  Risk factors    Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.     Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include:    Changes in the balance of female hormones in the body. Your ovaries make two main female hormones — estrogen and progesterone. Fluctuations in the balance of these hormones cause changes in your endometrium.  A disease or condition that increases the amount of estrogen, but not the level of progesterone, in your body can increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Examples include irregular ovulation patterns, such as those that can occur in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Taking hormones after menopause that contain estrogen but not progesterone increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  A rare type of ovarian tumor that secretes estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.   More years of menstruation. Starting menstruation at an early age — before age 12 — or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.  Never having been pregnant. Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than do women who have had at least one pregnancy.  Older age. As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often in women who have undergone menopause.  Obesity. Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may occur because excess body fat alters your body's balance of hormones.  Hormone therapy for breast cancer. Women with breast cancer who take the hormone therapy drug  tamoxifen have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, discuss this risk with your doctor. For most women, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.  An inherited colon cancer syndrome. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a syndrome that increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. HNPCC occurs because of a gene mutation passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with HNPCC, discuss your risk of the genetic syndrome with your doctor. If you've been diagnosed with HNPCC, ask your doctor what cancer screening tests you should undergo.   Prevention To reduce your risk of endometrial cancer, you may wish to:   Talk to your doctor about the risks of hormone therapy after menopause. If you're considering hormone replacement therapy to help control menopause symptoms, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Unless you've undergone a hysterectomy, replacing estrogen alone after menopause may increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk. Hormone therapy carries other risks, such as a possible increase in the risk of breast cancer, so weigh the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Consider taking birth control pills. Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk. The risk reduction is thought to last for several years after you stop taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives have side effects, though, so discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, increase your physical activity and reduce the number of calories you eat each day.  Exercise most days of the week. Exercise may reduce your risk of endometrial cancer. Add physical activity into your daily routine. Try to exercise 30 minutes most days of the week. If you can exercise more, that's even better.

Use the menu to see other pages.  A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices.  The following factors may raise a woman’s risk of developing uterine cancer:   Age. Uterine cancer most often occurs in women over 50; the average age is 60.    Obesity. Fatty tissue in women who are overweight produces additional estrogen, a sex hormone that can increase the risk of uterine cancer. This risk increases with an increase in body mass index (BMI), which is the ratio of a person's weight to height. About 40% of uterine cancer cases are linked to obesity.    Race. White women are more likely to develop uterine cancer than women of other races/ethnicities. However, black women have a higher chance of developing advanced cancer. Black and Hispanic women also have a higher risk of developing aggressive tumors.    Genetics. Uterine cancer may run in families where colon cancer is hereditary. For instance, women in families with Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), have a higher risk for uterine cancer. It is recommended that all women under the age of 60 with endometrial cancer should have their tumor tested for Lynch syndrome even if they have no family history of bowel cancer or other cancers. The presence of Lynch syndrome has important implications for women and their family members. About 2% to 5% of women with endometrial cancer have Lynch syndrome. In the United States, about 1,000 to 2,500 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer each year may have this genetic condition. Read about Lynch syndrome .    Diabetes. Women may have an increased risk of uterine cancer if they have diabetes, which is often associated with obesity (see above).    Other cancers. Women who have had breast cancer, colon cancer, or ovarian cancer have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Tamoxifen. Women taking the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex) to prevent or treat breast cancer have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. The benefits of tamoxifen usually outweigh the risk of developing uterine cancer, but all women who are prescribed tamoxifen should discuss the benefits and risks with their doctor.    Radiation therapy. Women who have had previous radiation therapy for another cancer in the pelvic area, which is the lower part of the abdomen between the hip bones, have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Diet. Women who eat foods high in animal fat may have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Estrogen. Extended exposure to estrogen and/or an imbalance of estrogen is related to many of the following risk factors:   Women who started having their periods before age 12 and/or go through menopause later in life. Learn more about menopause and cancer risk .    Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, especially if they are taking estrogen alone. The risk is lower for women who take estrogen with progesterone, which is another sex hormone.    Women who have never been pregnant.    Prevention  Different factors contribute to different types of cancer. Researchers continue to investigate what factors increase risk for this type of cancer. Although there is no proven way to completely prevent this disease, you may be able to lower your risk. Talk with your doctor for more information about your personal risk of cancer.  Research has shown that certain factors can lower the risk of uterine cancer:   Taking birth control pills. Birth control pills have a combination of estrogen and progesterone that are taken cyclically to produce a monthly menstrual period, which reduces the risk of an overgrowth of the uterine lining, especially when taken over a long period of time.    Using a progestin-secreting intrauterine device (IUD), which is a form of birth control.    Considering the risk of uterine cancer before starting HRT, especially estrogen replacement therapy alone. Using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for HRT may help lower risk.    Maintaining a healthy weight.    If you have diabetes, good disease management, such as regularly monitoring blood glucose levels, can lower risk.   The next section in this guide is Symptoms and Signs .

Endometrial Cancer  Causes, Risks Factors, and Prevention             Endometrial Cancer Risk Factors   A risk factor is anything that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.  Although certain factors increase a woman's risk for developing endometrial cancer, they do not always cause the disease. Many women with one or more risk factors never develop endometrial cancer.  Some women with endometrial cancer do not have any known risk factors. Even if a woman with endometrial cancer has one or more risk factors, there is no way to know which, if any, of these factors was responsible for her cancer.  Several factors influence the risk of developing endometrial cancer, including:   Things that affect hormone levels, like taking estrogen after menopause, birth control pills, or tamoxifen; the number of menstrual cycles (over a lifetime), pregnancy, obesity, certain ovarian tumors, and polycystic ovarian syndrome  Use of an intrauterine device  Age  Diet and exercise  Diabetes  Family history (having close relatives with endometrial or colorectal cancer)  Having been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer in the past  Having been diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia in the past  Treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis to treat another cancer   Some of these, like pregnancy, birth control pills, and the use of an intrauterine device are linked to a lower risk of endometrial cancer, while many are linked to a higher risk. These factors and how they affect endometrial cancer risk are discussed in more detail below.  Hormone factors  A woman's hormone balance plays a part in the development of most endometrial cancers. Many of the risk factors for endometrial cancer affect estrogen levels. Before menopause, the ovaries are the major source of the 2 main types of female hormones -- estrogen and progesterone.  The balance between these hormones changes during a woman's menstrual cycle each month. This produces a woman's monthly periods and keeps the endometrium healthy. A shift in the balance of these hormones toward more estrogen increases a woman's risk for developing endometrial cancer.  After menopause, the ovaries stop making these hormones, but a small amount of estrogen is still made naturally in fat tissue. Estrogen from fat tissue has a bigger impact after menopause than it does before menopause.  Estrogen therapy  Treating the symptoms of menopause with hormones is known as menopausal hormone therapy (or sometimes hormone replacement therapy). Estrogen is the major part of this treatment. Estrogen treatment can reduce hot flashes, improve vaginal dryness, and help prevent the weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) that can occur with menopause.  Doctors have found, however, that using estrogen alone (without progesterone) can lead to type I endometrial cancer in women who still have a uterus. To lower that risk , a progestin (progesterone or a drug like it) must be given along with estrogen. This approach is called combination hormone therapy.  Women who take progesterone along with estrogen to treat menopausal symptoms do not have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Still, taking this combination increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and also increases the risk of serious blood clots.  If you are taking (or plan to take) hormones after menopause, it is important to discuss the possible risks (including cancer, blood clots, heart attacks, and stroke) with your doctor.  Like any other medicine, hormones should be used only at the lowest dose that is needed and for the shortest possible time to control symptoms. As with any other medicine you take for a long time, you’ll need to see your doctor regularly. Experts recommend yearly follow-up pelvic exams. If you have any abnormal bleeding or discharge from the vagina you should see your doctor or other health care provider right away (and not wait for a check-up).  For more information about the cancer risks from taking hormones after menopause, see Menopausal Hormone Therapy and Cancer Risk .  Birth control pills  Using birth control pills (oral contraceptives) lowers the risk of endometrial cancer. The risk is lowest in women who take the pill for a long time, and this protection continues for at least 10 years after a woman stops taking this form of birth control. However, it is important to look at all of the risks and benefits when choosing a contraceptive method; endometrial cancer risk is only one factor to be considered. It's a good idea to discuss the pros and cons of different types of birth control with your doctor.  Total number of menstrual cycles  Having more menstrual cycles during a woman's lifetime raises her risk of endometrial cancer. Starting menstrual periods (menarche) before age 12 and/or going through menopause later in life raises the risk. Starting periods early is less a risk factor for women with early menopause. Likewise, late menopause may not lead to a higher risk in women whose periods began later in their teens.  Pregnancy  The hormonal balance shifts toward more progesterone during pregnancy. So having many pregnancies protects against endometrial cancer. Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk, especially if they were also infertile (unable to become pregnant).  Obesity  A woman's ovaries produce most of her estrogen, but fat tissue can change some other hormones (called androgens ) into estrogens. Having more fat tissue can increase a woman's estrogen levels, which increases her endometrial cancer risk. In comparison with women who maintain a healthy weight, endometrial cancer is twice as common in overweight women, and more than three times as common in obese women.  Tamoxifen  Tamoxifen is a drug that is used to prevent and treat  breast cancer . Tamoxifen acts as an anti-estrogen in breast tissue, but it acts like an estrogen in the uterus. In women who have gone through menopause, it can cause the uterine lining to grow, which increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  The risk of developing endometrial cancer from tamoxifen is low (less than 1% per year). Women taking tamoxifen must balance this risk against the benefits of this drug in treating and preventing breast cancer. This is an issue women should discuss with their doctors. If you are taking tamoxifen, you should have yearly gynecologic exams and should be sure to report any abnormal bleeding, as this could be a sign of endometrial cancer.  Ovarian tumors  A certain type of ovarian tumor, the granulosa cell tumor , often makes estrogen. Estrogen release by one of these tumors is not controlled the way hormone release from the ovaries is, and can sometimes lead to high estrogen levels. The resulting hormone imbalance can stimulate the endometrium and even lead to endometrial cancer. In fact, sometimes vaginal bleeding from endometrial cancer is the first symptom of one of these tumors.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome  Women with a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have abnormal hormone levels, such as higher androgen (male hormones) and estrogen levels and lower levels of progesterone. The increase in estrogen relative to progesterone can increase a woman's chance of getting endometrial cancer. PCOS is also a leading cause of infertility in women.  Using an intrauterine device  Women who used an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control seem to have a lower risk of getting endometrial cancer. Information about this protective effect is limited to IUDs that do not contain hormones. Researchers have not yet studied whether newer types of IUDs that release progesterone have any effect on endometrial cancer risk. However, these IUDs are sometimes used to treat pre-cancers and early endometrial cancers in women who wish to preserve child-bearing ability.  Age  The risk of endometrial cancer increases as a woman gets older.  Diet and exercise  A high-fat diet can increase the risk of several cancers, including endometrial cancer. Because fatty foods are also high-calorie foods, a high-fat diet can lead to obesity, which is a well-known endometrial cancer risk factor. Many scientists think this is the main way in which a high-fat diet raises endometrial cancer risk. Some scientists think that fatty foods may also have a direct effect on estrogen metabolism, which increases endometrial cancer risk.  Physical activity lowers the risk of endometrial cancer. Several studies found that women who exercised more had a lower risk of endometrial cancer, while in one study women who spent more time sitting had a higher risk. To learn more, you can read the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention .  Diabetes  Endometrial cancer may be as much as 4 times more common in women with diabetes. Diabetes is more common in people who are overweight, but even people with diabetes who are not overweight have a higher risk of endometrial cancer.  Family history  Endometrial cancer tends to run in some families. Some of these families also have an inherited tendency to develop colon cancer . This disorder is called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Another name for HNPCC is Lynch syndrome. In most cases, this disorder is caused by a defect in either the mismatch repair gene MLH1 or the gene MSH2 . But at least 5 other genes can cause HNPCC: MLH3 , MSH6 , TGBR2 , PMS1 , and PMS2. An abnormal copy of any one of these genes reduces the body's ability to repair damage to its DNA or regulate cell growth. This results in a very high risk of colon cancer, as well as a high risk of endometrial cancer. Women with this syndrome have a 40% to 60% risk of developing endometrial cancer at some point. The risk of ovarian cancer is also increased. General information about inherited cancer syndromes can be found in Family Cancer Syndromes .  Some families have a high rate of only endometrial cancer. These families may have a different genetic disorder that hasn't been discovered yet.  Breast or ovarian cancer  Women who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer may have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer, too. Some of the dietary, hormonal, and reproductive risk factors for breast and ovarian cancer also increase endometrial cancer risk.  Endometrial hyperplasia  Endometrial hyperplasia is an increased growth of the endometrium. Mild or simple hyperplasia, the most common type, has a very small risk of becoming cancerous. It may go away on its own or after treatment with hormone therapy. If the hyperplasia is called “atypical,” it has a higher chance of becoming a cancer. Simple atypical hyperplasia turns into cancer in about 8% of cases if it’s not treated. If it’s not treated, complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) has a risk of becoming cancerous in up to 29% of cases, and the risk of having an undetected endometrial cancer is even higher. For this reason, CAH is usually treated. (Treatment is discussed in the section Can endometrial cancer be prevented? )  Prior pelvic radiation therapy  Radiation used to treat some other cancers can damage the DNA of cells, sometimes increasing the risk of a second type of cancer such as endometrial cancer.

Use the menu to see other pages.  A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices.  The following factors may raise a woman’s risk of developing uterine cancer:   Age. Uterine cancer most often occurs in women over 50; the average age is 60.    Obesity. Fatty tissue in women who are overweight produces additional estrogen, a sex hormone that can increase the risk of uterine cancer. This risk increases with an increase in body mass index (BMI), which is the ratio of a person's weight to height. About 40% of uterine cancer cases are linked to obesity.    Race. White women are more likely to develop uterine cancer than women of other races/ethnicities. However, black women have a higher chance of developing advanced cancer. Black and Hispanic women also have a higher risk of developing aggressive tumors.    Genetics. Uterine cancer may run in families where colon cancer is hereditary.

Women who have had breast cancer, colon cancer, or ovarian cancer have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Tamoxifen. Women taking the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex) to prevent or treat breast cancer have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. The benefits of tamoxifen usually outweigh the risk of developing uterine cancer, but all women who are prescribed tamoxifen should discuss the benefits and risks with their doctor.    Radiation therapy. Women who have had previous radiation therapy for another cancer in the pelvic area, which is the lower part of the abdomen between the hip bones, have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Diet. Women who eat foods high in animal fat may have an increased risk of uterine cancer.    Estrogen.

Having one risk factor for cancers of the uterus, or even several, does not necessarily mean you will get the disease. Likewise, having no common risk factors doesn't mean you won't develop cancer. Some risk factors, like being overweight and having high blood sugar, may be addressed through lifestyle changes .                   Endometrial cancer risk factors     Uterine sarcoma risk factors      Inherited risk for cancer   Researchers have identified some inherited gene mutations that are known to contribute to the development of certain types of cancer.

See what our patients say     Endometrial cancer risk factors  Certain factors may increase a woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer, but they do not always cause the disease. Common risk factors for endometrial cancer include:  General   Age: Most women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are over age 50 and have gone through menopause.  Increased number of menstrual cycles : Women who have had more menstrual cycles in their lifetime have an increased endometrial cancer risk. This includes those who started their periods before age 12 and who went through menopause after age 50.  No prior pregnancies : Researchers are investigating why pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. During pregnancy, a woman’s hormonal balance shifts, with her body producing more progesterone and less estrogen. Irregular menstrual cycles and infertility also may cause imbalances in estrogen and progesterone levels, which may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.   Body   Obesity: Fat tissues tend to produce higher levels of estrogen, particularly after menopause, which increases the endometrial cancer risk for older, overweight women.    Metabolic syndrome : This syndrome occurs when a specific set of conditions develop at the same time, such as extra fat around the abdomen, high blood sugar , high blood pressure , high levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoproteins in the blood.   Other conditions   Diabetes  Endometrial hyperplasia  Ovarian tumors and syndromes   Previous treatment   Estrogen replacement therapy: Replacing estrogen without increasing progesterone levels after menopause may increase a woman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer.  Tamoxifen : Women who are treated with the breast cancer drug tamoxifen have an increased risk of developing this disease.   Genetic risk factors  Heredity plays a key role in the development of certain gynecologic cancers, because damage to genes involving cell growth and DNA repair accumulate over time.  A family history of cancer does not necessarily mean you are at high risk for developing the disease. About 5 percent of uterine cancers are linked to hereditary factors.  If several members of your family have had endometrial cancer or Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) you may be a candidate for genetic testing. Lynch syndrome may be caused by a mutation in any of several mismatch repair genes. These genes are normally responsible repairing damaged DNA. When one of these genes isn’t working, cells may develop mistakes in their DNA, potentially leading to other gene mutations and, eventually, cancer.  Women who inherit mutations in the BRCA genes or the PTEN gene may also be at an increased risk for developing endometrial cancer.

Cancer of the inner lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract. Early symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. Cancer of the inner lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 47,130 new cases of cancer of the uterine body, most of which are endometrial cancers, will be detected in the United States in 2012, resulting in about 8,010 deaths. The good news is that the prognosis is excellent if the cancer is detected and treated early.  The vast majority of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are postmenopausal; more than half of cases occur in women ages 50 to 69. Younger women who develop the condition tend to be obese or have a genetic predisposition. A woman has about a one in 40 chance of developing endometrial cancer during her lifetime.  Unlike ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer has a major, identifiable symptom in its early stages: abnormal vaginal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. This symptom occurs in 90 percent of endometrial cancer cases. Other symptoms include pelvic pressure, a pelvic mass, abnormal discharge that doesn't look like blood, difficulty and pain during urination and pain during intercourse.  The greatest risk factors for developing endometrial cancer are obesity and abnormal precancerous changes of the uterus. Other risks include using estrogen alone, diabetes and a strong family history of colon cancer, particularly a type of colon cancer known as hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, or HNPCC. Additional risks include never having had children, starting having menstrual periods at a young age and having a late menopause. Together, these risks can lead to continued estrogen stimulation of the endometrial tissue. In other words, the tissue continues to grow without a break, which increases the risk of cells growing out of control, leading to precancerous and cancerous lesion of the uterus.  Although endometrial cancer is more common in Caucasian women than African-American women, more African-American women die from the disease. This is due to many factors including the fact that African-American women often have more advanced disease and more aggressive types of the disease when they are diagnosed.  A much less common form of uterine cancer is sarcoma of the uterus, which is extremely aggressive. In this rare form of uterine cancer, cancer cells originate from the muscles or other supporting tissues of the uterus. Women who have received therapy with high-dose X-rays to their pelvis have a high risk for some types of uterine sarcomas.  Many sarcomas of the uterus begin after menopause. The prognosis and choice of treatment depend on the stage of the sarcoma, how fast the cancer cells grow and the woman's general health. Diagnosis The primary symptom of uterine cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially after menopause. Bleeding may be so light that it's only a pink discharge or drainage from the vagina.  Although irregular menstrual periods are common as you get closer to menopause, when hormone levels rise and fall unpredictably, they can also be a symptom of uterine abnormalities or uterine cancer. If your periods stop for several months and then start again, discuss your symptoms with your health care professional and ask for an examination. Also, be sure to mention any menstrual irregularities during regular checkups.  If you are postmenopausal, any vaginal bleeding is abnormal and you should contact your health care professional immediately . The earlier uterine cancer is diagnosed, the better the prognosis.  Whether you are pre- or postmenopausal, the absence of visible blood with any unusual vaginal discharge doesn't mean you don't have uterine cancer. If you experience any abnormal discharge, discuss it with your health care professional.  Also, if you have a family history or have been diagnosed with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), you should be screened for uterine cancer every year beginning at age 35.  Diagnostic tests for uterine cancer include:  Endometrial biopsy .     During this procedure, your doctor inserts a small instrument through your vagina and cervix and uses suction to take a small tissue sample of the uterine lining. The procedure is performed in the doctor's office and, while uncomfortable, is not significantly painful. You may have cramps or pain for a short time afterward. Your doctor will usually recommend taking ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain relievers before and after the procedure. Hysteroscopy. A hysteroscopy allows your health care professional to look inside your uterus. It is usually performed if the endometrial biopsy is inconclusive or symptoms persist. During a hysteroscopy, a tiny telescope is inserted into the uterus through the cervix. The uterus is expanded with saline, allowing the doctor to view and biopsy any abnormalities. Dilation and curettage (D&C) .     If your endometrial biopsy is inconclusive (i.e., if not enough tissue was retrieved), your health care professional may recommend a D&C to remove pieces of the lining of the uterus. During a D&C, the opening of the cervix is dilated and the walls of the uterus are gently scraped to remove any growths. The tissue is then checked for abnormal cells. The procedure is typically performed on an outpatient basis and takes about an hour. It may require general anesthesia or conscious sedation (medication that makes you drowsy, but still awake).  Other tests may include routine blood tests, a urine test and a chest X-ray. If the biopsy or D&C is positive, further evaluation and treatment will be required to remove the cancer and properly assess the extent of disease. In some cases, you may have an ultrasound, a CT scan or other scans before surgery.  In addition, some physicians will order a blood test to check for levels of CA-125, a substance released into the bloodstream by many (but not all) cancers of the endometrium and ovary.   Some physicians will use a CA-125 test to decide whether surgery should be done by a gynecologic oncologist or, if CA-125 levels were high before surgery, as a follow-up to see how well treatment is working. This level can also be used after treatment to follow the cancer growth.  Early diagnosis and treatment of uterine cancer is critical. This type of gynecologic cancer often can be successfully treated in its early stages. Before beginning any treatment, however, you may want to consult with a gynecologic oncologist, a physician who specializes in treating cancers of the reproductive tract. These doctors have the most experience in diagnosing and treating such conditions.  Staging Endometrial Cancer After a diagnosis, your health care professional will "stage" the disease to determine if the disease has spread. The stage of the cancer provides information about treatment options and survival rates.  Stage I:     Cancer is found only in the main part of the uterus. It has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites. Stage II:     Cancer cells have spread to the cervix, but not to the lymph nodes or distant sites. Stage III:     Cancer cells have spread outside the uterus, such as the lymph nodes, fallopian tubes, ovaries or vagina. Stage IV:     Cancer cells have spread beyond the pelvis, to other body parts, into the lining of the bladder or rectum and/or have spread to lymph nodes in the groin. Stage IV endometrial cancer may also have spread to organs farther away from the uterus, such as the lungs, liver or bones. Recurrent:     Recurrent disease means the cancer has come back (recurred) after it has been treated. Share on: Treatment During surgery to remove the uterus, the surgeon will determine the stage of the cancer. The most common treatment is a total or radical hysterectomy, in which the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes in which the tumor commonly spreads are all removed. Other therapies—radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy—may also be used to treat this form of the disease. Ask your health care provider about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial.  Hysterectomy is major surgery requiring one to three days in the hospital. Depending on the stage of your cancer, you may have a total hysterectomy, which involves removal of the whole uterus, cervix ovaries and fallopian tubes or a radical hysterectomy, which involves removal of tissue surrounding the uterus, in addition to removing the uterus and cervix. It can be done through the abdomen or using a more minimally invasive procedure (robotic or laparoscopic). For several days after surgery, you may have problems emptying your bladder and having normal bowel movements. Normal activities, including sex, can be resumed in about four to six weeks. After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods. If your ovaries are removed before menopause, you will immediately enter menopause and usually experience significant menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, moodiness and vaginal dryness. Talk to your health care professionl about whether you can take medications to help reduce any symptoms.  Radiation   therapy involves the use of high-dose X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (called external radiation) or from implanting materials that produce radiation (radioisotopes) through thin plastic tubes into the cancerous area (called internal radiation or brachytherapy). Radiation is sometimes used after surgery depending on the extent of the cancer. If you're unable to have surgery, or the disease is too advanced for surgery, radiation may be the only treatment offered.  Radiation therapy also may be offered before surgery to decrease the extent of disease. During radiation therapy, you may notice a number of side effects. These include skin reactions (redness or dryness) in the area being treated, tiredness, diarrhea, nausea and frequent and uncomfortable urination and/or defecation. Treatment can also cause dryness, itching and burning in the vagina. Sex may be painful, and some women are advised not to have sexual relations during treatment. All symptoms should disappear once treatment ends, and most women can resume sexual activity within a few weeks.  Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. The drugs are typically infused through your veins and travel throughout your body. They're designed to kill all rapidly growing cells, both cancer cells and healthy cells. Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of endometrial cancer, particularly if it's spread beyond the endometrium or if it is a very aggressive type. If chemotherapy is part of your treatment, you will likely be given a combination of drugs, because combination chemotherapy is often more effective than one drug alone. The most common chemotherapy combinations include carboplatin (Paraplatin) with paclitaxel (Taxol) and cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) with doxorubicin (Adriamycin). Your provider may also recommend a clinical trial. Loss of appetite can be a serious problem for women receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Yet nutrition is important because it helps you withstand the side effects of treatment. Eating well means getting enough calories to prevent weight loss and having enough protein in the diet to build and repair skin, hair, muscles and organs. If you have trouble eating right during your treatment, try several small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals, in addition to nutritional supplements. The side effects of cancer therapies vary from person to person and from one treatment to the next. Your health care professional will plan your treatment to minimize side effects. Also remember that most side effects are temporary. Still, it's important to tell your health care professional about any reactions and side effects because he or she may be able to adjust treatments and/or prescribe other options to help you feel better.  Hormone therapy involves the use of female hormones, typically progesterone-like drugs called progestins, to slow the growth of endometrial cancer cells. The two most commonly used progestins for treating endometrial cancer are medroxyprogesterone (Provera) and megestrol acetate (Megace). Side effects of progestins include nausea, vomiting, mild shortness of breath, weakness, hot flashes, menstrual bleeding, headache, insomnia, decreased sex drive and blood clots. The anti-estrogen drug Tamoxifen, which is most often used to treat breast cancer, may also be used to treat advanced-stage or recurrent endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen works to prevent estrogens circulating in your body from stimulating the growth of cancer cells. Side effects of Tamoxifen include blood clots, endometriosis, stroke, fertility issues and thinning of hair and nails. Hormones called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which switch off estrogen production by the ovaries in premenopausal women, may also be used to reduce estrogen levels in women with endometrial cancer who still have their ovaries. By lowering estrogen levels, these drugs, which include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron), work to slow the growth of the cancer. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are injected every one to three months. Side effects include hot flashes, vaginal dryness and other symptoms of menopause. However, most women with endometrial cancer have their ovaries removed as part of treatment or their ovaries destroyed with radiation, which reduces estrogen production and may slow the growth of the cancer.  Regular follow-up exams are very important for any woman who has been treated for cancer of the uterus. Your health care professional will want to watch you closely for several years to be sure that the cancer has not returned. Most follow-up examinations include a pelvic exam and a chest X-ray, possibly a CA-125 test.  When uterine cancer is caught early, the treatment is quite effective and chances of recurrence are small. The likelihood of recurrence goes up relative to the stage of the cancer.  If uterine cancer does recur, it's likely to happen in the first three years after the initial treatment. The best chance of a cure is if the disease recurs in the vagina or is seen during a pelvic exam. That's why you will likely have a pelvic exam every three to four months for the first two years after hysterectomy, then annually; a Pap test every six months for two years, then annually; and a CA-125 test at each visit if your levels were initially elevated. Talk to your health care provider about what's right for you.  Recurrence can also occur in an organ distant from the uterus.  Treatment for recurrent uterine cancer depends on the amount and the location of the cancer. If it is only in the pelvis, radiation therapy alone may be enough. More extensive recurrences may require hormonal therapy or chemotherapy.  Low-grade cancers that contain progesterone receptors are more likely to respond well to hormone therapy than higher grade cancers, which respond better to chemotherapy. If you are diagnosed with recurrent uterine cancer, you may also want to consider participating in clinical trials of new treatments. Prevention Some uterine cancer can be prevented by maintaining a normal weight, preventing diabetes and in some cases preventive surgery. Knowing your risk factors for this gynecologic cancer can help you be more aware of it, as well as try to find ways to avoid continual estrogen stimulation of the uterine lining, also called "unopposed estrogen."  For example, women with a family history of early onset colorectal cancer or other reproductive cancers may have an increased risk for uterine cancer. The cancers in these families may be caused by a genetic predisposition to cancer called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, or HNPCC. Up to 60 percent of women with HNPCC will develop endometrial cancer at some point in their lives. Genetic counseling is recommended for women with a family history of early onset (before age 50) colon, breast, ovary or other cancer caused by a genetic mutation.  The following may help you reduce your risk of developing uterine cancer or identify it early:  Control     your weight and your risk of diabetes by eating healthy foods and exercising. Women who are slim can cut their risk of endometrial cancer by 75 percent compared to obese women. If     you still have your uterus, don't take supplemental estrogen without also taking progestin or progesterone. Report abnormal bleeding promptly to your health care professional and ask for an examination. Know your family history. Share on: Facts to Know Cancer     of the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, is the most common gynecologic cancer and ranks as one of the most treatable when identified in its earliest stages. An estimated 47,130 new cases of cancer of the uterine body are expected to be detected in the United States in 2012, according to the American Cancer Society. More    than half of endometrial cancers are diagnosed in women between the ages of 50 and 69, although endometrial cancer can strike women in their childbearing years.  The majority of uterine cancers develop in the glandular cells, or endometrium, lining the inside of the uterine cavity. This is the same tissue that is shed each month during a normal menstrual period.  A     small number of uterine cancers (about 2 percent) are sarcomas, which can originate in the endometrium or in the muscular and connective tissues of the uterus. There    is evidence that use of oral contraceptives can reduce uterine cancer risk, particularly in women who take oral contraceptives for several years. The protection continues for at least 10 years after you stop taking the pills. You should not take birth control pills just to prevent uterine cancer, however, since they carry their own risks.  Obesity,     precancerous lesions of the uterus and a family history of colon cancer are the strongest risk factors for uterine cancer. Other risk factors include late menopause and never having children.  Uterine     cancer is more common in Caucasians than in African Americans and other non-Caucasian women. On the other hand, African-American women who get this type of cancer are twice as likely to die of the disease. Women     who have been diagnosed with a genetic condition known as hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) have an increased risk of endometrial cancer and should begin screening for the condition at 35. Uterine     cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, depending on the stage and cell type of the disease. Questions to Ask Review the following Questions to Ask about uterine cancer so you're prepared to discuss this important health issue with your health care professional. What are the signs of uterine cancer? What are my risk factors for getting uterine cancer? If I'm diagnosed with this disease, what treatment do you recommend and why? What risks are associated with those treatments? Will I be able to work or will I be at home in bed? For how long? What should I do about diet and exercise while I'm getting treatments? Will I be able to have children after my treatment? What's my prognosis? If I go through all the treatments, what are the chances that the cancer will return? If the cancer returns, what should I do? Share on: Key Q&A I am 40 years old and have abnormal bleeding. What are the chances that it's uterine cancer? Abnormal uterine bleeding has many causes. Thyroid and adrenal gland conditions, for example, can cause hormonal imbalances that affect menstrual periods. Fibroids, polyps, scar tissue, infection, trauma, atrophy and precancerous conditions also can cause irregular menstrual bleeding. You may also find that you are just beginning to experience the menstrual irregularities common to the years just prior to menopause, when hormone levels fluctuate unpredictably. However, your symptoms could be something more serious. Discuss your symptoms as soon as possible with your health care professional. My health care professional said she suspects that I could have uterine cancer. What kind of test will tell for sure? If cancer is suspected, a tissue sample must be taken from inside your uterus. This procedure is called an endometrial biopsy and can usually be done in the health care professional's office with minimal discomfort. Narrow instruments and suction tools are used to take the sample. You may have cramps or pain for a short time after the procedure. I have uterine cancer and have been told I need a hysterectomy. Does that mean my sex life is over? Absolutely not. In fact, your interest in and enjoyment of sex may increase. Ask your health care professional when you may begin sexual activity after surgery. Because your vagina may be shorter, you and your partner may want to experiment with different positions to find one that is comfortable. Foreplay may enable the vagina to lengthen before intercourse. If your ovaries are also removed during your hysterectomy (called oophorectomy) and you are premenopausal, you will go through sudden menopause and experience menopausal symptoms that can interfere with your sex life, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, moodiness, insomnia and night sweats. Beginning therapy soon after hysterectomy and oophorectomy can reduce or alleviate these symptoms, and there are other options. Discuss the risks and benefits associated with hormone therapy with your health care professional. What are my chances of survival after surgery? With early diagnosis and treatment, up to 90 percent of women with endometrial cancer survive for five years.

The number of deaths was 4.6 per 100,000 women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 2.8 percent of women will be diagnosed with uterine cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 710,228 women living with uterine cancer in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Uterine Cancer?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  81.3%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from uterine cancer. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.   Additional Information   More about 5-year survival rates   Survival by Stage  Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant . The earlier uterine cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving five years after being diagnosed. For uterine cancer, 66.9% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year survival for localized uterine cancer is 95.3%.

The endometrium is the lining of the uterus, a  hollow, muscular organ in a woman’s pelvis. In most non-pregnant women, the  uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the  cervix, which leads to the vagina.

Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the uterus. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ in women where fetal development occurs.  Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining (endometrium) of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer is often detected at an early stage because it frequently produces abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts women to see their doctors. If endometrial cancer is discovered early, removing the uterus surgically often cures endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer care at Mayo Clinic      Symptoms Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer may include:   Vaginal bleeding after menopause  Bleeding between periods  An abnormal, watery or blood-tinged discharge from your vagina  Pelvic pain   When to see a doctor  Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you, such as vaginal bleeding or discharge not related to your periods, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Doctors don't know what causes endometrial cancer. What's known is that something occurs to create a genetic mutation within cells in the endometrium — the lining of the uterus.  The genetic mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die at a set time. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).  Risk factors    Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.     Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include:    Changes in the balance of female hormones in the body. Your ovaries make two main female hormones — estrogen and progesterone. Fluctuations in the balance of these hormones cause changes in your endometrium.  A disease or condition that increases the amount of estrogen, but not the level of progesterone, in your body can increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Examples include irregular ovulation patterns, such as those that can occur in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Taking hormones after menopause that contain estrogen but not progesterone increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  A rare type of ovarian tumor that secretes estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.   More years of menstruation. Starting menstruation at an early age — before age 12 — or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.  Never having been pregnant. Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than do women who have had at least one pregnancy.  Older age. As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often in women who have undergone menopause.  Obesity. Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may occur because excess body fat alters your body's balance of hormones.  Hormone therapy for breast cancer. Women with breast cancer who take the hormone therapy drug  tamoxifen have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, discuss this risk with your doctor. For most women, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.  An inherited colon cancer syndrome. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a syndrome that increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. HNPCC occurs because of a gene mutation passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with HNPCC, discuss your risk of the genetic syndrome with your doctor. If you've been diagnosed with HNPCC, ask your doctor what cancer screening tests you should undergo.   Prevention To reduce your risk of endometrial cancer, you may wish to:   Talk to your doctor about the risks of hormone therapy after menopause. If you're considering hormone replacement therapy to help control menopause symptoms, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Unless you've undergone a hysterectomy, replacing estrogen alone after menopause may increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk. Hormone therapy carries other risks, such as a possible increase in the risk of breast cancer, so weigh the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Consider taking birth control pills. Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk. The risk reduction is thought to last for several years after you stop taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives have side effects, though, so discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.  Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, increase your physical activity and reduce the number of calories you eat each day.  Exercise most days of the week. Exercise may reduce your risk of endometrial cancer. Add physical activity into your daily routine. Try to exercise 30 minutes most days of the week. If you can exercise more, that's even better.
