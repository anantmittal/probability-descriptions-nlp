Implied Probability is also useful when evaluating a bet or checking how likely an outcome is.   Fractions Used primarily in the UK and Ireland, fractions quote the potential profit should the bet succeed, relative to the stake. 
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 2/1 the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 2) and the total returned is £15 (£10 plus the £5 stake).  Decimals Decimals quote the potential return should the bet succeed, relative to the stake.
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 3 the total returned is £15 (£5 * 3) the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 3 minus the £5 stake).  American   Positive figures: The odds state the winnings on a £100 bet e.g. american odds of 110 would win £110 on a £100 bet.  Negative figures: The odds state how much must be bet to win £100 profit e.g. american odds of -90 would win £100 on a £90 bet.    Implied Probability Odds correlate to probability e.g a 3/1 bet is expected to win one in every 4 attempts, hence the probability is 25%.    Also See   Betting Calculator -

Odds Is Related to Probability    The formal way to describe the odds is as the probability of the event divided by the probability of the non-event . So odds are the ratio of two fractions :  the number of events divided by the number of subjects ( the probability of the event ) and  that fraction divided by the number of non-events divided by the number of subjects ( the probability of the non-event ).  So the formula for odds is p / (1 - p).  Since both fractions have the number of subjects in the denominator,  they reduce to our first presentation of odds as the number of events divided by the number of non-events.   Probability and Odds   If event occurs 1 of 5 times, probability = 0.2    Probability = 1/5 = 0.2   Out of 5 times, 1 time will be the event and 4 times will be the non-event, odds = 0.25    Odds = 1/5 / 4/5 = 1/4 = 0.25  Calculating the odds without the number of subjects:  by the ratio of the number of events (1)  by the number of non-events (4)   odds = 1/4 = 0.25    Calculating Probability Given Odds   To calculate probability given the odds:    Probability = odds/1+ odds To go in the other direction from odds to probability:  Divide the odds by 1 + odds.  In this example, (1/4) / (1+1/4) =  (1/4) / (5/4) =  1/5, the probability    Odds versus Probability   Odds is less intuitive than probability (probably wouldn't say "my odds of dying are 1/4")   No less legitimate mathematically, just not so easily understood   Also important because the log odds of the outcome is given by the coefficient of a predictor in a logistic regression   In multivariate analysis of a dichotomous outcome logistic regression is used and the coefficients, the betas, from a logistic regression give the odds ratio by raising e to the beta (exponentiating it on the natural logarithm scale).

(January 2011)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In poker , pot odds are the ratio of the current size of the pot to the cost of a contemplated call . [1] Pot odds are often compared to the probability of winning a hand with a future card in order to estimate the call's expected value .     Contents    1  Converting odds ratios to and from percentages  2  Using pot odds to determine expected value  3  Implied pot odds   3.1  Example (Texas Hold'em)    4  Reverse implied pot odds   4.1  Limit Texas hold'em example    5  Manipulating pot odds   5.1  No-limit Texas hold 'em example    6  Bluffing frequency  7  See also  8  Notes  9  References     Converting odds ratios to and from percentages [ edit ]  Odds are most commonly expressed as ratios, but converting them to percentages will often make them easier to work with. The ratio has two numbers: the size of the pot and the cost of the call. To convert this ratio to the equivalent percentage, we add these two numbers together and then divide the cost of the call by this sum. For example, the pot is $30, and the cost of the call is $10. The pot odds in this situation are 30:10, or 3:1 when simplified. To get the percentage, we add 30 and 10 to get a sum of 40 and then divide 10 by 40, giving us 0.25, or 25%.  To convert any percentage or fraction to the equivalent odds, we subtract the numerator from the denominator and then divide this difference by the numerator. For example, to convert 25%, or 1/4, we subtract 1 from 4 to get 3 (or 25 from 100 to get 75) and then divide 3 by 1 (or 75 by 25), giving us 3, or 3:1.  Requires revision: Converting a fraction or percentage to equivalent odds is much simpler than the above stated process. In other words, 25% as a ratio is 1:4, not 3:1 which is 300%.  See also: Fractional odds  Using pot odds to determine expected value [ edit ]  When a player holds a drawing hand (a hand that is behind now but is likely to win if a certain card is drawn) pot odds are used to determine the expected value of that hand when the player is faced with a bet.  The expected value of a call is determined by comparing the pot odds to the odds of drawing a card that wins the pot. When the odds of drawing a card that wins the pot are numerically higher than the pot odds, the call has a positive expectation; on average, you win a portion of the pot that is greater than the cost of the call. Conversely, if the odds of drawing a winning card are numerically lower than the pot odds, the call has a negative expectation, and you can expect to win less money on average than it costs to call the bet.  Implied pot odds [ edit ]  Implied pot odds , or simply implied odds , are calculated the same way as pot odds, but take into consideration estimated future betting. Implied odds are calculated in situations where the player expects to fold in the following round if the draw is missed, thereby losing no additional bets, but expects to gain additional bets when the draw is made. Since the player expects to always gain additional bets in later rounds when the draw is made, and never lose any additional bets when the draw is missed, the extra bets that the player expects to gain, excluding his own, can fairly be added to the current size of the pot. This adjusted pot value is known as the implied pot.  Example (Texas Hold'em) [ edit ]  On the turn, Alice's hand is certainly behind, and she faces a $1 call to win a $10 pot against a single opponent. There are four cards remaining in the deck that make her hand a certain winner. Her probability of drawing one of those cards is therefore 4/47 (8.5%), which when converted to odds is 10.75:1. Since the pot lays 10:1 (9.1%), Alice will on average lose money by calling if there is no future betting. However, Alice expects her opponent to call her additional $1 bet on the final betting round if she makes her draw. Alice will fold if she misses her draw and thus lose no additional bets. Alice's implied pot is therefore $11 ($10 plus the expected $1 call to her additional $1 bet), so her implied pot odds are 11:1 (8.3%). Her call now has a positive expectation.  Reverse implied pot odds [ edit ]  Reverse implied pot odds , or simply reverse implied odds , apply to situations where a player will win the minimum if holding the best hand but lose the maximum if not having the best hand. Aggressive actions (bets and raises) are subject to reverse implied odds, because they win the minimum if they win immediately (the current pot), but may lose the maximum if called (the current pot plus the called bet or raise). These situations may also occur when a player has a made hand with little chance of improving what is believed to be currently the best hand, but an opponent continues to bet. An opponent with a weak hand will be likely to give up after the player calls and not call any bets the player makes. An opponent with a superior hand, will, on the other hand, continue, (extracting additional bets or calls from the player).  Limit Texas hold'em example [ edit ]  With one card to come, Alice holds a made hand with little chance of improving and faces a $10 call to win a $30 pot. If her opponent has a weak hand or is bluffing, Alice expects no further bets or calls from her opponent. If her opponent has a superior hand, Alice expects the opponent to bet another $10 on the end. Therefore, if Alice wins, she only expects to win the $30 currently in the pot, but if she loses, she expects to lose $20 ($10 call on the turn plus $10 call on the river). Because she is risking $20 to win $30, Alice's reverse implied pot odds are 1.5-to-1 ($30/$20) or 40 percent (1/(1.5+1)). For calling to have a positive expectation, Alice must believe the probability of her opponent having a weak hand is over 40 percent.  Manipulating pot odds [ edit ]  Often a player will bet to manipulate the pot odds offered to other players. A common example of manipulating pot odds is make a bet to protect a made hand that discourages opponents from chasing a drawing hand .  No-limit Texas hold 'em example [ edit ]  With one card to come, Bob has a made hand, but the board shows a potential flush draw. Bob wants to bet enough to make it wrong for an opponent with a flush draw to call, but Bob does not want to bet more than he has to in the event the opponent already has him beat. How much should Bob bet?  Assume a $20 pot and one opponent. If Bob bets $10 (half the pot), when his opponent acts, the pot will be $30 and it will cost $10 to call. The opponent's pot odds will be 3-to-1, or 25 percent. If the opponent is on a flush draw (9/46, approximately 19.565 percent or 4.11-to-1 odds against with one card to come), the pot is not offering adequate pot odds for the opponent to call unless the opponent thinks he can induce additional final round betting from Bob if the opponent completes his flush draw (see implied pot odds).  A bet of $6.43, resulting in pot odds of 4.11-to-1, would make his opponent mathematically indifferent to calling if implied odds are disregarded.  Bluffing frequency [ edit ]  Further information: Bluff (poker)  According to David Sklansky , game theory shows that a player should bluff a percentage of the time equal to his opponent's pot odds to call the bluff. For example, in the final betting round, if the pot is $30 and a player is contemplating a $30 bet (which will give his opponent 2-to-1 pot odds for the call), the player should bluff half as often as he would bet for value (one out of three times).  However, this conclusion does not take into account some of the context of specific situations. A player's bluffing frequency often accounts for many different factors, particularly the tightness or looseness of their opponents. Bluffing against a tight player is more likely to induce a fold than bluffing against a loose player, who is more likely to call the bluff. Sklansky's strategy is an equilibrium strategy in the sense that it is optimal against someone playing an optimal strategy against it.

In most contexts, there is no particular reason to prefer one over the other. Most scientists tend to feel more comfortable thinking about probabilities than odds, but that is a matter of training and custom, not logic.  The distinction is simple:   The probability that an event will occur is the fraction of times you expect to see that event in many trials. Probabilities always range between 0 and 1.  The odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur.   A probability of 0 is the same as odds of 0. Probabilities between 0 and 0.5 equal odds less than 1.0. A probability of 0.5 is the same as odds of 1.0. Think of it this way: The probability of flipping a coin to heads is 50%. The odds are “fifty: fifty,” which equals 1.0.  As the probability goes up from 0.5 to 1.0, the odds increase from 1.0 to approach infinity. For example, if the probability is 0.75, then the odds are 75:25, three to one, or 3.0.  If the odds are high (million to one), the probability is almost 1.00. If the odds are tiny (one to a million), the probablility is tiny, almost zero.  Converting between odds and probability is straightforward:   To convert from a probability to odds, divide the probability by one minus that probability. So if the probability is 10% or 0.10 , then the odds are 0.1/0.9 or ‘1 to 9’ or 0.111.  To convert from odds to a probability, divide the odds by one plus the odds. So to convert odds of 1/9 to a probability, divide 1/9 by 10/9 to obtain the probability of 0.10.             Need to learn Prism 7?

They are often used interchangeably in causal conversation or even in published material . However, they are not mathematically equivalent because they are looking at likeliness in different contexts. In everyday conversation when numbers or values aren’t given, the two terms are synonymous . If an event has a high probability, then it has high odds for happening. The incorrect usage arises when a person ascribes a mathematical value to either the odds or probability they are discussing. Hopefully, if you aren’t quite sure what the exact mathematical difference is, this will clear it up for you.  Probability is defined as the fraction of desired outcomes in the context of every possible outcome with a value between 0 and 1, where 0 would be an impossible event and 1 would represent an inevitable event. Probabilities are usually given as percentages. [ie. 50% probability that a coin will land on HEADS.] Odds can have any value from zero to infinity and they represent a ratio of desired outcomes versus the field. Odds are a ratio, and can be given in two different ways: ‘odds in favor’ and ‘odds against’. ‘Odds in favor’ are odds describing the if an event will occur, while ‘odds against’ will describe if an event will not occur. If you are familiar with gambling, ‘odds against’ are what Vegas gives as odds. More on that later. For the coin flip odds in favor of a HEADS outcome is 1:1, not 50%.  Visual Math  Simple probability of event A occurring is mathematically defined as:  $latex P(A) = \frac{Number \ of \ Event \ A}{Total \ Number \ of \ Events}&s=2$  The best way to illustrate this is with the classic marbles-in-a-bag example. The graphic below depicts all the marbles in an opaque bag that one marble will be pulled out of. There are 6 blue, 3 red, 2 yellow, and 1 green for a total of 12 marbles in the bag.   The probability of pulling a red marble would be calculated by taking the total number of red marbles and dividing it by the total number of marbles.   OR  $latex P(RED) = \frac{3 \ RED \ marbles}{12 \ TOTAL \ marbles} = 25\%&s=2$.  Notice that the probability calculation includes the red marbles in the denominator of the calculation, because probability considers the context of the entire event space. Odds, on the other hand, are the ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes. The denominator contains ONLY the marbles that aren’t the favorable outcomes. Odds uses the contexts of good outcomes and bad outcomes. Written as fractions, these two values are completely different. Probability is 1/4 while odds in favor are 1/3. You can see how mistakenly interchanging the terms could give the wrong information. The ‘odds in favor’ of RED would be mathematically calculated by   OR  $latex Odds\_Favor(RED) = \frac{3 \ RED \ marbles}{9 \ NOT \ RED \ marbles} = 1:3&s=2$.  To find ‘odds against’ you would simply flip odds in favor upside down and this describes the odds of the event not occurring.   OR  $latex Odds\_Against(RED) = \frac{9 \ NOT \ RED \ marbles}{3 \ RED \ marbles} = 3:1&s=2$.  Gambling  ‘Odds against’ are commonly are used in the context of gambling. When you hear that the Seattle Seahawks Vegas odds to win the Super Bowl are 5:1 [Retrieved 9/19/2014], the 5:1 is referring to the ‘odds against’ Seattle winning the Super Bowl. Using some quick math we could determine the probability of Seattle winning the Super Bowl would be 1/6 or 16.7%.  Vegas odds are technically payoff odds, because they describe the payout if you were to win the bet. The payout on the Seahawks would win you $5 for every $1 bet on the Seattle winning the Super Bowl. They aren’t true odds, since no one is really sure what the true odds are, because you can’t simply count and weigh the possibilities like with the bag of marbles. The payoff will increase when the event becomes less likely. If you could create a reliable predictive model that told you the Seahawks actually had a 20% probability to win the Super Bowl, you could bet on the Seahawks, knowing that their actual probability to win is better than what Vegas is giving them. And if you made enough bets like this you could beat Vegas.  Mathematical Relationship  I stated earlier that probability and odds were colloquially interchangeable when values aren’t given. This is true, because the two are mathematically related. Odds can be computed from probability and probability from odds.  $latex P(A) = \frac{Odds\_Favor(A)}{1 + Odds\_Favor(A)}&s=2$  $latex Odds\_Favor(A) = \frac{P(A)}{1 – P(A)}&s=2$  Using the RED marble example [P(RED) = 1/4 and Odds_Favor(RED) = 1/3] we can demonstrate how these are equivalent:  $latex P(RED) = \frac{1/3}{1 + 1/3} = \frac{1/3}{4/3} = \frac{1}{4}&s=2$  $latex Odds\_Favor(RED) = \frac{1/4}{1 – 1/4} = \frac{1/4}{3/4} = \frac{1}{3}&s=2$   featured marbles odds odds against odds in favor probability stats   Post navigation   Previous Post MLB — Run Distribution Per Game & Per Inning — Negative Binomial Next Post Do MLB Playoff Odds Work?

How do bookmakers make money        How to calculate implied probability in betting     Learning how to calculate implied probability from betting odds is key to assessing the potential value in a betting market.  Implied probability is a conversion of betting odds into a percentage. It takes into account the bookmaker margin to express the expected probability of an outcome occurring.  Knowing how to convert betting odds into implied probabilities is fundamental for betting as it helps you assess the potential value on a particular market. Once converted, if the implied probability is less than your assessment, then it represents betting value .  The most common odds formats are decimal, American and fractional. The formulas below explain how to convert odds to implied probabilities.  For the examples below we will use Smarkets odds for the 2016 Australian Open final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic:     Player  Decimal odds  Fractional odds  American odds  Implied probability    Djokovic  1.20  1/5  - 500  83.3%    Murray  5.50  9/2  +450  18.1%     Converting decimal odds to implied probability  To calculate the implied probability from decimal odds the equation is:  (1/ decimal odds) * 100 = implied probability  So to find out the probability of a Murray win would be:  (1 / 5.50) * 100 = 18.1%  Therefore, according to the decimal odds of 5.50, Andy Murray had an 18.1% chance of winning.  Converting fractional odds to implied probability  To calculate the implied probability from fractional odds the equation is:  denominator / (denominator + numerator) * 100 = implied probability  Therefore to find out the probability of a Murray win would simply be:  2 / (2 + 9) * 100 = 18.1%  As you can see this is the same probability as with the decimal odds. Why? Because odds in any format are just a different display of the same chance.  Converting American odds to implied probability  There are two instances of American odds (positive and negative) which require separate calculations.  Converting negative American odds  The equation to convert negative American odds is:  Negative American odds / (Negative American odds + 100) * 100 = implied probability  To find out the probability of a Djokovic win:  500 / (500+100) * 100 = 83.3%  Converting positive American odds  The equation to convert positive American odds is:  100 / (positive American odds + 100) * 100 = implied probability  To calculate the probability of a Murray win would be:  100 / (450 + 100) * 100 = 18.1%  Apply this to betting  Now you understand how to calculate the implied probability behind the odds, you can identify potential value in a betting market. If the bookmaker/exchange implied probability is less than your own assessed probability, that outcome represents a value betting opportunity.

Implied Probability is also useful when evaluating a bet or checking how likely an outcome is.   Fractions Used primarily in the UK and Ireland, fractions quote the potential profit should the bet succeed, relative to the stake. 
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 2/1 the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 2) and the total returned is £15 (£10 plus the £5 stake).  Decimals Decimals quote the potential return should the bet succeed, relative to the stake.
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 3 the total returned is £15 (£5 * 3) the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 3 minus the £5 stake).  American   Positive figures: The odds state the winnings on a £100 bet e.g. american odds of 110 would win £110 on a £100 bet.  Negative figures: The odds state how much must be bet to win £100 profit e.g. american odds of -90 would win £100 on a £90 bet.    Implied Probability Odds correlate to probability e.g a 3/1 bet is expected to win one in every 4 attempts, hence the probability is 25%.    Also See   Betting Calculator -

Probability is an estimate of the relative average frequency with which an event occurs in repeated independent trials. The relative frequency is always between 0% (the event never occurs) and 100% (the event always occurs). Probability gives us a tool to predict how often an event will occur, but does not allow us to predict when exactly an event will occur. Probability can also be used to determine the conditions for obtaining certain results or the long-term financial prospects of a particular game; it may also help determine if a particular game is worth playing. It is often expressed as odds, a fraction or a decimal fraction (also known as a proportion). Probability and odds are slightly different ways of describing a player’s chances of winning a bet.   Note: This page is excerpted from Probability, Random Events, and the Mathematics of Gambling . References can be found on page 24 of the PDF available for download below.    Probability, Random Events, and the Mathematics of Gambling    Download PDF     Probability  Probability is an estimate of the chance of winning divided by the total number of chances available. Probability is an ordinary fraction (e.g., 1/4) that can also be expressed as a percentage (e.g., 25%) or as a proportion between 0 and 1 (e.g., p = 0.25). If there are four tickets in a draw and a player owns one of them, his or her probability of winning is 1 in 4 or 1/4 or 25% or p = 0.25.  Odds  Odds are ratios of a player’s chances of losing to his or her chances of winning, or the average frequency of a loss to the average frequency of a win. If a player owns 1 of 4 tickets, his/her probability is 1 in 4 but his/her odds are 3 to 1. That means that there are 3 chances of losing and only 1 chance of winning. To convert odds to probability, take the player’s chance of winning, use it as the numerator and divide by the total number of chances, both winning and losing. For example, if the odds are 4 to 1, the probability equals 1 / (1 + 4) = 1/5 or 20%. Odds of 1 to 1 (50%) are called “evens,” and a payout of 1 to 1 is called “even money.” Epidemiologists use odds ratios to describe the risk for contracting a disease (e.g., a particular group of people might be 2.5 times more likely to have cancer than the rest of the population).  In gambling, “odds” rarely mean the actual chance of a win. Most of the time, when the word “odds” is used, it refers to a subjective estimate of the odds rather than a precise mathematical computation. Furthermore, the odds posted by a racetrack or bookie will not be the “true odds,” but the payout odds. The true odds are the actual chances of winning, whereas the payout odds are the ratio of payout for each unit bet. A favourite horse might be quoted at odds of 2 to 1, which mathematically would represent a probability of 33.3%, but in this case the actual meaning is that the track estimates that it will pay $2 profit for every $1 bet. A long shot (a horse with a low probability of winning) might be quoted at 18 to 1 (a mathematical probability of 5.3%), but these odds do not reflect the probability that the horse will win, they mean only that the payout for a win will be $18 profit for every $1 bet. When a punter says “those are good odds,” he or she is essentially saying that the payout odds compensate for the true odds against a horse winning. The true odds of a horse are actually unknown, but most often the true odds against a horse winning are longer (a lower chance of a win) than the payout odds (e.g., payout odds = 3 to 1; true odds = 5 to 1).  The posted odds of a horse actually overestimate the horse’s chance of winning to ensure that the punter is underpaid for a win.  Equally Likely Outcomes  Central to probability is the idea of equally likely outcomes (Stewart, 1989). Each side of a die or coin is equally likely to come up. Probability, however, does not always seem to be about events that are equally likely. For example, the bar symbol on a slot machine might have a probability of 25%, while a double diamond might have a probability of 2%. This does not actually contradict the idea of equally likely outcomes. Instead, think of the 25% as 25 chances and the 2% as two chances, for a total of 27 chances out of 100. Each of those 27 chances is equally likely. As another example, in rolling two dice there are 36 possible outcomes: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1) . . . (6, 6); and each of these combinations is equally likely to happen. A player rolling 2 dice, however, is most likely to get a total of 7 because there are six ways to make a 7 from the two dice: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2) and (6, 1). A player is least likely to get a total of either 2 or 12 because there is only one way to make a 2 (1, 1) and one way to make a 12 (6, 6).  Independence of Events  A basic assumption in probability theory is that each event is independent of all other events. That is, previous draws have no influence on the next draw. A popular catch phrase is “the dice have no memory.” A die or roulette ball cannot look back and determine that it is due for a 6 or some other number. How could a coin decide to turn up a head after 20 tails? Each event is independent and therefore the player can never predict what will come up next. If a fair coin was flipped 5 times and came up heads 5 times in a row, the next flip could be either heads or tails. The fact that heads have come up 5 times in a row has no influence on the next flip. It is wise not to treat something that is very very unlikely as if it were impossible (see Turner, 1998). In fact, if a coin is truly random, it must be possible for heads to come up 1 million times in a row. Such an event is extraordinarily unlikely, p = 1/2 1,000,000 , but possible. Even then, the next flip is just as likely to be heads as it is tails. Nonetheless, many people believe that a coin corrects itself; if heads comes up too often, they think tails is due.  To complicate matters, however, there are cases where random events are not completely independent. With cards, the makeup of the deck is altered as cards are drawn from the deck. As a result, the value of subsequent cards is constrained by what has already been drawn. Nonetheless, each of the cards that remains in the deck is still equally probable. If, for example, there are only six cards left in a deck, four 7's and two 8's, a 7 is twice as likely to be drawn as an 8, but the specific card, the 7 of spades, has the same probability of being drawn as the 8 of diamonds.  Opportunities Abound  Another key aspect to computing probability is factoring in the number of opportunities for something to occur. The more opportunities there are, the more likely it is that an event will occur. The more tickets a player buys or the more often a player buys them, the greater the player’s chances of winning. At the same time, the more tickets purchased, the greater the average expected loss. One thousand tickets means 1,000 opportunities to win, so that the chance of winning Lotto 6/49 goes from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 14,000. However, because the expected return is nearly always negative, the player will still lose money, on average, no matter how many tickets the player purchases. This is true whether the player buys several tickets for the same draw or one ticket for every draw. Adding more opportunities (e.g., more tickets, bingo cards or slot machines) increases a player’s chance of a win, but does not allow him/her to beat the odds.  Combinations  One final aspect of probability is the fact that the likelihood of two events occurring in combination is always less than the probability of either event occurring by itself. Friday occurs, once every 7 days (1/7) and the 13th day of the month comes once per month (about 1/30 on average). Friday the 13th, however, only occurs roughly once in 210 days (7 x 30) or once or twice per year.  To compute the joint probability of an event, multiply the probability of each of the two events. For example, the chances of rolling a 4 with a single dice are 1/6, or 16.7%. The chances of rolling a 4 two times in a row are: 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 (2.78%). The chances of rolling a 4 three times in a row is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/216 (0.46%). It is important to note, however, that the joint probability of two events occurring refers only to events that have not happened yet. If something has already happened, then its chance of occurring is 100% because it has already happened. If the number 4 came up on the last two rolls, the chances of rolling another 4 are 1/6 not 1/216 because the new formula is 1 x 1 x 1/6, not 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6. Each event is an independent event. In addition, the chances of any number coming up twice in a row are 1/6, not 1/36. This is because there are six possible ways (opportunities) of getting the same number twice in a row: (1/6 x 1/6) x 6 = 6/36 = 1/6.  It is the cumulative and multiplicative aspects of probability that lead people to overestimate their chances of winning. People tend to underestimate the chance of getting one or two of the same symbols on a slot machine because they do not take into account the number of opportunities. A number of studies have shown that people can unconsciously learn probability through experience (Reber, 1993). Suppose the chances of getting a diamond on a slot machine are 1 in 32 on each of three reels. The chance of getting at least one diamond is 3 (the number of reels) x 1/32 = 9.4%. That is, the player will see a diamond on the payline roughly one time every 10.6 spins. But their chances of getting three diamonds would be 1/32 x 1/32 x 1/32 = 1/ 32,768 = 0.003%. Because we occasionally see one (9.4%) or two (0.3%) winning symbols on the payline, we may overestimate the chances of getting three of the big win symbols. This overestimation of the odds is also likely enhanced by seeing the big win symbols spin by on each spin, the occurrence of big win symbols above or below the payline, the distortion of the apparent odds caused by virtual reel mapping, and the larger number of big win symbols on the first two reels (see Turner & Horbay, 2004).  Law of Averages and the Law of Large Numbers  Part of the explanation for the persistent belief among those who gamble that there are patterns in chance, may stem from a misunderstanding of two related “laws” of statistics: the law of averages and the law of large numbers. The first is an informal folk theory of statistics; the second is a statistical law. These laws can be summarized as follows:   Law of Averages: Things average out over time.   Law of Large Numbers: As the sample size increases the average of the actual outcomes will more closely approximate the mathematical probability.  The law of large numbers is a useful way to understand betting outcomes. A coin on average will come up heads 50% of the time. It could nonetheless come up heads 100% of the time or 0% of the time. In a short trial, heads may easily come up on every flip. The larger the number of flips, however, the closer the percentage will be to 50%.  The law of averages is an informal approximation of the law of large numbers. The problem with the law of averages, as it is often understood, is that people assume that if something has not happened it is due to happen. For example, a person who gambles might expect that if heads have come up 10 times in a row, the next flip is more likely to be tails because the flips have to average out to 50%. Many people believe that deviations from chance are corrected by subsequent events and refer to the law of averages in support of their belief. Turner, Wiebe, Falkowski-Ham, Kelly and Skinner (2005) found that 36% of the general population believes that after 5 heads in a row the next flip is more likely to be tails. The law of large numbers, on the other hand, asserts only that the average converges towards the true mean as more observations are added. The average is not somehow corrected to ensure it reflects the expected average. The key difference is in the expectation. After a streak of 10 heads in a row, the law of averages would predict that more tails should come up so that the average is balanced out. The law of large numbers only predicts that after a sufficiently large number of trials, the streak of 10 heads in a row will be statistically irrelevant and the average will be close to the mathematical probability.  Some people accept the idea that the measured average will reflect the probability percentage in the long run, but still expect that if a trial of coin tosses began with a streak of heads, after a million flips extra tails would have to have occurred for the measured average to be close to 50%. One individual argued that there had to be a “bias” in favour of tails to get the average back to 50%. This is still incorrect. According to the law of large numbers, it is not the actual number of flips that converges to the probability percentage, but the average number of flips. Suppose we start by getting 10 heads in a row and keep flipping the coin 1 million times. Does the difference of 10 go away? No. In fact, after 1 million flips the number of heads and tails could differ by as much as 1 or 2 thousand. Even a difference of 9,000 more tails than heads would still round off to 50% after one million flips. Consequently, the individual cannot use deviations from the expected average to get an edge.  It is important to realize that this “law” is really only a statement that summarizes what has been observed, most of the time, over a large (in theory, infinite) number of events. It says absolutely nothing about what will happen next or is likely to happen. Suppose a coin was tossed and the first 10 coin tosses resulted in the following sequence of heads and tails: T, H, H, H, H, H, T, H, H, H (20% tails, 80% heads). If the next 40 trials resulted in 19 tails and 21 heads (47.5% tails and 52.5% heads), the cumulative percentage of tails after all 50 trials would have moved from 20% to 42%—even though more heads came up during the subsequent flips. Incidentally, a player who bet $1 on tails on each of the 40 trials, assuming that tails was “due,” would have ended up losing $2. The average converges toward the expected mean, but it does not correct itself.  This can be illustrated by comparing Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the percentage of heads and tails in numerous coin tossing trials, while Figure 2 shows the actual number of heads and tails. In Figure 1, it is clear that the ratio of heads to tails is converging to the average of 50% as the number of tosses increases. Figure 2, however, shows that the actual number of heads and tails is not converging.  In fact, as the number of tosses increases, the line depicting the balance of heads vs. tails drifts away from 0. In some cases, the line drifts up (more heads) and in some case it drifts down (more tails). Many people who gamble understand the idea that the average converges towards the mean (Figure 1), but mistakenly believe that the actual number of heads and tails also converges towards the mean. The thick line in both graphs represents an individual coin that started out with more heads than tails. Notice how even though its average converges towards 50% (Figure 1), the line depicting the balance of heads and tails continues to drift upwards away from the mean (Figure 2).​      ​  Figure 1. Percentage of heads and tails over an increasing number of coin tosses. The percentage of heads and tails converges towards the mean.      ​  Figure 2. The balance of heads and tails over an increasing number of coin tosses. The actual number of heads and tails does not converge towards the mean; rather, it diverges away from the mean.   ​​​​​​                    Subscribe to our mailing list:  Subscribe    PGIO LinkedIn page  PGIO Twitter page  PGIO Facebook page        Privacy Policy   Handbooks & Pamphlets      Terms of Use   Newsletter      Contact   Blog          Disclaimer: Information on this site is not to be used for diagnosis, treatment or referral services and CAMH does not provide diagnostic, treatment or referral services through the Internet.

Probabilities always range between 0 and 1. The odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur.  If the probability of an event occurring is Y, then the probability of the event not occurring is 1-Y. (Example: If the probability of an event is 0.80 (80%), then the probability that the event will not occur is 1-0.80 = 0.20, or 20%.  The odds of an event represent the ratio of the (probability that the event will occur) / (probability that the event will not occur). This could be expressed as follows:  Odds of event = Y / (1-Y)  So, in this example, if the probability of the event occurring = 0.80, then the odds are 0.80 / (1-0.80) = 0.80/0.20 = 4 (i.e., 4 to 1).   If a race horse runs 100 races and wins 25 times and loses the other 75 times, the probability of winning is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%, but the odds of the horse winning are 25/75 = 0.333 or 1 win to 3 loses.  If the horse runs 100 races and wins 5 and loses the other 95 times, the probability of winning is 0.05 or 5%, and the odds of the horse winning are 5/95 = 0.0526.  If the horse runs 100 races and wins 50, the probability of winning is 50/100 = 0.50 or 50%, and the odds of winning are 50/50 = 1 (even odds).  If the horse runs 100 races and wins 80, the probability of winning is 80/100 = 0.80 or 80%, and the odds of winning are 80/20 = 4 to 1.   NOTE that when the probability is low, the odds and the probability are very similar.  With the case-control design we cannot compute the probability of disease in each of the exposure groups; therefore, we cannot compute the relative risk. However, we can compute the odds of disease in each of the exposure groups, and we can compare these by computing the odds ratio. In the hypothetical pesticide study the odds ratio is  OR= (7/10) / (5/57) = 6.65  Notice that this odds ratio is very close to the RR that would have been obtained if the entire source population had been analyzed. The explanation for this is that if the outcome being studied is fairly uncommon, then the odds of disease in an exposure group will be similar to the probability of disease in the exposure group. Consequently, the odds ratio provides a relative measure of effect for case-control studies, and it provides an estimate of the risk ratio in the source population, provided that the outcome of interest is uncommon.  We emphasized that in case-control studies the only measure of association that can be calculated is the odds ratio. However, in cohort-type studies, which are defined by following exposure groups to compare the incidence of an outcome, one can calculate both a risk ratio and an odds ratio.  If we arbitrarily label the cells in a contingency table as follows:         Diseased    Non-diseased          Exposed    a    b          Non-exposed    c    d         then the odds ratio is computed by taking the ratio of odds, where the odds in each group is computed as follows:  OR = (a/b) / (c/d)  As with a risk ratio, the convention is to place the odds in the unexposed group in the denominator. In addition, like a risk ratio, odds ratios do not follow a normal distribution, so we use the lo g transformation to promote normality. As a result, the procedure for computing a confidence interval for an odds ratio is a two step procedure in which we first generate a confidence interval for Ln(OR) and then take the antilog of the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval for Ln(OR) to determine the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval for the OR. The two steps are detailed below.  Computing the Confidence Interval for an Odds Ratio  To compute the confidence interval for an odds ratio use the formula    Compute the confidence interval for Ln(OR) using the equation above.  Compute the confidence interval for OR by finding the antilog of the result in step 1, i.e., exp(Lower Limit), exp (Upper Limit).   The null, or no difference, value of the confidence interval for the odds ratio is one. If a 95% CI for the odds ratio does not include one, then the odds are said to be statistically significantly different. We again reconsider the previous examples and produce estimates of odds ratios and compare these to our estimates of risk differences and relative risks.    Example:  Consider again the hypothetical pilot study on pesticide exposure and breast cancer:         Diseased    Non-diseased          Pesticide Exposure    7    10          Non-exposed    6    57         We noted above that  OR= (7/10) / (5/57) = 6.6  We can compute a 95% confidence interval for this odds ratio as follows:   Substituting we get the following:   This gives the following interval (0.61, 3.18), but this still need to be transformed by finding their antilog (1.85-23.94) to obtain the 95% confidence interval.  Interpretation: The odds of breast cancer in women with high DDT exposure are 6.65 times greater than the odds of breast cancer in women without high DDT exposure. We are 95% confident that the true odds ratio is between 1.85 and 23.94. The null value is 1, and because this confidence interval does not include 1, the result indicates a statistically significant difference in the odds of breast cancer women with versus low DDT exposure.  Note that an odds ratio is a good estimate of the risk ratio when the outcome occurs relatively infrequently (<10%). Therefore, odds ratios are generally interpreted as if they were risk ratios.  Note also that, while this result is considered statistically significant, the confidence interval is very broad, because the sample size is small. As a result, the point estimate is imprecise. Notice also that the confidence interval is asymmetric, i.e., the point estimate of OR=6.65 does not lie in the exact center of the confidence interval. Remember that we used a log transformation to compute the confidence interval, because the odds ratio is not normally distributed. Therefore, the confidence interval is asymmetric, because we used the log transformation to compute Ln(OR) and then took the antilog to compute the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval for the odds ratio.  Remember that in a true case-control study one can calculate an odds ratio, but not a risk ratio. However, one can calculate a risk difference (RD), a risk ratio (RR), or an odds ratio (OR) in cohort studies and randomized clinical trials. Consider again the data in the table below from the randomized trial assessing the effectiveness of a newly developed pain reliever as compared to the standard of care. Remember that a previous quiz question in this module asked you to calculate a point estimate for the difference in proportions of patients reporting a clinically meaningful reduction in pain between pain relievers as (0.46-0.22) = 0.24, or 24%, and the 95% confidence interval for the risk difference was (6%, 42%). Because the 95% confidence interval for the risk difference did not contain zero (the null value), we concluded that there was a statistically significant difference between pain relievers. Using the same data, we then generated a point estimate for the risk ratio and found RR= 0.46/0.22 = 2.09 and a 95% confidence interval of (1.14, 3.82). Because this confidence interval did not include 1, we concluded once again that this difference was statistically significant. We will now use these data to generate a point estimate and 95% confidence interval estimate for the odds ratio.   We now ask you to use these data to compute the odds of pain relief in each group, the odds ratio for patients receiving new pain reliever as compared to patients receiving standard pain reliever, and the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio.       Treatment Group      n    # with Reduction  of 3+ Points    Proportion with Reduction  of 3+ Points      New Pain Reliever    50    23    0.46      Standard Pain Reliever    50    11    0.22     Answer      When the study design allows for the calculation of a relative risk, it is the preferred measure as it is far more interpretable than an odds ratio. The odds ratio is extremely important, however, as it is the only measure of effect that can be computed in a case-control study design. When the outcome of interest is relatively rare (<10%), then the odds ratio and relative risk will be very close in magnitude. In such a case, investigators often interpret the odds ratio as if it were a relative risk (i.e., as a comparison of risks rather than a comparison of odds which is less intuitive).       return to top | previous page | next page     Content ©2017.

                Versus Probability.  What's The Difference?        If
                you are interested in learning how to win at gambling, you need
                to become familiar with the concepts of "odds" and 
                "probabilities."       These
                terms can be expressed as ratios, percentages or fractions and
                each has a slightly different meaning.  Just in case you slept though your course Statistics 101,
                or even managed to escape the experience altogether, I am going
                to attempt to clear things up.       Probability       A
                general definition of probability is "the likelihood that a
                given event will occur." When we apply this concept to
                gambling, we usually end up with a specific expression like 1
                out of 2 or 1:2.       When
                probability is expressed as two numbers, the first number
                represents the expected frequency of a specific event occurring.  The second number is the total number of  possible
                events or outcomes, including the specific event and all other
                events that can occur.      Let's
                take a look at the concept of probability applied to coin flips.  Consider this question - "What is the probability of
                a head showing on the next coin flip?"      Since
                there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and we are
                looking for only one event (heads), this probability can be
                expressed as 1 out of 2, 1 to 2 or 1:2 or even 1/2.       This
                two number expression can also be converted to a percentage by
                dividing the first number by the second number, which, in this
                case, will give us: 1 divided by 2 equals 0.50, which can also
                be expressed as 50%.    Therefore,
                the probability of getting heads on the next coin flip is 1 to 2
                or 50%.      Let's
                apply this concept to the game of roulette .  The American version of the game has the numbers 1 to 36,
                plus a zero and a double-zero, for a total of 38 numbers.  This gives us 38 possible outcomes on any spin of the
                wheel.  If your
                favorite number is 17, and you wanted to know how likely this
                was to show on the next spin of the wheel, you could express
                this as 1 out of 38, 1 to 38, 1:38 or 1/38.       To
                determine this probability as a percentage means - 1 divided by
                38 equals 0.026, which is 2.6% as a percentage.      Interpretation?  There is a 2.6% probability or chance of your wager on
                the number 17 winning on the next spin of the roulette wheel.       Odds      The
                definition of odds is the "likelihood (or probability) of a
                given event occurring, compared to the likelihood of that same
                event not occurring."      Odds,
                like probabilities, can be expressed as two numbers in the form
                of a ratio. The first number represents the expected frequency
                of a specific outcome occurring, which is the same as with
                probabilities.  However,
                unlike probabilities, the second number states only the number
                of  all the "other possible outcomes."      This
                figure excludes the specific event - that is, the first amount.      Going
                back to our coin toss, we can ask "What are the odds of a
                head showing on the next coin flip?"       If
                we decide to pick "heads" as our bet selection, we
                know that on a two-sided coin heads can only show one way.  The only other option is a tails.  We can show the odds of a heads showing on the next
                coin flip as 1 to 1, 1:1 or 1/1.      Unlike
                probabilities, which can also be expressed as percentages, odds
                are always shown as ratios.      Now,
                let's calculate the odds of number 17 showing up on an American
                roulette wheel, with 38 numbers. Our number 17 represents just
                one number.  The
                remaining numbers, excluding the number we chose, are 37, making
                the second figure in the ratio thirty-seven.  The odds of a 17 showing on the next spin, or any other
                single number showing on the next spin of the wheel, is
                expressed as 1 to 37, 1:37 or 1/37.      If
                we reverse this ratio, we will show odds against a 17 showing.  The odds against a 17 showing on the next spin of the
                roulette wheel are 37 to 1 or 37:1.          The
                House Edge in Roulette      The
                house gains its edge over the player because of the appearance
                of a zero and a double-zero on American roulette wheels.   European wheels have only one zero, giving the
                player a better chance of winning.      Let's
                calculate how the casino's edge affects the payoff of a wager on
                our favorite number, seventeen.       We
                have already calculated the probability of the number showing,
                which is 1 out of 38 or 1 to 38.      If
                the house did not have an edge over the player, the correct
                payout for winning the wager would be the real odds against
                winning the bet, which is 37 to 1.  However, the house gains an edge by shortchanging the
                player on the payoff of a winning bet and only pays the wager at
                35 to 1.     The
                house keeps 2 out of the 38 numbers for itself.  These numbers are the zero and double-zero.    The
                house edge over our bet on the number 17 can be calculated as
                follows:      Wheel
                with zero and double-zero - 2/38 = 0.0526 or 5.26%      Wheel
                with one-zero - 1/37 = 0.027 or 2.70%      Some
                casinos use a special rule for roulette's outside bets which
                allows the wager to stay up for an additional spin after a zero
                appears.  In this
                case the bet is said to be imprisoned.  This rule lowers the house edge even more.    The
                Gambler's Fallacy       Many
                gamblers place wagers based on a poor grasp of the law of
                averages.  They
                believe that because an event has not occurred for a while that
                it is due.       In
                one incident, when I first started playing roulette, I came up
                to a table and starting watching before I began wagering.  One man was wagering on red, which showed three times in
                a row while I was watching.  I exchanged my cash for
                chips and starting betting black since I knew that long streaks
                of a single repeating number are fairly rare.  I wagered $5 on black, feeling somewhat superior to the
                man who keep wagering on red.  Red showed again.  Next
                spin I wagered $10 on black, feeling more confident that black
                was "due" to show.  The ball landed on red again.      I
                continued to double my wagers until I had lost six bets in a
                row.  At this point
                I backed off and watched as red showed on eleven consecutive
                spins.       If
                I had not backed off wagering I would have run into the house
                betting limit before I eventually won a bet.      There
                are a couple of lessons to be learned here.  First, no number or event is ever due in a game of
                chance.  This
                includes all wagers in the games of roulette, craps and
                baccarat.  However,
                in general, bucking the trend is not a good idea.  The trend is your friend in roulette just like it is when
                playing the stock market.      The
                second lesson is that it often pays to be flexible in selecting
                your wagers in roulette.  Gambling
                probability is defined as the "likelihood" of an event
                occurring.  It does not mean "definite" and it certainly
                doesn't mean that the event will happen on the next spin or even
                the next two or three spins.          A
                Breakthrough New Roulette Strategy    Just
                recently I finished working on a year-long project that resulted
                in developing a amazing new roulette strategy that one of the
                testers even called "infallible."      Let
                me tell you a little more about this system.  Subjected to the most rigorous testing, it has been
                proven to -        Win
                    $147 an hour making $5 minimum bets in any land-based
                    casino.  These
                    results were obtained with fairly slow play on double-zero
                    wheels.        Generate
                    net profits of $735 an hour in online casinos.   With over 1,800 of these casinos to choose
                    from, this offers incredible profit potential.       Win
                    at a documented 97.75% rate.       Consistently deliver these
                    results without ever resorting to making higher wagers.     Incredibly,
                this strategy performs so well, that it really develops an edge
                over the game of roulette -even against the higher house edge
                double-zero games.  Recognizing
                its superior winning strengths, it was aptly named the
                "Maximum Advantage Roulette Strategy."      This
                system only requires making one bet at a time and wins a
                documented 97.75% of the games played.      And,
                because of the low level of wagers used, you can get started
                with this strategy as a $5 better (recommended) with a measly
                $100 investment (I suggest that you use $150 because I am very
                conservat ive).  I
                highly recommend that you "risk" five minutes of your
                time and read more about this proven performer here.

This article explains how to convert both Decimal and American eSports odds to their implied probability.   What is implied probability?   Implied probability is a vital concept for eSports bettors whether you are looking to bet on individual matches, futures, propositions, or live betting markets.  The implied probability is a conversion of odds into a percentage - whilst taking into account the bookmakers edge - and then eliminates the bookmakers edge to express the true odds of an event occurring.  In eSports betting, the bookmakers edge means the implied probability of an event will always add up to over 100%. The amount over 100% is the bookmakers’ margin. To understand how bookmakers work and to calculate their margin , watch the video below:    Why calculate implied probabilities?   Knowing how to convert betting odds into implied probabilities is vital for all bettors as it helps them assess the potential value on a particular eSports betting market. Once converted, if the implied probability is less than a bettor’s assessment, then it represents value.  For the purpose of this article we will use the odds for the Dota 2 match between Digital Chaos and Virtus.pro.      Implied probabiity odds example        Team Decimal Odds American Odds Implied Probability   Digital Chaos  4.810  +381  20.79%    Virtus.pro  1.192  -520  83.89%          Converting Decimal odds   The calculation for Decimal odds couldn’t be simpler. To calculate the implied probability for Digital Chaos to win follow these 2 stages:  Stage 1: 1 / 4.810  Stage 2: 0.207 x 100  Implied probability: 20.79%  Therefore the odds suggest Digital Chaos has a 20.79% chance of beating Virtus Pro.   Converting American odds   When converting American odds, we have to distinguish between plus and minus numbers.   Calculation for American minus numbers   To calculate the implied probability of Virtus.pro at -520 use these three steps:  Stage 1: (- (-520) / ((- (-520)) + 100)  Stage 2: 520 / (520 + 100)  Stage 3: 0.839 x 100  Implied probability : 83.89%  Therefore the odds suggest Virtus.pro has an 83.89 % chance of winning.  Calculation for American plus numbers  To calculate the implied probability of Digital Chaos at +381 use these three steps:  Stage 1: 100 / (381 + 100)  Stage 2: 100 / 481  Stage 3: 0.207  Implied probability : 20.79%  Therefore the odds suggest Digital Chaos has a 20.79% chance of beating Virtus Pro, which as always, is the same as the decimal odds conversion.  Now you know how to how to convert odds to their implied probability you’re in a better position to find value on your eSports bets.       eSports Home     See the latest eSports odds    Category   Educational     Tags   Explainer    Odds formats    Educational    eSports    CSGO    Dota 2    League of Legends     Share this article on     Facebook     Twitter      Google+    Embed      Embed      Embed code  Affiliate embed     Copy this code to embed the article on your site:    Copy embed code  Embed code copied to clipboard      1.

This calculator will convert "odds for winning" an event or "odds against winning" an event into percentage chances of both winning and losing.  Be careful if you are using sports teams odds or betting odds. If you see that the Patriots	super bowl odds are 9/2, that is most likely "odds against" and should be entered in the calculator with "Odds are: against winning."  When playing a lottery or other games of chance be sure you understand the odds or probability that is reported by the game organizer. A 1 in 500 chance of winning, or probability of winning, is entered into this calculator as "1 to 500 Odds are for winning". You may also see odds reported simply as chance of winning as 500:1. This most likely means "500 to 1 Odds are against winning" which is exactly the same as "1 to 500 Odds are for winning."  Probability Formulas:  This calculator will convert "odds of winning" for an event into a probability percentage chance of success.  Odds, are given as (chances for success) : (chances against success) or vice versa.  If odds are stated as an A to B chance of winning then the probability of winning is given as P W = A / (A + B) while the probability of losing is given as P L = B / (A + B).  For example, you win a game if you pull an ace out of a full deck of 52 cards. Pulling any other card you lose. The chance of winning is 4 out of 52, while the chance against winning is 48 out of 52 (52-4=48). Entering A=4 and B=48 into the calculator as 4:48 odds are for winning you get  For 4 to 48 odds for winning;  Probability of: Winning = (0.0769) or 7.6923% Losing = (0.9231) or 92.3077%  "Odds for" winning: 1:12 (reduced from 4:48) "Odds against" winning: 12:1 (reduced from 48:4)  Further Reading  Probability vs. Odds                                          Cite this content, page or calculator as:  Furey, Edward " Odds Probability Calculator "; from https://www.calculatorsoup.com - Online Calculator Resource.

With that said, it becomes obvious that one type of odds can be converted into another. Although it requires seemingly complicated calculations, these are easier to understand once you get a grip on these three types of odds. There are many tools available to make these conversions, and many online betting websites offer an option to display the odds in the preferred format. If one wants to work it out by themselves, they could refer to the table below:   Converting Odds to Implied Probabilities  Here comes the more interesting part: converting the aforementioned odds to their implied probabilities. Due to the significance of this part, we will not discuss the specific formula related to each type of odds. Rather, let's remember the general rule for the conversion of (any type of) odd into an implied probability.  Rule: Implied probability of an outcome = Stake / total payout  As shown, divide the amount wagered (on stake) by the total payout to get the implied probability of an outcome. If the odds mentioned in the earlier examples (covered in the previous reading) are converted into percentages or implied probabilities, we get the following results:  According to a bookmaker, the implied probability for:  Man City (odds: 8/13) to win against Crystal Palace on April 07, 2015, is 61.9% [{13/(8+13)}*100].  Hillary Clinton (odds: 2.20) to win the 2016 US Presidential elections is 45.45% [(1/2.2)*100].  Australia (odds: -250) to win the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup is 71.43% [{250/(100+250)}*100].  Remember, the odds keep changing as the bets come in, which means bookmakers’ probability estimations vary with time. Moreover, the odds displayed by different bookmakers can vary significantly, meaning that the odds displayed by a bookmaker are not always correct. Note that it's not only important to back winners, but one must do so when the odds accurately reflect the chance of winning. It is relatively easy to say that Man City will win against Crystal Palace, but would you be willing to risk $100 to make a profit of $61.53?  The key is to consider a betting opportunity valuable when the probability assessed for an outcome is higher than the implied probability estimated by the bookmaker.  (For related reading, refer to Are You Investing or Gambling? ).  Why Does The House Always Win?  Basically, the odds on display never reflect the true probability/chance of an event occurring (or not occurring). There is always a profit margin added by the bookmaker in these odds, which means that the payout to the successful punter is always less than what they should have received if the odds had reflected the true chances. This means that the bookmaker needs to estimate the true probability/chance of an outcome correctly in order to set the odds on display in such a way that it profits the bookmaker irrespective of an event outcome.  To support this statement, let’s look at the implied probabilities for each outcome of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup example we had discussed in the first reading on this topic.  Australia: -250 (implied probability = 71.43%)  New Zealand: +200 (implied probability = 33.33%)  If you notice, the total of these probabilities is 104.76% (71.43% + 33.33%). Doesn't that conflict with the fact that the sum of all probabilities must equal 100%? This is because the odds on display are not fair odds.  The percentage above 100% (i.e. 4.76%) represents the bookmaker’s over-round — the bookmaker’s potential profit if the bookie accepts the bets in the right proportion. If you bet on both the teams, you are actually risking $104.46 to get $100 back. From the bookie’s perspective, they are taking in $104.60 and expect to pay out $100 (including the stake), giving them an expected profit of 4.5% (=4.76/104.76), no matter which team wins. The bookie has a built-in edge here.  According to a study published in the Journal of Gambling Studies , the more hands a player wins, the less money they are likely to collect, especially with respect to novice players. According to the research, multiple wins are likely to yield small stakes, for which you need to play more, and the more you play the more likely you will eventually bear the brunt of occasional substantial losses. Here, behavioral economics comes into play. A player continues playing the lottery either in hopes of a big gain that would eventually offset the losses or the winning streak compels him/her to keep playing. In both cases, it is not rational or statistical reasoning but the person's emotions and the high of a win that lead them to play further. (For related reading, refer to The Worst Bets You Can Make at the Casino ).  Consider a casino. Everything — including the game rules, music, controlled lighting effects, alcoholic beverages, the interior decor— is carefully planned and designed to the house's advantage. The house wants you to stay and continue playing. All the games offered by the casino have a built-in house edge, although the house advantage varies with the game. Moreover, novices find it particularly difficult to do cognitive accounting and misjudge the variance of payouts when they have a streak of wins, ignoring the fact that frequent modest gains are eventually overweighed by infrequent significant losses. (For related reading, refer to Investing vs. Gambling: Where Is Your Money Safer? ).  The Bottom Line  A betting opportunity should be considered valuable if the probability assessed for an outcome is higher than the implied probability estimated by the bookmaker. Furthermore, the odds on display never reflect the true probability of an event occurring (or not). The payoff on a win is always less than what one should have received if the odds had reflected the true chances. This is because the bookmaker’s profit margin is included in the odds, which is why the house always wins.

Implied Probability is also useful when evaluating a bet or checking how likely an outcome is.   Fractions Used primarily in the UK and Ireland, fractions quote the potential profit should the bet succeed, relative to the stake. 
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 2/1 the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 2) and the total returned is £15 (£10 plus the £5 stake).  Decimals Decimals quote the potential return should the bet succeed, relative to the stake.
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 3 the total returned is £15 (£5 * 3) the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 3 minus the £5 stake).  American   Positive figures: The odds state the winnings on a £100 bet e.g. american odds of 110 would win £110 on a £100 bet.  Negative figures: The odds state how much must be bet to win £100 profit e.g. american odds of -90 would win £100 on a £90 bet.    Implied Probability Odds correlate to probability e.g a 3/1 bet is expected to win one in every 4 attempts, hence the probability is 25%.    Also See   Betting Calculator -

Odds Is Related to Probability    The formal way to describe the odds is as the probability of the event divided by the probability of the non-event . So odds are the ratio of two fractions :  the number of events divided by the number of subjects ( the probability of the event ) and  that fraction divided by the number of non-events divided by the number of subjects ( the probability of the non-event ).  So the formula for odds is p / (1 - p).  Since both fractions have the number of subjects in the denominator,  they reduce to our first presentation of odds as the number of events divided by the number of non-events.   Probability and Odds   If event occurs 1 of 5 times, probability = 0.2    Probability = 1/5 = 0.2   Out of 5 times, 1 time will be the event and 4 times will be the non-event, odds = 0.25    Odds = 1/5 / 4/5 = 1/4 = 0.25  Calculating the odds without the number of subjects:  by the ratio of the number of events (1)  by the number of non-events (4)   odds = 1/4 = 0.25    Calculating Probability Given Odds   To calculate probability given the odds:    Probability = odds/1+ odds To go in the other direction from odds to probability:  Divide the odds by 1 + odds.  In this example, (1/4) / (1+1/4) =  (1/4) / (5/4) =  1/5, the probability    Odds versus Probability   Odds is less intuitive than probability (probably wouldn't say "my odds of dying are 1/4")   No less legitimate mathematically, just not so easily understood   Also important because the log odds of the outcome is given by the coefficient of a predictor in a logistic regression   In multivariate analysis of a dichotomous outcome logistic regression is used and the coefficients, the betas, from a logistic regression give the odds ratio by raising e to the beta (exponentiating it on the natural logarithm scale).

(January 2011)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In poker , pot odds are the ratio of the current size of the pot to the cost of a contemplated call . [1] Pot odds are often compared to the probability of winning a hand with a future card in order to estimate the call's expected value .

The ratio has two numbers: the size of the pot and the cost of the call. To convert this ratio to the equivalent percentage, we add these two numbers together and then divide the cost of the call by this sum. For example, the pot is $30, and the cost of the call is $10. The pot odds in this situation are 30:10, or 3:1 when simplified. To get the percentage, we add 30 and 10 to get a sum of 40 and then divide 10 by 40, giving us 0.25, or 25%.  To convert any percentage or fraction to the equivalent odds, we subtract the numerator from the denominator and then divide this difference by the numerator. For example, to convert 25%, or 1/4, we subtract 1 from 4 to get 3 (or 25 from 100 to get 75) and then divide 3 by 1 (or 75 by 25), giving us 3, or 3:1.  Requires revision: Converting a fraction or percentage to equivalent odds is much simpler than the above stated process. In other words, 25% as a ratio is 1:4, not 3:1 which is 300%.  See also: Fractional odds  Using pot odds to determine expected value [ edit ]  When a player holds a drawing hand (a hand that is behind now but is likely to win if a certain card is drawn) pot odds are used to determine the expected value of that hand when the player is faced with a bet.  The expected value of a call is determined by comparing the pot odds to the odds of drawing a card that wins the pot. When the odds of drawing a card that wins the pot are numerically higher than the pot odds, the call has a positive expectation; on average, you win a portion of the pot that is greater than the cost of the call. Conversely, if the odds of drawing a winning card are numerically lower than the pot odds, the call has a negative expectation, and you can expect to win less money on average than it costs to call the bet.  Implied pot odds [ edit ]  Implied pot odds , or simply implied odds , are calculated the same way as pot odds, but take into consideration estimated future betting. Implied odds are calculated in situations where the player expects to fold in the following round if the draw is missed, thereby losing no additional bets, but expects to gain additional bets when the draw is made. Since the player expects to always gain additional bets in later rounds when the draw is made, and never lose any additional bets when the draw is missed, the extra bets that the player expects to gain, excluding his own, can fairly be added to the current size of the pot. This adjusted pot value is known as the implied pot.  Example (Texas Hold'em) [ edit ]  On the turn, Alice's hand is certainly behind, and she faces a $1 call to win a $10 pot against a single opponent. There are four cards remaining in the deck that make her hand a certain winner. Her probability of drawing one of those cards is therefore 4/47 (8.5%), which when converted to odds is 10.75:1. Since the pot lays 10:1 (9.1%), Alice will on average lose money by calling if there is no future betting. However, Alice expects her opponent to call her additional $1 bet on the final betting round if she makes her draw. Alice will fold if she misses her draw and thus lose no additional bets. Alice's implied pot is therefore $11 ($10 plus the expected $1 call to her additional $1 bet), so her implied pot odds are 11:1 (8.3%). Her call now has a positive expectation.  Reverse implied pot odds [ edit ]  Reverse implied pot odds , or simply reverse implied odds , apply to situations where a player will win the minimum if holding the best hand but lose the maximum if not having the best hand. Aggressive actions (bets and raises) are subject to reverse implied odds, because they win the minimum if they win immediately (the current pot), but may lose the maximum if called (the current pot plus the called bet or raise). These situations may also occur when a player has a made hand with little chance of improving what is believed to be currently the best hand, but an opponent continues to bet. An opponent with a weak hand will be likely to give up after the player calls and not call any bets the player makes. An opponent with a superior hand, will, on the other hand, continue, (extracting additional bets or calls from the player).  Limit Texas hold'em example [ edit ]  With one card to come, Alice holds a made hand with little chance of improving and faces a $10 call to win a $30 pot. If her opponent has a weak hand or is bluffing, Alice expects no further bets or calls from her opponent. If her opponent has a superior hand, Alice expects the opponent to bet another $10 on the end. Therefore, if Alice wins, she only expects to win the $30 currently in the pot, but if she loses, she expects to lose $20 ($10 call on the turn plus $10 call on the river). Because she is risking $20 to win $30, Alice's reverse implied pot odds are 1.5-to-1 ($30/$20) or 40 percent (1/(1.5+1)). For calling to have a positive expectation, Alice must believe the probability of her opponent having a weak hand is over 40 percent.  Manipulating pot odds [ edit ]  Often a player will bet to manipulate the pot odds offered to other players. A common example of manipulating pot odds is make a bet to protect a made hand that discourages opponents from chasing a drawing hand .  No-limit Texas hold 'em example [ edit ]  With one card to come, Bob has a made hand, but the board shows a potential flush draw. Bob wants to bet enough to make it wrong for an opponent with a flush draw to call, but Bob does not want to bet more than he has to in the event the opponent already has him beat. How much should Bob bet?  Assume a $20 pot and one opponent. If Bob bets $10 (half the pot), when his opponent acts, the pot will be $30 and it will cost $10 to call. The opponent's pot odds will be 3-to-1, or 25 percent. If the opponent is on a flush draw (9/46, approximately 19.565 percent or 4.11-to-1 odds against with one card to come), the pot is not offering adequate pot odds for the opponent to call unless the opponent thinks he can induce additional final round betting from Bob if the opponent completes his flush draw (see implied pot odds).  A bet of $6.43, resulting in pot odds of 4.11-to-1, would make his opponent mathematically indifferent to calling if implied odds are disregarded.  Bluffing frequency [ edit ]  Further information: Bluff (poker)  According to David Sklansky , game theory shows that a player should bluff a percentage of the time equal to his opponent's pot odds to call the bluff. For example, in the final betting round, if the pot is $30 and a player is contemplating a $30 bet (which will give his opponent 2-to-1 pot odds for the call), the player should bluff half as often as he would bet for value (one out of three times).  However, this conclusion does not take into account some of the context of specific situations. A player's bluffing frequency often accounts for many different factors, particularly the tightness or looseness of their opponents. Bluffing against a tight player is more likely to induce a fold than bluffing against a loose player, who is more likely to call the bluff. Sklansky's strategy is an equilibrium strategy in the sense that it is optimal against someone playing an optimal strategy against it.

In most contexts, there is no particular reason to prefer one over the other. Most scientists tend to feel more comfortable thinking about probabilities than odds, but that is a matter of training and custom, not logic.  The distinction is simple:   The probability that an event will occur is the fraction of times you expect to see that event in many trials. Probabilities always range between 0 and 1.  The odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur.   A probability of 0 is the same as odds of 0. Probabilities between 0 and 0.5 equal odds less than 1.0. A probability of 0.5 is the same as odds of 1.0. Think of it this way: The probability of flipping a coin to heads is 50%. The odds are “fifty: fifty,” which equals 1.0.  As the probability goes up from 0.5 to 1.0, the odds increase from 1.0 to approach infinity. For example, if the probability is 0.75, then the odds are 75:25, three to one, or 3.0.  If the odds are high (million to one), the probability is almost 1.00. If the odds are tiny (one to a million), the probablility is tiny, almost zero.  Converting between odds and probability is straightforward:   To convert from a probability to odds, divide the probability by one minus that probability. So if the probability is 10% or 0.10 , then the odds are 0.1/0.9 or ‘1 to 9’ or 0.111.  To convert from odds to a probability, divide the odds by one plus the odds. So to convert odds of 1/9 to a probability, divide 1/9 by 10/9 to obtain the probability of 0.10.             Need to learn Prism 7?

They are often used interchangeably in causal conversation or even in published material . However, they are not mathematically equivalent because they are looking at likeliness in different contexts. In everyday conversation when numbers or values aren’t given, the two terms are synonymous . If an event has a high probability, then it has high odds for happening. The incorrect usage arises when a person ascribes a mathematical value to either the odds or probability they are discussing. Hopefully, if you aren’t quite sure what the exact mathematical difference is, this will clear it up for you.  Probability is defined as the fraction of desired outcomes in the context of every possible outcome with a value between 0 and 1, where 0 would be an impossible event and 1 would represent an inevitable event. Probabilities are usually given as percentages. [ie. 50% probability that a coin will land on HEADS.] Odds can have any value from zero to infinity and they represent a ratio of desired outcomes versus the field. Odds are a ratio, and can be given in two different ways: ‘odds in favor’ and ‘odds against’. ‘Odds in favor’ are odds describing the if an event will occur, while ‘odds against’ will describe if an event will not occur. If you are familiar with gambling, ‘odds against’ are what Vegas gives as odds. More on that later. For the coin flip odds in favor of a HEADS outcome is 1:1, not 50%.  Visual Math  Simple probability of event A occurring is mathematically defined as:  $latex P(A) = \frac{Number \ of \ Event \ A}{Total \ Number \ of \ Events}&s=2$  The best way to illustrate this is with the classic marbles-in-a-bag example. The graphic below depicts all the marbles in an opaque bag that one marble will be pulled out of. There are 6 blue, 3 red, 2 yellow, and 1 green for a total of 12 marbles in the bag.   The probability of pulling a red marble would be calculated by taking the total number of red marbles and dividing it by the total number of marbles.   OR  $latex P(RED) = \frac{3 \ RED \ marbles}{12 \ TOTAL \ marbles} = 25\%&s=2$.  Notice that the probability calculation includes the red marbles in the denominator of the calculation, because probability considers the context of the entire event space. Odds, on the other hand, are the ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes. The denominator contains ONLY the marbles that aren’t the favorable outcomes. Odds uses the contexts of good outcomes and bad outcomes. Written as fractions, these two values are completely different. Probability is 1/4 while odds in favor are 1/3. You can see how mistakenly interchanging the terms could give the wrong information. The ‘odds in favor’ of RED would be mathematically calculated by   OR  $latex Odds\_Favor(RED) = \frac{3 \ RED \ marbles}{9 \ NOT \ RED \ marbles} = 1:3&s=2$.  To find ‘odds against’ you would simply flip odds in favor upside down and this describes the odds of the event not occurring.   OR  $latex Odds\_Against(RED) = \frac{9 \ NOT \ RED \ marbles}{3 \ RED \ marbles} = 3:1&s=2$.  Gambling  ‘Odds against’ are commonly are used in the context of gambling. When you hear that the Seattle Seahawks Vegas odds to win the Super Bowl are 5:1 [Retrieved 9/19/2014], the 5:1 is referring to the ‘odds against’ Seattle winning the Super Bowl. Using some quick math we could determine the probability of Seattle winning the Super Bowl would be 1/6 or 16.7%.  Vegas odds are technically payoff odds, because they describe the payout if you were to win the bet. The payout on the Seahawks would win you $5 for every $1 bet on the Seattle winning the Super Bowl. They aren’t true odds, since no one is really sure what the true odds are, because you can’t simply count and weigh the possibilities like with the bag of marbles. The payoff will increase when the event becomes less likely. If you could create a reliable predictive model that told you the Seahawks actually had a 20% probability to win the Super Bowl, you could bet on the Seahawks, knowing that their actual probability to win is better than what Vegas is giving them. And if you made enough bets like this you could beat Vegas.  Mathematical Relationship  I stated earlier that probability and odds were colloquially interchangeable when values aren’t given. This is true, because the two are mathematically related. Odds can be computed from probability and probability from odds.  $latex P(A) = \frac{Odds\_Favor(A)}{1 + Odds\_Favor(A)}&s=2$  $latex Odds\_Favor(A) = \frac{P(A)}{1 – P(A)}&s=2$  Using the RED marble example [P(RED) = 1/4 and Odds_Favor(RED) = 1/3] we can demonstrate how these are equivalent:  $latex P(RED) = \frac{1/3}{1 + 1/3} = \frac{1/3}{4/3} = \frac{1}{4}&s=2$  $latex Odds\_Favor(RED) = \frac{1/4}{1 – 1/4} = \frac{1/4}{3/4} = \frac{1}{3}&s=2$   featured marbles odds odds against odds in favor probability stats   Post navigation   Previous Post MLB — Run Distribution Per Game & Per Inning — Negative Binomial Next Post Do MLB Playoff Odds Work?

How do bookmakers make money        How to calculate implied probability in betting     Learning how to calculate implied probability from betting odds is key to assessing the potential value in a betting market.  Implied probability is a conversion of betting odds into a percentage. It takes into account the bookmaker margin to express the expected probability of an outcome occurring.  Knowing how to convert betting odds into implied probabilities is fundamental for betting as it helps you assess the potential value on a particular market. Once converted, if the implied probability is less than your assessment, then it represents betting value .  The most common odds formats are decimal, American and fractional. The formulas below explain how to convert odds to implied probabilities.  For the examples below we will use Smarkets odds for the 2016 Australian Open final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic:     Player  Decimal odds  Fractional odds  American odds  Implied probability    Djokovic  1.20  1/5  - 500  83.3%    Murray  5.50  9/2  +450  18.1%     Converting decimal odds to implied probability  To calculate the implied probability from decimal odds the equation is:  (1/ decimal odds) * 100 = implied probability  So to find out the probability of a Murray win would be:  (1 / 5.50) * 100 = 18.1%  Therefore, according to the decimal odds of 5.50, Andy Murray had an 18.1% chance of winning.  Converting fractional odds to implied probability  To calculate the implied probability from fractional odds the equation is:  denominator / (denominator + numerator) * 100 = implied probability  Therefore to find out the probability of a Murray win would simply be:  2 / (2 + 9) * 100 = 18.1%  As you can see this is the same probability as with the decimal odds. Why? Because odds in any format are just a different display of the same chance.  Converting American odds to implied probability  There are two instances of American odds (positive and negative) which require separate calculations.  Converting negative American odds  The equation to convert negative American odds is:  Negative American odds / (Negative American odds + 100) * 100 = implied probability  To find out the probability of a Djokovic win:  500 / (500+100) * 100 = 83.3%  Converting positive American odds  The equation to convert positive American odds is:  100 / (positive American odds + 100) * 100 = implied probability  To calculate the probability of a Murray win would be:  100 / (450 + 100) * 100 = 18.1%  Apply this to betting  Now you understand how to calculate the implied probability behind the odds, you can identify potential value in a betting market. If the bookmaker/exchange implied probability is less than your own assessed probability, that outcome represents a value betting opportunity.

Implied Probability is also useful when evaluating a bet or checking how likely an outcome is.   Fractions Used primarily in the UK and Ireland, fractions quote the potential profit should the bet succeed, relative to the stake. 
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 2/1 the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 2) and the total returned is £15 (£10 plus the £5 stake).  Decimals Decimals quote the potential return should the bet succeed, relative to the stake.
For example if £5 is bet at odds of 3 the total returned is £15 (£5 * 3) the potential profit is £10 (£5 * 3 minus the £5 stake).  American   Positive figures: The odds state the winnings on a £100 bet e.g. american odds of 110 would win £110 on a £100 bet.  Negative figures: The odds state how much must be bet to win £100 profit e.g. american odds of -90 would win £100 on a £90 bet.    Implied Probability Odds correlate to probability e.g a 3/1 bet is expected to win one in every 4 attempts, hence the probability is 25%.    Also See   Betting Calculator -

Probability is an estimate of the relative average frequency with which an event occurs in repeated independent trials. The relative frequency is always between 0% (the event never occurs) and 100% (the event always occurs). Probability gives us a tool to predict how often an event will occur, but does not allow us to predict when exactly an event will occur. Probability can also be used to determine the conditions for obtaining certain results or the long-term financial prospects of a particular game; it may also help determine if a particular game is worth playing. It is often expressed as odds, a fraction or a decimal fraction (also known as a proportion). Probability and odds are slightly different ways of describing a player’s chances of winning a bet.   Note: This page is excerpted from Probability, Random Events, and the Mathematics of Gambling . References can be found on page 24 of the PDF available for download below.    Probability, Random Events, and the Mathematics of Gambling    Download PDF     Probability  Probability is an estimate of the chance of winning divided by the total number of chances available. Probability is an ordinary fraction (e.g., 1/4) that can also be expressed as a percentage (e.g., 25%) or as a proportion between 0 and 1 (e.g., p = 0.25). If there are four tickets in a draw and a player owns one of them, his or her probability of winning is 1 in 4 or 1/4 or 25% or p = 0.25.  Odds  Odds are ratios of a player’s chances of losing to his or her chances of winning, or the average frequency of a loss to the average frequency of a win. If a player owns 1 of 4 tickets, his/her probability is 1 in 4 but his/her odds are 3 to 1. That means that there are 3 chances of losing and only 1 chance of winning. To convert odds to probability, take the player’s chance of winning, use it as the numerator and divide by the total number of chances, both winning and losing. For example, if the odds are 4 to 1, the probability equals 1 / (1 + 4) = 1/5 or 20%. Odds of 1 to 1 (50%) are called “evens,” and a payout of 1 to 1 is called “even money.” Epidemiologists use odds ratios to describe the risk for contracting a disease (e.g., a particular group of people might be 2.5 times more likely to have cancer than the rest of the population).  In gambling, “odds” rarely mean the actual chance of a win. Most of the time, when the word “odds” is used, it refers to a subjective estimate of the odds rather than a precise mathematical computation. Furthermore, the odds posted by a racetrack or bookie will not be the “true odds,” but the payout odds. The true odds are the actual chances of winning, whereas the payout odds are the ratio of payout for each unit bet. A favourite horse might be quoted at odds of 2 to 1, which mathematically would represent a probability of 33.3%, but in this case the actual meaning is that the track estimates that it will pay $2 profit for every $1 bet. A long shot (a horse with a low probability of winning) might be quoted at 18 to 1 (a mathematical probability of 5.3%), but these odds do not reflect the probability that the horse will win, they mean only that the payout for a win will be $18 profit for every $1 bet. When a punter says “those are good odds,” he or she is essentially saying that the payout odds compensate for the true odds against a horse winning. The true odds of a horse are actually unknown, but most often the true odds against a horse winning are longer (a lower chance of a win) than the payout odds (e.g., payout odds = 3 to 1; true odds = 5 to 1).  The posted odds of a horse actually overestimate the horse’s chance of winning to ensure that the punter is underpaid for a win.  Equally Likely Outcomes  Central to probability is the idea of equally likely outcomes (Stewart, 1989). Each side of a die or coin is equally likely to come up. Probability, however, does not always seem to be about events that are equally likely. For example, the bar symbol on a slot machine might have a probability of 25%, while a double diamond might have a probability of 2%. This does not actually contradict the idea of equally likely outcomes. Instead, think of the 25% as 25 chances and the 2% as two chances, for a total of 27 chances out of 100. Each of those 27 chances is equally likely. As another example, in rolling two dice there are 36 possible outcomes: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1) . . . (6, 6); and each of these combinations is equally likely to happen. A player rolling 2 dice, however, is most likely to get a total of 7 because there are six ways to make a 7 from the two dice: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2) and (6, 1). A player is least likely to get a total of either 2 or 12 because there is only one way to make a 2 (1, 1) and one way to make a 12 (6, 6).  Independence of Events  A basic assumption in probability theory is that each event is independent of all other events. That is, previous draws have no influence on the next draw. A popular catch phrase is “the dice have no memory.” A die or roulette ball cannot look back and determine that it is due for a 6 or some other number. How could a coin decide to turn up a head after 20 tails? Each event is independent and therefore the player can never predict what will come up next. If a fair coin was flipped 5 times and came up heads 5 times in a row, the next flip could be either heads or tails. The fact that heads have come up 5 times in a row has no influence on the next flip. It is wise not to treat something that is very very unlikely as if it were impossible (see Turner, 1998). In fact, if a coin is truly random, it must be possible for heads to come up 1 million times in a row. Such an event is extraordinarily unlikely, p = 1/2 1,000,000 , but possible. Even then, the next flip is just as likely to be heads as it is tails. Nonetheless, many people believe that a coin corrects itself; if heads comes up too often, they think tails is due.  To complicate matters, however, there are cases where random events are not completely independent. With cards, the makeup of the deck is altered as cards are drawn from the deck. As a result, the value of subsequent cards is constrained by what has already been drawn. Nonetheless, each of the cards that remains in the deck is still equally probable. If, for example, there are only six cards left in a deck, four 7's and two 8's, a 7 is twice as likely to be drawn as an 8, but the specific card, the 7 of spades, has the same probability of being drawn as the 8 of diamonds.  Opportunities Abound  Another key aspect to computing probability is factoring in the number of opportunities for something to occur. The more opportunities there are, the more likely it is that an event will occur. The more tickets a player buys or the more often a player buys them, the greater the player’s chances of winning. At the same time, the more tickets purchased, the greater the average expected loss. One thousand tickets means 1,000 opportunities to win, so that the chance of winning Lotto 6/49 goes from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 14,000. However, because the expected return is nearly always negative, the player will still lose money, on average, no matter how many tickets the player purchases. This is true whether the player buys several tickets for the same draw or one ticket for every draw. Adding more opportunities (e.g., more tickets, bingo cards or slot machines) increases a player’s chance of a win, but does not allow him/her to beat the odds.  Combinations  One final aspect of probability is the fact that the likelihood of two events occurring in combination is always less than the probability of either event occurring by itself. Friday occurs, once every 7 days (1/7) and the 13th day of the month comes once per month (about 1/30 on average). Friday the 13th, however, only occurs roughly once in 210 days (7 x 30) or once or twice per year.  To compute the joint probability of an event, multiply the probability of each of the two events. For example, the chances of rolling a 4 with a single dice are 1/6, or 16.7%. The chances of rolling a 4 two times in a row are: 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 (2.78%). The chances of rolling a 4 three times in a row is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/216 (0.46%). It is important to note, however, that the joint probability of two events occurring refers only to events that have not happened yet. If something has already happened, then its chance of occurring is 100% because it has already happened. If the number 4 came up on the last two rolls, the chances of rolling another 4 are 1/6 not 1/216 because the new formula is 1 x 1 x 1/6, not 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6. Each event is an independent event. In addition, the chances of any number coming up twice in a row are 1/6, not 1/36. This is because there are six possible ways (opportunities) of getting the same number twice in a row: (1/6 x 1/6) x 6 = 6/36 = 1/6.  It is the cumulative and multiplicative aspects of probability that lead people to overestimate their chances of winning. People tend to underestimate the chance of getting one or two of the same symbols on a slot machine because they do not take into account the number of opportunities. A number of studies have shown that people can unconsciously learn probability through experience (Reber, 1993). Suppose the chances of getting a diamond on a slot machine are 1 in 32 on each of three reels. The chance of getting at least one diamond is 3 (the number of reels) x 1/32 = 9.4%. That is, the player will see a diamond on the payline roughly one time every 10.6 spins. But their chances of getting three diamonds would be 1/32 x 1/32 x 1/32 = 1/ 32,768 = 0.003%. Because we occasionally see one (9.4%) or two (0.3%) winning symbols on the payline, we may overestimate the chances of getting three of the big win symbols. This overestimation of the odds is also likely enhanced by seeing the big win symbols spin by on each spin, the occurrence of big win symbols above or below the payline, the distortion of the apparent odds caused by virtual reel mapping, and the larger number of big win symbols on the first two reels (see Turner & Horbay, 2004).  Law of Averages and the Law of Large Numbers  Part of the explanation for the persistent belief among those who gamble that there are patterns in chance, may stem from a misunderstanding of two related “laws” of statistics: the law of averages and the law of large numbers. The first is an informal folk theory of statistics; the second is a statistical law. These laws can be summarized as follows:   Law of Averages: Things average out over time.   Law of Large Numbers: As the sample size increases the average of the actual outcomes will more closely approximate the mathematical probability.  The law of large numbers is a useful way to understand betting outcomes. A coin on average will come up heads 50% of the time. It could nonetheless come up heads 100% of the time or 0% of the time. In a short trial, heads may easily come up on every flip. The larger the number of flips, however, the closer the percentage will be to 50%.  The law of averages is an informal approximation of the law of large numbers. The problem with the law of averages, as it is often understood, is that people assume that if something has not happened it is due to happen. For example, a person who gambles might expect that if heads have come up 10 times in a row, the next flip is more likely to be tails because the flips have to average out to 50%. Many people believe that deviations from chance are corrected by subsequent events and refer to the law of averages in support of their belief. Turner, Wiebe, Falkowski-Ham, Kelly and Skinner (2005) found that 36% of the general population believes that after 5 heads in a row the next flip is more likely to be tails. The law of large numbers, on the other hand, asserts only that the average converges towards the true mean as more observations are added. The average is not somehow corrected to ensure it reflects the expected average. The key difference is in the expectation. After a streak of 10 heads in a row, the law of averages would predict that more tails should come up so that the average is balanced out. The law of large numbers only predicts that after a sufficiently large number of trials, the streak of 10 heads in a row will be statistically irrelevant and the average will be close to the mathematical probability.  Some people accept the idea that the measured average will reflect the probability percentage in the long run, but still expect that if a trial of coin tosses began with a streak of heads, after a million flips extra tails would have to have occurred for the measured average to be close to 50%. One individual argued that there had to be a “bias” in favour of tails to get the average back to 50%. This is still incorrect. According to the law of large numbers, it is not the actual number of flips that converges to the probability percentage, but the average number of flips. Suppose we start by getting 10 heads in a row and keep flipping the coin 1 million times. Does the difference of 10 go away? No. In fact, after 1 million flips the number of heads and tails could differ by as much as 1 or 2 thousand. Even a difference of 9,000 more tails than heads would still round off to 50% after one million flips. Consequently, the individual cannot use deviations from the expected average to get an edge.  It is important to realize that this “law” is really only a statement that summarizes what has been observed, most of the time, over a large (in theory, infinite) number of events. It says absolutely nothing about what will happen next or is likely to happen. Suppose a coin was tossed and the first 10 coin tosses resulted in the following sequence of heads and tails: T, H, H, H, H, H, T, H, H, H (20% tails, 80% heads). If the next 40 trials resulted in 19 tails and 21 heads (47.5% tails and 52.5% heads), the cumulative percentage of tails after all 50 trials would have moved from 20% to 42%—even though more heads came up during the subsequent flips. Incidentally, a player who bet $1 on tails on each of the 40 trials, assuming that tails was “due,” would have ended up losing $2. The average converges toward the expected mean, but it does not correct itself.  This can be illustrated by comparing Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the percentage of heads and tails in numerous coin tossing trials, while Figure 2 shows the actual number of heads and tails. In Figure 1, it is clear that the ratio of heads to tails is converging to the average of 50% as the number of tosses increases. Figure 2, however, shows that the actual number of heads and tails is not converging.  In fact, as the number of tosses increases, the line depicting the balance of heads vs. tails drifts away from 0. In some cases, the line drifts up (more heads) and in some case it drifts down (more tails). Many people who gamble understand the idea that the average converges towards the mean (Figure 1), but mistakenly believe that the actual number of heads and tails also converges towards the mean. The thick line in both graphs represents an individual coin that started out with more heads than tails. Notice how even though its average converges towards 50% (Figure 1), the line depicting the balance of heads and tails continues to drift upwards away from the mean (Figure 2).​      ​  Figure 1. Percentage of heads and tails over an increasing number of coin tosses. The percentage of heads and tails converges towards the mean.      ​  Figure 2. The balance of heads and tails over an increasing number of coin tosses. The actual number of heads and tails does not converge towards the mean; rather, it diverges away from the mean.   ​​​​​​                    Subscribe to our mailing list:  Subscribe    PGIO LinkedIn page  PGIO Twitter page  PGIO Facebook page        Privacy Policy   Handbooks & Pamphlets      Terms of Use   Newsletter      Contact   Blog          Disclaimer: Information on this site is not to be used for diagnosis, treatment or referral services and CAMH does not provide diagnostic, treatment or referral services through the Internet.

Probabilities always range between 0 and 1. The odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur.  If the probability of an event occurring is Y, then the probability of the event not occurring is 1-Y. (Example: If the probability of an event is 0.80 (80%), then the probability that the event will not occur is 1-0.80 = 0.20, or 20%.  The odds of an event represent the ratio of the (probability that the event will occur) / (probability that the event will not occur). This could be expressed as follows:  Odds of event = Y / (1-Y)  So, in this example, if the probability of the event occurring = 0.80, then the odds are 0.80 / (1-0.80) = 0.80/0.20 = 4 (i.e., 4 to 1).   If a race horse runs 100 races and wins 25 times and loses the other 75 times, the probability of winning is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%, but the odds of the horse winning are 25/75 = 0.333 or 1 win to 3 loses.  If the horse runs 100 races and wins 5 and loses the other 95 times, the probability of winning is 0.05 or 5%, and the odds of the horse winning are 5/95 = 0.0526.  If the horse runs 100 races and wins 50, the probability of winning is 50/100 = 0.50 or 50%, and the odds of winning are 50/50 = 1 (even odds).  If the horse runs 100 races and wins 80, the probability of winning is 80/100 = 0.80 or 80%, and the odds of winning are 80/20 = 4 to 1.   NOTE that when the probability is low, the odds and the probability are very similar.  With the case-control design we cannot compute the probability of disease in each of the exposure groups; therefore, we cannot compute the relative risk. However, we can compute the odds of disease in each of the exposure groups, and we can compare these by computing the odds ratio. In the hypothetical pesticide study the odds ratio is  OR= (7/10) / (5/57) = 6.65  Notice that this odds ratio is very close to the RR that would have been obtained if the entire source population had been analyzed. The explanation for this is that if the outcome being studied is fairly uncommon, then the odds of disease in an exposure group will be similar to the probability of disease in the exposure group. Consequently, the odds ratio provides a relative measure of effect for case-control studies, and it provides an estimate of the risk ratio in the source population, provided that the outcome of interest is uncommon.  We emphasized that in case-control studies the only measure of association that can be calculated is the odds ratio. However, in cohort-type studies, which are defined by following exposure groups to compare the incidence of an outcome, one can calculate both a risk ratio and an odds ratio.  If we arbitrarily label the cells in a contingency table as follows:         Diseased    Non-diseased          Exposed    a    b          Non-exposed    c    d         then the odds ratio is computed by taking the ratio of odds, where the odds in each group is computed as follows:  OR = (a/b) / (c/d)  As with a risk ratio, the convention is to place the odds in the unexposed group in the denominator. In addition, like a risk ratio, odds ratios do not follow a normal distribution, so we use the lo g transformation to promote normality. As a result, the procedure for computing a confidence interval for an odds ratio is a two step procedure in which we first generate a confidence interval for Ln(OR) and then take the antilog of the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval for Ln(OR) to determine the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval for the OR. The two steps are detailed below.  Computing the Confidence Interval for an Odds Ratio  To compute the confidence interval for an odds ratio use the formula    Compute the confidence interval for Ln(OR) using the equation above.  Compute the confidence interval for OR by finding the antilog of the result in step 1, i.e., exp(Lower Limit), exp (Upper Limit).   The null, or no difference, value of the confidence interval for the odds ratio is one. If a 95% CI for the odds ratio does not include one, then the odds are said to be statistically significantly different. We again reconsider the previous examples and produce estimates of odds ratios and compare these to our estimates of risk differences and relative risks.    Example:  Consider again the hypothetical pilot study on pesticide exposure and breast cancer:         Diseased    Non-diseased          Pesticide Exposure    7    10          Non-exposed    6    57         We noted above that  OR= (7/10) / (5/57) = 6.6  We can compute a 95% confidence interval for this odds ratio as follows:   Substituting we get the following:   This gives the following interval (0.61, 3.18), but this still need to be transformed by finding their antilog (1.85-23.94) to obtain the 95% confidence interval.  Interpretation: The odds of breast cancer in women with high DDT exposure are 6.65 times greater than the odds of breast cancer in women without high DDT exposure. We are 95% confident that the true odds ratio is between 1.85 and 23.94. The null value is 1, and because this confidence interval does not include 1, the result indicates a statistically significant difference in the odds of breast cancer women with versus low DDT exposure.  Note that an odds ratio is a good estimate of the risk ratio when the outcome occurs relatively infrequently (<10%). Therefore, odds ratios are generally interpreted as if they were risk ratios.  Note also that, while this result is considered statistically significant, the confidence interval is very broad, because the sample size is small. As a result, the point estimate is imprecise. Notice also that the confidence interval is asymmetric, i.e., the point estimate of OR=6.65 does not lie in the exact center of the confidence interval. Remember that we used a log transformation to compute the confidence interval, because the odds ratio is not normally distributed. Therefore, the confidence interval is asymmetric, because we used the log transformation to compute Ln(OR) and then took the antilog to compute the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval for the odds ratio.  Remember that in a true case-control study one can calculate an odds ratio, but not a risk ratio. However, one can calculate a risk difference (RD), a risk ratio (RR), or an odds ratio (OR) in cohort studies and randomized clinical trials. Consider again the data in the table below from the randomized trial assessing the effectiveness of a newly developed pain reliever as compared to the standard of care. Remember that a previous quiz question in this module asked you to calculate a point estimate for the difference in proportions of patients reporting a clinically meaningful reduction in pain between pain relievers as (0.46-0.22) = 0.24, or 24%, and the 95% confidence interval for the risk difference was (6%, 42%). Because the 95% confidence interval for the risk difference did not contain zero (the null value), we concluded that there was a statistically significant difference between pain relievers. Using the same data, we then generated a point estimate for the risk ratio and found RR= 0.46/0.22 = 2.09 and a 95% confidence interval of (1.14, 3.82). Because this confidence interval did not include 1, we concluded once again that this difference was statistically significant. We will now use these data to generate a point estimate and 95% confidence interval estimate for the odds ratio.   We now ask you to use these data to compute the odds of pain relief in each group, the odds ratio for patients receiving new pain reliever as compared to patients receiving standard pain reliever, and the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio.       Treatment Group      n    # with Reduction  of 3+ Points    Proportion with Reduction  of 3+ Points      New Pain Reliever    50    23    0.46      Standard Pain Reliever    50    11    0.22     Answer      When the study design allows for the calculation of a relative risk, it is the preferred measure as it is far more interpretable than an odds ratio. The odds ratio is extremely important, however, as it is the only measure of effect that can be computed in a case-control study design. When the outcome of interest is relatively rare (<10%), then the odds ratio and relative risk will be very close in magnitude. In such a case, investigators often interpret the odds ratio as if it were a relative risk (i.e., as a comparison of risks rather than a comparison of odds which is less intuitive).       return to top | previous page | next page     Content ©2017.

                Versus Probability.  What's The Difference?        If
                you are interested in learning how to win at gambling, you need
                to become familiar with the concepts of "odds" and 
                "probabilities."       These
                terms can be expressed as ratios, percentages or fractions and
                each has a slightly different meaning.  Just in case you slept though your course Statistics 101,
                or even managed to escape the experience altogether, I am going
                to attempt to clear things up.       Probability       A
                general definition of probability is "the likelihood that a
                given event will occur." When we apply this concept to
                gambling, we usually end up with a specific expression like 1
                out of 2 or 1:2.       When
                probability is expressed as two numbers, the first number
                represents the expected frequency of a specific event occurring.  The second number is the total number of  possible
                events or outcomes, including the specific event and all other
                events that can occur.      Let's
                take a look at the concept of probability applied to coin flips.  Consider this question - "What is the probability of
                a head showing on the next coin flip?"      Since
                there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and we are
                looking for only one event (heads), this probability can be
                expressed as 1 out of 2, 1 to 2 or 1:2 or even 1/2.       This
                two number expression can also be converted to a percentage by
                dividing the first number by the second number, which, in this
                case, will give us: 1 divided by 2 equals 0.50, which can also
                be expressed as 50%.    Therefore,
                the probability of getting heads on the next coin flip is 1 to 2
                or 50%.      Let's
                apply this concept to the game of roulette .  The American version of the game has the numbers 1 to 36,
                plus a zero and a double-zero, for a total of 38 numbers.  This gives us 38 possible outcomes on any spin of the
                wheel.  If your
                favorite number is 17, and you wanted to know how likely this
                was to show on the next spin of the wheel, you could express
                this as 1 out of 38, 1 to 38, 1:38 or 1/38.       To
                determine this probability as a percentage means - 1 divided by
                38 equals 0.026, which is 2.6% as a percentage.      Interpretation?  There is a 2.6% probability or chance of your wager on
                the number 17 winning on the next spin of the roulette wheel.       Odds      The
                definition of odds is the "likelihood (or probability) of a
                given event occurring, compared to the likelihood of that same
                event not occurring."      Odds,
                like probabilities, can be expressed as two numbers in the form
                of a ratio. The first number represents the expected frequency
                of a specific outcome occurring, which is the same as with
                probabilities.  However,
                unlike probabilities, the second number states only the number
                of  all the "other possible outcomes."      This
                figure excludes the specific event - that is, the first amount.      Going
                back to our coin toss, we can ask "What are the odds of a
                head showing on the next coin flip?"       If
                we decide to pick "heads" as our bet selection, we
                know that on a two-sided coin heads can only show one way.  The only other option is a tails.  We can show the odds of a heads showing on the next
                coin flip as 1 to 1, 1:1 or 1/1.      Unlike
                probabilities, which can also be expressed as percentages, odds
                are always shown as ratios.      Now,
                let's calculate the odds of number 17 showing up on an American
                roulette wheel, with 38 numbers. Our number 17 represents just
                one number.  The
                remaining numbers, excluding the number we chose, are 37, making
                the second figure in the ratio thirty-seven.  The odds of a 17 showing on the next spin, or any other
                single number showing on the next spin of the wheel, is
                expressed as 1 to 37, 1:37 or 1/37.      If
                we reverse this ratio, we will show odds against a 17 showing.  The odds against a 17 showing on the next spin of the
                roulette wheel are 37 to 1 or 37:1.          The
                House Edge in Roulette      The
                house gains its edge over the player because of the appearance
                of a zero and a double-zero on American roulette wheels.   European wheels have only one zero, giving the
                player a better chance of winning.      Let's
                calculate how the casino's edge affects the payoff of a wager on
                our favorite number, seventeen.       We
                have already calculated the probability of the number showing,
                which is 1 out of 38 or 1 to 38.      If
                the house did not have an edge over the player, the correct
                payout for winning the wager would be the real odds against
                winning the bet, which is 37 to 1.  However, the house gains an edge by shortchanging the
                player on the payoff of a winning bet and only pays the wager at
                35 to 1.     The
                house keeps 2 out of the 38 numbers for itself.  These numbers are the zero and double-zero.    The
                house edge over our bet on the number 17 can be calculated as
                follows:      Wheel
                with zero and double-zero - 2/38 = 0.0526 or 5.26%      Wheel
                with one-zero - 1/37 = 0.027 or 2.70%      Some
                casinos use a special rule for roulette's outside bets which
                allows the wager to stay up for an additional spin after a zero
                appears.  In this
                case the bet is said to be imprisoned.  This rule lowers the house edge even more.    The
                Gambler's Fallacy       Many
                gamblers place wagers based on a poor grasp of the law of
                averages.  They
                believe that because an event has not occurred for a while that
                it is due.       In
                one incident, when I first started playing roulette, I came up
                to a table and starting watching before I began wagering.  One man was wagering on red, which showed three times in
                a row while I was watching.  I exchanged my cash for
                chips and starting betting black since I knew that long streaks
                of a single repeating number are fairly rare.  I wagered $5 on black, feeling somewhat superior to the
                man who keep wagering on red.  Red showed again.  Next
                spin I wagered $10 on black, feeling more confident that black
                was "due" to show.  The ball landed on red again.      I
                continued to double my wagers until I had lost six bets in a
                row.  At this point
                I backed off and watched as red showed on eleven consecutive
                spins.       If
                I had not backed off wagering I would have run into the house
                betting limit before I eventually won a bet.      There
                are a couple of lessons to be learned here.  First, no number or event is ever due in a game of
                chance.  This
                includes all wagers in the games of roulette, craps and
                baccarat.  However,
                in general, bucking the trend is not a good idea.  The trend is your friend in roulette just like it is when
                playing the stock market.      The
                second lesson is that it often pays to be flexible in selecting
                your wagers in roulette.  Gambling
                probability is defined as the "likelihood" of an event
                occurring.  It does not mean "definite" and it certainly
                doesn't mean that the event will happen on the next spin or even
                the next two or three spins.          A
                Breakthrough New Roulette Strategy    Just
                recently I finished working on a year-long project that resulted
                in developing a amazing new roulette strategy that one of the
                testers even called "infallible."      Let
                me tell you a little more about this system.  Subjected to the most rigorous testing, it has been
                proven to -        Win
                    $147 an hour making $5 minimum bets in any land-based
                    casino.  These
                    results were obtained with fairly slow play on double-zero
                    wheels.        Generate
                    net profits of $735 an hour in online casinos.   With over 1,800 of these casinos to choose
                    from, this offers incredible profit potential.       Win
                    at a documented 97.75% rate.       Consistently deliver these
                    results without ever resorting to making higher wagers.     Incredibly,
                this strategy performs so well, that it really develops an edge
                over the game of roulette -even against the higher house edge
                double-zero games.  Recognizing
                its superior winning strengths, it was aptly named the
                "Maximum Advantage Roulette Strategy."      This
                system only requires making one bet at a time and wins a
                documented 97.75% of the games played.      And,
                because of the low level of wagers used, you can get started
                with this strategy as a $5 better (recommended) with a measly
                $100 investment (I suggest that you use $150 because I am very
                conservat ive).  I
                highly recommend that you "risk" five minutes of your
                time and read more about this proven performer here.

Article suggestion  Got an idea for an article?  Get in touch      By understanding the implied probability of eSports odds, bettors are in a healthier position to make a profit. This article explains how to convert both Decimal and American eSports odds to their implied probability.   What is implied probability?   Implied probability is a vital concept for eSports bettors whether you are looking to bet on individual matches, futures, propositions, or live betting markets.  The implied probability is a conversion of odds into a percentage - whilst taking into account the bookmakers edge - and then eliminates the bookmakers edge to express the true odds of an event occurring.  In eSports betting, the bookmakers edge means the implied probability of an event will always add up to over 100%. The amount over 100% is the bookmakers’ margin. To understand how bookmakers work and to calculate their margin , watch the video below:    Why calculate implied probabilities?   Knowing how to convert betting odds into implied probabilities is vital for all bettors as it helps them assess the potential value on a particular eSports betting market. Once converted, if the implied probability is less than a bettor’s assessment, then it represents value.  For the purpose of this article we will use the odds for the Dota 2 match between Digital Chaos and Virtus.pro.      Implied probabiity odds example        Team Decimal Odds American Odds Implied Probability   Digital Chaos  4.810  +381  20.79%    Virtus.pro  1.192  -520  83.89%          Converting Decimal odds   The calculation for Decimal odds couldn’t be simpler. To calculate the implied probability for Digital Chaos to win follow these 2 stages:  Stage 1: 1 / 4.810  Stage 2: 0.207 x 100  Implied probability: 20.79%  Therefore the odds suggest Digital Chaos has a 20.79% chance of beating Virtus Pro.   Converting American odds   When converting American odds, we have to distinguish between plus and minus numbers.   Calculation for American minus numbers   To calculate the implied probability of Virtus.pro at -520 use these three steps:  Stage 1: (- (-520) / ((- (-520)) + 100)  Stage 2: 520 / (520 + 100)  Stage 3: 0.839 x 100  Implied probability : 83.89%  Therefore the odds suggest Virtus.pro has an 83.89 % chance of winning.  Calculation for American plus numbers  To calculate the implied probability of Digital Chaos at +381 use these three steps:  Stage 1: 100 / (381 + 100)  Stage 2: 100 / 481  Stage 3: 0.207  Implied probability : 20.79%  Therefore the odds suggest Digital Chaos has a 20.79% chance of beating Virtus Pro, which as always, is the same as the decimal odds conversion.  Now you know how to how to convert odds to their implied probability you’re in a better position to find value on your eSports bets.       eSports Home     See the latest eSports odds    Category   Educational     Tags   Explainer    Odds formats    Educational    eSports    CSGO    Dota 2    League of Legends     Share this article on     Facebook     Twitter      Google+    Embed      Embed      Embed code  Affiliate embed     Copy this code to embed the article on your site:    Copy embed code  Embed code copied to clipboard      1.

This calculator will convert "odds for winning" an event or "odds against winning" an event into percentage chances of both winning and losing.  Be careful if you are using sports teams odds or betting odds. If you see that the Patriots	super bowl odds are 9/2, that is most likely "odds against" and should be entered in the calculator with "Odds are: against winning."  When playing a lottery or other games of chance be sure you understand the odds or probability that is reported by the game organizer. A 1 in 500 chance of winning, or probability of winning, is entered into this calculator as "1 to 500 Odds are for winning". You may also see odds reported simply as chance of winning as 500:1. This most likely means "500 to 1 Odds are against winning" which is exactly the same as "1 to 500 Odds are for winning."  Probability Formulas:  This calculator will convert "odds of winning" for an event into a probability percentage chance of success.  Odds, are given as (chances for success) : (chances against success) or vice versa.  If odds are stated as an A to B chance of winning then the probability of winning is given as P W = A / (A + B) while the probability of losing is given as P L = B / (A + B).  For example, you win a game if you pull an ace out of a full deck of 52 cards. Pulling any other card you lose. The chance of winning is 4 out of 52, while the chance against winning is 48 out of 52 (52-4=48). Entering A=4 and B=48 into the calculator as 4:48 odds are for winning you get  For 4 to 48 odds for winning;  Probability of: Winning = (0.0769) or 7.6923% Losing = (0.9231) or 92.3077%  "Odds for" winning: 1:12 (reduced from 4:48) "Odds against" winning: 12:1 (reduced from 48:4)  Further Reading  Probability vs. Odds                                          Cite this content, page or calculator as:  Furey, Edward " Odds Probability Calculator "; from https://www.calculatorsoup.com - Online Calculator Resource.

With that said, it becomes obvious that one type of odds can be converted into another. Although it requires seemingly complicated calculations, these are easier to understand once you get a grip on these three types of odds. There are many tools available to make these conversions, and many online betting websites offer an option to display the odds in the preferred format. If one wants to work it out by themselves, they could refer to the table below:   Converting Odds to Implied Probabilities  Here comes the more interesting part: converting the aforementioned odds to their implied probabilities. Due to the significance of this part, we will not discuss the specific formula related to each type of odds. Rather, let's remember the general rule for the conversion of (any type of) odd into an implied probability.  Rule: Implied probability of an outcome = Stake / total payout  As shown, divide the amount wagered (on stake) by the total payout to get the implied probability of an outcome. If the odds mentioned in the earlier examples (covered in the previous reading) are converted into percentages or implied probabilities, we get the following results:  According to a bookmaker, the implied probability for:  Man City (odds: 8/13) to win against Crystal Palace on April 07, 2015, is 61.9% [{13/(8+13)}*100].  Hillary Clinton (odds: 2.20) to win the 2016 US Presidential elections is 45.45% [(1/2.2)*100].  Australia (odds: -250) to win the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup is 71.43% [{250/(100+250)}*100].  Remember, the odds keep changing as the bets come in, which means bookmakers’ probability estimations vary with time. Moreover, the odds displayed by different bookmakers can vary significantly, meaning that the odds displayed by a bookmaker are not always correct. Note that it's not only important to back winners, but one must do so when the odds accurately reflect the chance of winning. It is relatively easy to say that Man City will win against Crystal Palace, but would you be willing to risk $100 to make a profit of $61.53?  The key is to consider a betting opportunity valuable when the probability assessed for an outcome is higher than the implied probability estimated by the bookmaker.  (For related reading, refer to Are You Investing or Gambling? ).  Why Does The House Always Win?  Basically, the odds on display never reflect the true probability/chance of an event occurring (or not occurring). There is always a profit margin added by the bookmaker in these odds, which means that the payout to the successful punter is always less than what they should have received if the odds had reflected the true chances. This means that the bookmaker needs to estimate the true probability/chance of an outcome correctly in order to set the odds on display in such a way that it profits the bookmaker irrespective of an event outcome.  To support this statement, let’s look at the implied probabilities for each outcome of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup example we had discussed in the first reading on this topic.  Australia: -250 (implied probability = 71.43%)  New Zealand: +200 (implied probability = 33.33%)  If you notice, the total of these probabilities is 104.76% (71.43% + 33.33%). Doesn't that conflict with the fact that the sum of all probabilities must equal 100%? This is because the odds on display are not fair odds.  The percentage above 100% (i.e. 4.76%) represents the bookmaker’s over-round — the bookmaker’s potential profit if the bookie accepts the bets in the right proportion. If you bet on both the teams, you are actually risking $104.46 to get $100 back. From the bookie’s perspective, they are taking in $104.60 and expect to pay out $100 (including the stake), giving them an expected profit of 4.5% (=4.76/104.76), no matter which team wins. The bookie has a built-in edge here.  According to a study published in the Journal of Gambling Studies , the more hands a player wins, the less money they are likely to collect, especially with respect to novice players. According to the research, multiple wins are likely to yield small stakes, for which you need to play more, and the more you play the more likely you will eventually bear the brunt of occasional substantial losses. Here, behavioral economics comes into play. A player continues playing the lottery either in hopes of a big gain that would eventually offset the losses or the winning streak compels him/her to keep playing. In both cases, it is not rational or statistical reasoning but the person's emotions and the high of a win that lead them to play further. (For related reading, refer to The Worst Bets You Can Make at the Casino ).  Consider a casino. Everything — including the game rules, music, controlled lighting effects, alcoholic beverages, the interior decor— is carefully planned and designed to the house's advantage. The house wants you to stay and continue playing. All the games offered by the casino have a built-in house edge, although the house advantage varies with the game. Moreover, novices find it particularly difficult to do cognitive accounting and misjudge the variance of payouts when they have a streak of wins, ignoring the fact that frequent modest gains are eventually overweighed by infrequent significant losses. (For related reading, refer to Investing vs. Gambling: Where Is Your Money Safer? ).  The Bottom Line  A betting opportunity should be considered valuable if the probability assessed for an outcome is higher than the implied probability estimated by the bookmaker. Furthermore, the odds on display never reflect the true probability of an event occurring (or not). The payoff on a win is always less than what one should have received if the odds had reflected the true chances. This is because the bookmaker’s profit margin is included in the odds, which is why the house always wins.
