What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.  If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.  Exercises  Directions: Read each question below. Select your answer by clicking on its button.

Find the probability of getting a head and an odd number. The answer is $\frac{1}{4}$.  My reasoning is that rolling an odd number is $\frac{1}{2}$, and tossing a coin on heads is $\frac{1}{2}$. So $0.5 \times 0.5$ = $\frac{1}{4}$.

The coin and the die are independent of each other, so you can just multiply the probabilities.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 7 '15 at 10:16       Joonas Ilmavirta   18.9k 8 38 75              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Ronald B. | SAT/ACT, Math, and Science Tutor SAT/ACT, Math, and Science Tutor                0            If there are numbers 1-10 on this spinner, that would mean we have the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 as our choices for landing on an Odd number. We have 5/10, numbers to choose from, and if we reduce it means 1/2 of our numbers are odd.  so if we just need an odd number for the spin our probability is 1/2    But, if we need to get an odd number the first AND the second time we must multiply the odds for the first spin (1/2) x the second spin (also 1/2).  1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4        Aug 7 | Ronald B.

everyone. We need to be more precise about how likely something (an
outcome) is to happen. The probability of an outcome can have any
value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). It may be a fraction,
decimal or percentage. When different outcomes of
an event are equally likely (for example, getting a head
when you toss a coin), you can
use a formula to calculate the probability of outcomes. When you throw a fair dice there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 or 6. There are three ways of getting an odd number (1, 3
or 5). So the probability of getting an odd number = the number of ways of getting an odd number ÷ total number of possible outcomes = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2 or 0.5, or 50%. Activity Click to play the probability activity Play Events and probabilities The table below gives some examples of events and how their probability can be calculated.  Event Outcome Number of ways to get this outcome Total number of possible outcomes Probability of outcome Throwing a fair, 6-sided dice Getting an odd number 3 6 3 / 6 Throwing a fair coin Getting 'tails' 1 2 50% Choosing a playing card from a full pack without looking The suit being spades 13 52 13 / 52 Choosing a playing card from a full pack without looking The card being a 'ten' 4 52 4 / 52 Throwing a fair, 6-sided dice Getting a number less than 5 4 6 4 / 6 You may sometimes need to list all the possible outcomes of an event. The key is to work systematically - do not just list all the outcomes randomly. Here is an example: Question Imagine that you had to find all the different orders in which three people (Anita, Benita and Carol) could finish
in a race. The first step (to save you writing too much) is to label the people A, B and C - but make sure you mention this. Jot down the
different orders in which Anita, Benita and Carol could
finish. Answer ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA Make sure you can 'see' the pattern in the order of choices.

What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.  If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.  Exercises  Directions: Read each question below. Select your answer by clicking on its button.

What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.

Find the probability of getting a head and an odd number. The answer is $\frac{1}{4}$.  My reasoning is that rolling an odd number is $\frac{1}{2}$, and tossing a coin on heads is $\frac{1}{2}$. So $0.5 \times 0.5$ = $\frac{1}{4}$.  Is this basically it?    probability  algebra-precalculus  solution-verification     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jul 7 '15 at 10:18       Joonas Ilmavirta   18.9k 8 38 75        asked Jul 7 '15 at 10:15       MathsChecksOut   8 1 3                  Yes. The outcome of the die is independent of the outcome of the coin: $P(d\cap c)=P(d|c)\cdot P(c)=P(d)\cdot P(c)$ – callculus  Jul 7 '15 at 10:19        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  0  down vote  accepted      Yes, this is it.
The coin and the die are independent of each other, so you can just multiply the probabilities.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jul 7 '15 at 10:16       Joonas Ilmavirta   18.9k 8 38 75              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Ronald B. | SAT/ACT, Math, and Science Tutor SAT/ACT, Math, and Science Tutor                0            If there are numbers 1-10 on this spinner, that would mean we have the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 as our choices for landing on an Odd number. We have 5/10, numbers to choose from, and if we reduce it means 1/2 of our numbers are odd.  so if we just need an odd number for the spin our probability is 1/2    But, if we need to get an odd number the first AND the second time we must multiply the odds for the first spin (1/2) x the second spin (also 1/2).  1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4        Aug 7 | Ronald B.

everyone. We need to be more precise about how likely something (an
outcome) is to happen. The probability of an outcome can have any
value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). It may be a fraction,
decimal or percentage. When different outcomes of
an event are equally likely (for example, getting a head
when you toss a coin), you can
use a formula to calculate the probability of outcomes. When you throw a fair dice there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 or 6. There are three ways of getting an odd number (1, 3
or 5). So the probability of getting an odd number = the number of ways of getting an odd number ÷ total number of possible outcomes = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2 or 0.5, or 50%. Activity Click to play the probability activity Play Events and probabilities The table below gives some examples of events and how their probability can be calculated.  Event Outcome Number of ways to get this outcome Total number of possible outcomes Probability of outcome Throwing a fair, 6-sided dice Getting an odd number 3 6 3 / 6 Throwing a fair coin Getting 'tails' 1 2 50% Choosing a playing card from a full pack without looking The suit being spades 13 52 13 / 52 Choosing a playing card from a full pack without looking The card being a 'ten' 4 52 4 / 52 Throwing a fair, 6-sided dice Getting a number less than 5 4 6 4 / 6 You may sometimes need to list all the possible outcomes of an event. The key is to work systematically - do not just list all the outcomes randomly. Here is an example: Question Imagine that you had to find all the different orders in which three people (Anita, Benita and Carol) could finish
in a race. The first step (to save you writing too much) is to label the people A, B and C - but make sure you mention this. Jot down the
different orders in which Anita, Benita and Carol could
finish. Answer ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA Make sure you can 'see' the pattern in the order of choices.
