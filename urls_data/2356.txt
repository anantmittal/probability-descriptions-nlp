She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Jack Solomon , galleryoffreaks.thecomicseries.com Answered Aug 20, 2011 I'm going to be doing some rough estimates hear, based on hearsay and my own flawed assumptions; this is the kind of question that entire thesis papers could be written about. Assuming an average of 300 million sperm per ejaculation(1), with a world population of roughly 3 billion non-sterile men in the world; and assuming that the average man ejaculates an average of once a day(the average man will masturbate at least once a day), you're looking at 900,000,000,000,000,000 (900 quadrillion) potential lives that never happened. Let's also assumed that there are roughly 3 billion women capable of bearing children, and each has roughly 7 days a month during which she's capable of being impregnated. This means there's about a 24% chance that any man ejaculating into that woman's *ahem* will have a 1 in 4 chance of impregnating her. The average couple has sex roughly once a week, which by my basic math puts the odds of you being one of the sperm that impregnates a woman at roughly 1 in 15,625,000,000,000,000,000 or 15 quintillion. The odds of you being one of the sperm your father produced, 1 in 28 billion. You should note that I'm not factoring in things like birth control, miscarriages, death, abortion, etc. Hell, this even assumes that all women over the age of 17 or so are capable of bearing children and in a sexual relationship. I'm just using my own, over-inflated guesstimates to play around with the math of the situation. I hope you enjoyed my thoughts. 1.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question Quora User , something something np-hard innuendo Answered Aug 20, 2011 · Author has 627 answers and 1.3m answer views If you're asking? 1. Oh sorry, include my assumptions and calculations: I assume you're asking (this works for readers too, you can play along!). Since you're asking, you've got a Quora profile. Since you've got a Quora profile, you must be human (because that's the policy). Since you're human (and up and about doing stuff), you were born. And now, for the critical deduction, as something which has happened has happened with probability 1 , you were born with probability 1. On the other hand, maybe you were asking about the probability of being born again?  I dunno, ask Chuck Colson. 1.7k Views · View Upvoters   Gonçalo Perdigão , Quora lover Answered May 29, 2013 We (assuming we're talking about humans but can be used for anything else) are a combination of unique material, so we are unique. The probability of existing someone like us is zero (considering the time-space window). So the answer to the question depends on the time it's done. If the question is done before we were born or after we're died the answer is zero. If it's done during our life, it's 1. Never forget that zero probability events are always occurring...

Answered Aug 20, 2011 · Author has 4.1k answers and 4.4m answer views This question cannot be answered because, as John Arnold says, there is no way to define the negative outcome. The possible ways of not being born are infinite. There is only one you, but there are infinitely many not yous. You can't limit the not yous based on your DNA because there is no upward limit to the length of the genome (that we know of) and all the super humans from the future who are yet to be born are also not you. And even if you did contrive a way to calculate all the possible variations, you'd still have no way to calculate the chances of any one of those variations actually being born. And then you'd have to factor in the hormone levels in your mother's womb, and the environment you're born into. Would you be you if you were born a hundred years ago? If you had an older brother (or not)? 924 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Your personal AI assistant for writing better emails.

If we assume that "humans" are continuously distributed, in the sense that there is no discrete jumps between humans, then any particular event has zero probability; hence the probability of you being born, if we do not know you are born, is zero. The posterior probability is of course 1, that is kind of trivial... 1.3k Views · View Upvoters   John Arnold Answered Aug 20, 2011 This question is poorly formed; it does not make sense.  To assess probability, one must have a clear outcome and an outcome pool (Not technical terms, I'm no statistician, so if there is one please tell me).  You've defined an outcome, birth, but in comparison to what?  Are we evaluating births vs miscarriages?  Vs sperm count, as in Jack Solomon's answer?  Or maybe something else? It's not at all clear how this question should be interpreted, and so cannot be answered. 910 Views · View Upvoters   Dean Carpenter , Hobbyist Physicist Answered Jun 16, 2014 · Author has 3k answers and 1.3m answer views The probability is 1 in order to answer this question, you must exist, and hence you were born 164 Views Related Questions How will children be born in 100 years?

To know this you would need to know how many living creatures are born on the whole planet on a determined lapse of time. We would need an experienced team of biologists to come up with an educated estimation. You have to weigh in all humans, all animal, al insects, all plants, all bateria. That is the hard part. The easy part is just adding up the results and calculate the probabilities. Since the numbers here would be massive, you would probbably have to work in units per second. I don’t know the results but I’d assume the it would be quite a bit like this: 85% chance of being born a bacteria. 7% chance of being born as a plant. 6% chance of being born as an insect. 1.99999% chance of being born as any animal. 0.00001% chance of being born a human. This is every second. Now have in mind that this came out my mind. For accurate result an exhaustive survey should be done and that would be excruciating work. 1.8k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below What is the probability of being born?

Ask New Question   Joe Doe Updated Jan 10, 2018 Nobody knows the precise probability, but it’s definitely almost Infinitely miniature. We would not be around if just one of the following processes hadn’t occurred (each event exponentially less likely to have occured than the event prior to it): Your dad and mom decided to mate at the exact period of time they did. A male is constantly replacing millions of his sperm a day, so if your parents decided to mate a few months post/prior than they did, most likely, a different sperm would’ve met your mother’s egg, and you wouldn’t be born. Even using the fact that they DID mate at the time they did, there were millions of sperm released when they mated, and it had to be the EXACT right one out of millions sperm, with the EXACT right one of ~300,000 eggs from your mom. (Chance of birth is already extraordinary small, and we’re just getting started). The above process applied to your four grandparents…and your eight great-grandparents…and your sixteen great-great-grandparents…and all the way down your ~3.9 billion years of ancestral line. If just ONE of those ancestors died/didn’t have kids for whatever reason, you wouldn’t be born, meaning those exact environmental pressures/ecological events had to occur throughout the history of life on Earth. The right chemicals were at the right place, in the right time, to create some form of biological reaction - the origin of life on Earth (notice I didn’t say on which planet/object this process took place). Large amounts of rock came together to form a more massive ball, which happened to be in the habitable zone of our sun; the ball now known as the Earth. In some nebula far far away, a random mass of some hydrogen and helium had come together, to form the star we now know as our sun ~5 billion years ago. The creation of the sun’s birth nebula. (It’s still unknown to scientists exactly which nebula gave birth to our sun). The big bang. If the universe had never been created, then (quite obviously) the world as we know it wouldn’t have existed. Who knows the probability of the big bang’s occurrence; to this day, nobody knows how the big bang was formed… So that gives you a perspective of how unlikely you are to be born-as a human. You could always look at it another way, however. You’d only know if you existed, and wouldn’t know if you weren’t alive. Therefore, in your realm of consciousness, you’d have a 100% chance of being born. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder If you're looking for arrest records this is a leading source.

Undo Answer Wiki 5 Answers   Brian Gross , Asst Professor of Economics & Env. Studies, Whittier College Updated Jan 2, 2017 · Author has 52 answers and 48.2k answer views More than you might think. For our purposes, let's assume all months have an equal number of days and the distribution of birthdays/birth months is essentially uniform [see Footnote]. This means that each person has a one in twelve chance of having the same birth month as someone else. Let's name our five people A,B,C,D and E. Then the possibilities of two sharing a birth month could be expressed as AB (only A and B share a birth month), AC, AD, AE, BC, … etc. In total there are 5-choose-2 number of such combinations. This number is equal to [math]\frac{5!}{2!\cdot{}(5-2)!}=\frac{20}{2}=10[/math] . So once we know the probability of one of these (since they are all the same), we need only to multiply it by 10 to get the full probability. So what's the probability of AB? [math]Prob(AB)=\frac{1}{12}\cdot{}\frac{11}{12}\cdot{}\frac{10}{12}\cdot{}\frac{9}{12}[/math] How did we get that? B has a 1/12 chance of sharing A’s birth month, and C has a 11/12 chance of NOT sharing that birth month. D then has 10/12 chance of not sharing either A,B or C’s birth month. This leaves E a 9/12 chance of not sharing a birth month with A-D. The calculation then is: [math]Prob=\frac{1}{12}\cdot{}\frac{11}{12}\cdot{}\frac{10}{12}\cdot{}\frac{9}{12}\cdot{}10=\frac{11\cdot{}10\cdot{}9\cdot{}10}{12\cdot{}12\cdot{}12\cdot{}12}[/math] [math]\approx{}47.74[/math] % Surprised? Indeed, this is one of the classic examples for which our intuition of chance does not match reality. It is actually quite likely that among five people two will have birthdays in the same month! [UPDATE: From a comment and other answers I see there is some discrepancy in how the question is interpreted. The calculation above is answering the question: What is the probability that exactly two out of five people (chosen at random) are born in the same month? Aaron Brown excellently breaks down the different ways that 5 peoples’ birth months can be distributed (see Aaron Brown's answer to What is the probability of 2 out of 5 people being born in the same month? ). His answer notes (emphasis added): There are seven possibilities. All five people can be born in the same month in 12 ways (one for each month). You could have four in one month and one in another in 660 ways. You could have three in one month and two in another in 1,320 ways. You could have three on one month and one each in two other months in 13,200 ways. You could have two in one month, two more in another month and one alone in a single month in 19,800 ways. You could have two in one month and the other three in all different months in 118,800 ways . Finally, you could have all five in different months in 95,040 ways. The sum of these numbers is 12^5 = 248,832. I bolded the line/possibility that represents the answer to the question, as I interpret it. [math]\frac{118,800}{248,832}\approx{}47.74[/math] %] [Footnote: The slight variations in distribution of birthdays and number of days in each calendar month will not appreciably change the odds. My guess is, factoring in those realities would change the above probability by a maximum of 2 percentage points.] 726 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Corey Cole , I read "Lady Luck" once Answered Dec 31, 2016 · Author has 318 answers and 358.2k answer views The answer is slightly variable, because months are not all created alike. So I’ll cheat a little and treat all months as being of equal length. In addition, birth rates differ by month; I’ll ignore that too and assume they’re uniform. Person 1 is born in a particular month. We’ll call it June. So far we’re 100% than person 1 was born in *some* month. Person 2 has 1/12 chance of being born in the same month as #1. Otherwise (11/12), two months are now covered. Assuming different months, person 3 has 2/12 chances of matching #1 or #2. Non-match chance is 10/12. Ditto for person 4, but now it’s 3/12. Non-match chance is 9/12. And for person 5, it’s now 4/12. Non-match chance no longer matters. So we get something like this, considering both the match and non-match probabilities: 1/12 + (11/12 * (2/12 + (10/12 * (3/12 + (9/12 * 4/12))))) To resolve this, I started from the right innermost calculation and worked to the left: First we have 4/12. That’s the chance the 5th person matched one of the first four given they were all born in different months. Obviously that’s 1/3 chance, pretty high. 9/12 * 4/12 = 36 / (12 * 3 * 4). That neatly comes out to 1/4 or 0.25 and is the chance that none of the first four was born in the same month *and* the fifth person was born in one of those four months. 3/12 is the chance the 4th person was born in one of 3 particular months. That’s another 0.25, so, we’re at 50% chance just on the last two terms! If the first three are born in 3 different months, one of the last two has a 50% chance of matching one of those months. Now we multiply that 0.5 by 10/12 - this is the chance that the first three birthdays didn’t match. Obviously that’s 5/12 (half of 10/12), or about 0.416667. Ok, getting closer. Add the 2/12 to get 0.583333. One of the last three matched one of the first two. Multiply by 11/12 to get only cases where the first two didn’t match. That’s about 0.534722. Finally, add 1/12 for the chance the first two matched. Final answer 0.618056. So there’s about a 61.8% chance that exactly two of the five have the same birth month. This is non-intuitive, since with five people and 12 months, we expect less than half rather than more than half. That would be the answer you get if you rephrased the question as, “Given five people, what is the probability that at least one of them was born in June.” As you can see, it’s a completely different question. There are formulas you can use to make the calculation easier, but I prefer to do these problems based on direct logic rather than shortcuts, because I can check my premises at each stage. 252 Views · Answer requested by  Erik Hambardzumyan   Lucky Baxter Answered Dec 26, 2016 I’m going to call the 5 random people A,B,C,D and E. The chance of A being born the same month as at least one of the other people is: 4 x 1/12 as each person has a 1/12 chance of being born the same month of A. This equates to a 4/12 chance (I am not going to simplify yet.) Let us assume that A and B were born the same month ( it does not matter if it were A and C or A and D…etc.) it is still possible that C, D or E may also be born in the same month of A and B. Since the question demands exactly 2 people are born the same month we must subtract the occurances where more than 2 people are born the same month. i.e. if A, B and C were born the same month, it would be 3 out of the 5 people sharing birth months not 2 out of 5. Therefore the chance that exactly 2 people out of the 5 share the same birthmonth are: 4/12 - 1/12–1/12–1/12 or 1/12. There is a 1/12 chance that 2 out of 5 random people are born the same month. But there are also other things to consider, like that some Months consist of different amounts of days and that people are more likely to be born in July, August and September. These factors would only have minimal effect on the likelihood of the event occurring, but they still should be acknowdleged.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics) Birthdays: What's the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Bhushan Shah , Interested, but largely ignorant Answered Sep 17, 2012 · Author has 59 answers and 118.6k answer views Easy approximate answer: ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) However, this is more complicated than it looks due to existence of leap years. What if your own birthday occurs on 29th Feb? To account for leap years, let us proceed as follows. Let the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date be p1 if your birthday is not on 29th Feb, and p2 if your birthday is on 29th Feb. The probability we are looking for is then the weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights being the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not. Let us first calculate p1. Bear in mind that there are 97 leap years per 400 years. In these 97 years, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 1/366, and for the other 303 years it is 1/365. Hence, the value of p1 is ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 303 / 400 ) Now we calculate p2 in a similar manner. The only difference is that in the 303 years without a leap year, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 0. Hence, p2 becomes ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + 0 * ( 303 / 400 ) Now to calculate the overall probability, we consider the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not, which are used as weights for p2 and p1 respectively. The final expression then is, ( p1 * ( 303 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) ) + ( p2 * ( 97 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 366. ) ) This expression, which evaluates to 0.000623% (approx) is the accurate probability of meeting someone with the exact same birth date. As expected, this is slightly less than ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ), which is 0.000751%. Of course, this is assuming that all men are immortal, and that meeting someone born in 1900, in 1342, and in 2154 is equiprobable. If you want to take into account mortality, and eliminate people from the future, then this probability will become a function of the current date and time, and you will have to take into account stuff like demographics, average life expectancy etc. Let's not tread there! Though I reckon it wouldn't make much difference to the numerical value of the probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

So the probability that you meet at least 1 person who has the same birthday as you is [math]1-(\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . As a function of the number of people you’ve met, here is the probability that you have met someone who has the same birthday as you: Interestingly enough, you have to meet 1092 people before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you amongst the people you’ve met is greater than 95%. It takes 587 to surpass 80%, and a measly 253 to pass 50%. But wait… this assumes that the probability of someone else having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . This isn’t the case. FiveThirtyEight did an analysis on this. Since cesarean sections (c-sections) are pre-scheduled, people often choose not to have it on days like Christmas or Christmas Eve, and, as such, fewer children are born on these days because only vaginally are children born on these days. Made by FiveThirtyEight with R . This is clearly a flaw in our logic. To account for this, people with birthdays that are above average line marked on this graph are more likely to find someone with the same birthday as them then someone with a birthday below the average line. So, someone born on July 9th would have an easier time finding people born on the same day as him than someone born on Christmas. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics)  Life and Living What is the probability of being born on February 29? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Shubham Sharma , Machine Learning student.Completed stats110 (Joe Blitzstein). Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by UC Berkeley Extension Want to learn basic statistic concepts?

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes! Binazir concludes that the odds of you being alive are basically zero . visual.ly SEE ALSO: See How The Most Popular Baby Names Have Changed Over Time >    More:  Baby  Science  Parents and Kids      facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link           Recommended For You   Powered By Sailthru              Powered By Sailthru                       Follow us on:                  Also check out:           * Copyright © 2018 Business Insider Inc.

One in 10? One in 50? One in 100? If you're over 62, your odds of having at least $1 million in net wealth (your total assets minus your total debt) are relatively achievable — about 1 in 7. But if you are under 40, your odds are low: 1 in 55. In the last 25 years, the odds that an old person is a millionaire have improved slightly. But for young people, they have gotten much worse. These figures come from a new paper by economists at the St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability, which shows evidence of a growing wealth gap that few people are talking about — the gap between the young and the old. The paper, by William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, draws on surveys of 40,000 families that the Fed carried out between 1989 and 2013 to examine the all-important role that your age plays in how much income you make and how much wealth you accumulate. It offers a few clues as to how young people can game the system and end up like their wealthy older counterparts, as well as a lot of evidence to show that things are just different for young people today. One of the most important points that the paper makes is that everyone's income and wealth tend to follow a kind of natural pattern during their life. Young people (generally defined here as those under 40) haven't been working for many years, so they don't have an opportunity to save as much; they also need to make investments in things like education and new home ownership. Middle-aged people (40-61) have been working long enough that they start to accumulate wealth rapidly. And old people (62 and up) begin to draw down on their wealth, to finance their retirement. You can see these trends in this incredible graph below, from their paper. People born in different years (1901, 1904, 1907 and so on) were surveyed at various times between 1989 and 2013 about their median family income. The chart below shows their age on the horizontal axis, and the median family income they reported making at the time on the vertical axis. The slope of each of the different colored lines shows how income was changing for that group between 1989 and 2013. For example, for the youngest generations, who appear on the left-hand side of the graph, the lines sharply slope upward because their net income is rising. World Economic Forum Here's the same graph for wealth (assets minus debt), rather than income. If you compare this with the previous chart, you can see that net worth takes a longer time to amass than income, and then declines less slowly. That's partly because a lot of people take on debt at the beginning of their lives — student debt, mortgages, etc — and thus have negative net worth. It's also because people lose their incomes as they retire, but tend to hold on to their largest sources of net worth, like their homes. World Economic Forum From bad to worse Basically, young people have always been poor. But looking beyond that basic trend, you can see that today's young people are poorer than young people of the past. The period of time in which someone is born can also have a dramatic effect on their wealth compared with other generations. The winners of this historical jackpot appear to be those who were born between 1930 and 1945 and came of age after World War II, who are sometimes called The Silent Generation. Both the Silent Generation and the generation that came before them, called The Greatest Generation because they fought in World War II, benefited from America's rapid economic growth after World War II. (As Thomas Piketty describes in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, this was not necessarily a happy story: The U.S. grew so fast after World War II because it was the only place in the world with manufacturing capacity - Europe had literally been leveled.) But The Silent Generation appears to get an additional boost because they were born during the Great Depression, a time when people had fewer babies overall. Their lower population meant that they had less competition overall for jobs, housing, investments and other opportunities. Sociologist Elwood Carlson called the generation "the lucky few" because they were smaller than the generation that came before. African-Americans and women born in those years had far more opportunity, and the generation also benefited from the expansion of the American safety net, including Social Security and Medicare, during their lives. YouTube/The Pilion Trust Charity "People born in the first half of the 20th century simply may have been in the right place at the right time as they were lifted by a rising tide," the economists write. Then came the Baby Boomers, the populous generation born after World War II. They haven't fared as well as their predecessors, in part because their greater numbers have meant more competition, and perhaps in part because the world is just a different place. The Boomers were the first generation to really experience the effects of globalization and competition from workers in the developing world. That, as well as automation and the decline of labor unions have all eroded wage growth on the lower end of the income spectrum. The charts below illustrate this difference. A sliver of the Greatest Generation, born in 1915-1917, is represented on the far right side of both graphs in teal. Part of the Silent Generation (born 1933-1935) appears in cornflower blue, while some Boomers (born 1954-1956) appear in beige. The horizontal axis shows the person's age, and the vertical axis shows their income (on the left) or median net worth (on the right). If you look at Figure 3 on the right, you can see how much better the Silent Generation did than the generations that came before or after them. Notice where the blue line overlaps with the teal line — that shows that those born between 1933 and 1935 had a much higher net worth in their 70's than those born between 1915 and 1917. In the same graph, the overlap between the blue line and the beige line shows that the Silent Generation also had a higher net worth than the Boomers did when both generations were in their mid to late 50's. World Economic Forum William Emmons, Bryan Noeth and Ray Boshara, St. Louis Fed's Center for Household Financial Stability In just 25 years, the wealth gap between young and old people has yawned wider. In 1989, old families had 7.6 times as much median wealth as young families. By 2013, it had grown to 14.7 times. According to the economists' calculations, someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than an identical person born in 1940. It's not clear exactly why this is, the economists say. The financial crisis and Great Recession certainly set young people back, but young people were doing comparatively worse even before that. And the trends are true even though America's younger generations are its most educated ever. Part of the reason could be that younger Americans are far more diverse than older generations, and race- and ethnicity-based disadvantages continue to loom large in the U.S., the economists say. White and Asian families are far wealthier than black and Hispanic families in the U.S., across all age groups. Flickr The difference may also be due to the difference in financial decisions between young and old people. Old people generally have more diverse investments, carry less debt and are more cushioned against financial shocks than younger people. If young people want to increase their chances of being wealthy, one strategy is to emulate the behavior of older people: keeping an emergency fund, paying down debt, avoiding high-cost credit, and putting money into higher-returning investments, the economists say. One strategy that might work for young people is delaying the purchase of a house. By doing so, young people can save and make a bigger down payment later, and thus lower their debt burden, as well as make more diverse investments in the interim. But even if Millennials and Gen Xers follow these strategies, the historical trends don't appear to be on their side. "Some people are just born lucky," the economists conclude.

According to the National Safety Council, your odds of dying of various causes are:   Heart disease, 1 in 6  Cancer, 1 in 7  Stroke, 1 in 28  Motor vehicle accidents, 1 in 88  Intentional self-harm, 1 in 112  Accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances, 1 in 130  Falls, 1 in 171  Car crashes, 1 in 303  Assault by firearm, 1 in 306  Pedestrian, 1 in 649  Motorcycle rider, 1 in 770  Accidental drowning, 1 in 1,123  Exposure to smoke, fire, 1 in 1,177  Pedalcyclist 1 in 4,717  Firearms discharge, 1 in 6,309  Air and space transport accidents, 1 in 7,032  Electrocution, 1 in 9,943  Excessive natural heat, 1 in 12,517  Cataclysmic storm, 1 in 46,044  Lightning, 1 in 84,079  Legal execution, 1 in 96,691  Dog attack, 1 in 120,864  Earthquake or other ground movement, 1 in 148,756  Flood, 1 in 175,803  Fireworks discharge, 1 in 386,766                         Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                        Tech      Finance      Politics      Strategy      Life      All          BI ACCOUNTS     BUSINESS INSIDER    BI PRIME  SIGN OUT    BI INTELLIGENCE           Edition              A vertical stack of three evenly spaced horizontal lines.

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes! Binazir concludes that the odds of you being alive are basically zero . visual.ly SEE ALSO: See How The Most Popular Baby Names Have Changed Over Time >    More:  Baby  Science  Parents and Kids      facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link           Recommended For You   Powered By Sailthru              Powered By Sailthru                       Follow us on:                  Also check out:           * Copyright © 2018 Business Insider Inc.

It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Jack Solomon , galleryoffreaks.thecomicseries.com Answered Aug 20, 2011 I'm going to be doing some rough estimates hear, based on hearsay and my own flawed assumptions; this is the kind of question that entire thesis papers could be written about. Assuming an average of 300 million sperm per ejaculation(1), with a world population of roughly 3 billion non-sterile men in the world; and assuming that the average man ejaculates an average of once a day(the average man will masturbate at least once a day), you're looking at 900,000,000,000,000,000 (900 quadrillion) potential lives that never happened. Let's also assumed that there are roughly 3 billion women capable of bearing children, and each has roughly 7 days a month during which she's capable of being impregnated. This means there's about a 24% chance that any man ejaculating into that woman's *ahem* will have a 1 in 4 chance of impregnating her. The average couple has sex roughly once a week, which by my basic math puts the odds of you being one of the sperm that impregnates a woman at roughly 1 in 15,625,000,000,000,000,000 or 15 quintillion. The odds of you being one of the sperm your father produced, 1 in 28 billion. You should note that I'm not factoring in things like birth control, miscarriages, death, abortion, etc. Hell, this even assumes that all women over the age of 17 or so are capable of bearing children and in a sexual relationship. I'm just using my own, over-inflated guesstimates to play around with the math of the situation. I hope you enjoyed my thoughts. 1.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Ever wonder how your emails are coming across?

To know this you would need to know how many living creatures are born on the whole planet on a determined lapse of time.

The easy part is just adding up the results and calculate the probabilities. Since the numbers here would be massive, you would probbably have to work in units per second. I don’t know the results but I’d assume the it would be quite a bit like this: 85% chance of being born a bacteria. 7% chance of being born as a plant. 6% chance of being born as an insect. 1.99999% chance of being born as any animal. 0.00001% chance of being born a human.

Ask New Question   Joe Doe Updated Jan 10, 2018 Nobody knows the precise probability, but it’s definitely almost Infinitely miniature. We would not be around if just one of the following processes hadn’t occurred (each event exponentially less likely to have occured than the event prior to it): Your dad and mom decided to mate at the exact period of time they did. A male is constantly replacing millions of his sperm a day, so if your parents decided to mate a few months post/prior than they did, most likely, a different sperm would’ve met your mother’s egg, and you wouldn’t be born. Even using the fact that they DID mate at the time they did, there were millions of sperm released when they mated, and it had to be the EXACT right one out of millions sperm, with the EXACT right one of ~300,000 eggs from your mom. (Chance of birth is already extraordinary small, and we’re just getting started). The above process applied to your four grandparents…and your eight great-grandparents…and your sixteen great-great-grandparents…and all the way down your ~3.9 billion years of ancestral line. If just ONE of those ancestors died/didn’t have kids for whatever reason, you wouldn’t be born, meaning those exact environmental pressures/ecological events had to occur throughout the history of life on Earth. The right chemicals were at the right place, in the right time, to create some form of biological reaction - the origin of life on Earth (notice I didn’t say on which planet/object this process took place). Large amounts of rock came together to form a more massive ball, which happened to be in the habitable zone of our sun; the ball now known as the Earth. In some nebula far far away, a random mass of some hydrogen and helium had come together, to form the star we now know as our sun ~5 billion years ago. The creation of the sun’s birth nebula. (It’s still unknown to scientists exactly which nebula gave birth to our sun). The big bang. If the universe had never been created, then (quite obviously) the world as we know it wouldn’t have existed. Who knows the probability of the big bang’s occurrence; to this day, nobody knows how the big bang was formed… So that gives you a perspective of how unlikely you are to be born-as a human. You could always look at it another way, however. You’d only know if you existed, and wouldn’t know if you weren’t alive. Therefore, in your realm of consciousness, you’d have a 100% chance of being born. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder If you're looking for arrest records this is a leading source.

Undo Answer Wiki 5 Answers   Brian Gross , Asst Professor of Economics & Env. Studies, Whittier College Updated Jan 2, 2017 · Author has 52 answers and 48.2k answer views More than you might think. For our purposes, let's assume all months have an equal number of days and the distribution of birthdays/birth months is essentially uniform [see Footnote]. This means that each person has a one in twelve chance of having the same birth month as someone else. Let's name our five people A,B,C,D and E. Then the possibilities of two sharing a birth month could be expressed as AB (only A and B share a birth month), AC, AD, AE, BC, … etc. In total there are 5-choose-2 number of such combinations. This number is equal to [math]\frac{5!}{2!\cdot{}(5-2)!}=\frac{20}{2}=10[/math] . So once we know the probability of one of these (since they are all the same), we need only to multiply it by 10 to get the full probability. So what's the probability of AB? [math]Prob(AB)=\frac{1}{12}\cdot{}\frac{11}{12}\cdot{}\frac{10}{12}\cdot{}\frac{9}{12}[/math] How did we get that? B has a 1/12 chance of sharing A’s birth month, and C has a 11/12 chance of NOT sharing that birth month. D then has 10/12 chance of not sharing either A,B or C’s birth month. This leaves E a 9/12 chance of not sharing a birth month with A-D. The calculation then is: [math]Prob=\frac{1}{12}\cdot{}\frac{11}{12}\cdot{}\frac{10}{12}\cdot{}\frac{9}{12}\cdot{}10=\frac{11\cdot{}10\cdot{}9\cdot{}10}{12\cdot{}12\cdot{}12\cdot{}12}[/math] [math]\approx{}47.74[/math] % Surprised? Indeed, this is one of the classic examples for which our intuition of chance does not match reality. It is actually quite likely that among five people two will have birthdays in the same month! [UPDATE: From a comment and other answers I see there is some discrepancy in how the question is interpreted. The calculation above is answering the question: What is the probability that exactly two out of five people (chosen at random) are born in the same month? Aaron Brown excellently breaks down the different ways that 5 peoples’ birth months can be distributed (see Aaron Brown's answer to What is the probability of 2 out of 5 people being born in the same month? ). His answer notes (emphasis added): There are seven possibilities. All five people can be born in the same month in 12 ways (one for each month). You could have four in one month and one in another in 660 ways. You could have three in one month and two in another in 1,320 ways. You could have three on one month and one each in two other months in 13,200 ways. You could have two in one month, two more in another month and one alone in a single month in 19,800 ways. You could have two in one month and the other three in all different months in 118,800 ways . Finally, you could have all five in different months in 95,040 ways. The sum of these numbers is 12^5 = 248,832. I bolded the line/possibility that represents the answer to the question, as I interpret it. [math]\frac{118,800}{248,832}\approx{}47.74[/math] %] [Footnote: The slight variations in distribution of birthdays and number of days in each calendar month will not appreciably change the odds. My guess is, factoring in those realities would change the above probability by a maximum of 2 percentage points.] 726 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Corey Cole , I read "Lady Luck" once Answered Dec 31, 2016 · Author has 318 answers and 358.2k answer views The answer is slightly variable, because months are not all created alike. So I’ll cheat a little and treat all months as being of equal length. In addition, birth rates differ by month; I’ll ignore that too and assume they’re uniform. Person 1 is born in a particular month. We’ll call it June. So far we’re 100% than person 1 was born in *some* month. Person 2 has 1/12 chance of being born in the same month as #1. Otherwise (11/12), two months are now covered. Assuming different months, person 3 has 2/12 chances of matching #1 or #2. Non-match chance is 10/12. Ditto for person 4, but now it’s 3/12. Non-match chance is 9/12. And for person 5, it’s now 4/12. Non-match chance no longer matters. So we get something like this, considering both the match and non-match probabilities: 1/12 + (11/12 * (2/12 + (10/12 * (3/12 + (9/12 * 4/12))))) To resolve this, I started from the right innermost calculation and worked to the left: First we have 4/12. That’s the chance the 5th person matched one of the first four given they were all born in different months. Obviously that’s 1/3 chance, pretty high. 9/12 * 4/12 = 36 / (12 * 3 * 4). That neatly comes out to 1/4 or 0.25 and is the chance that none of the first four was born in the same month *and* the fifth person was born in one of those four months. 3/12 is the chance the 4th person was born in one of 3 particular months. That’s another 0.25, so, we’re at 50% chance just on the last two terms! If the first three are born in 3 different months, one of the last two has a 50% chance of matching one of those months. Now we multiply that 0.5 by 10/12 - this is the chance that the first three birthdays didn’t match. Obviously that’s 5/12 (half of 10/12), or about 0.416667. Ok, getting closer. Add the 2/12 to get 0.583333. One of the last three matched one of the first two. Multiply by 11/12 to get only cases where the first two didn’t match. That’s about 0.534722. Finally, add 1/12 for the chance the first two matched. Final answer 0.618056. So there’s about a 61.8% chance that exactly two of the five have the same birth month. This is non-intuitive, since with five people and 12 months, we expect less than half rather than more than half. That would be the answer you get if you rephrased the question as, “Given five people, what is the probability that at least one of them was born in June.” As you can see, it’s a completely different question. There are formulas you can use to make the calculation easier, but I prefer to do these problems based on direct logic rather than shortcuts, because I can check my premises at each stage. 252 Views · Answer requested by  Erik Hambardzumyan   Lucky Baxter Answered Dec 26, 2016 I’m going to call the 5 random people A,B,C,D and E. The chance of A being born the same month as at least one of the other people is: 4 x 1/12 as each person has a 1/12 chance of being born the same month of A. This equates to a 4/12 chance (I am not going to simplify yet.) Let us assume that A and B were born the same month ( it does not matter if it were A and C or A and D…etc.) it is still possible that C, D or E may also be born in the same month of A and B. Since the question demands exactly 2 people are born the same month we must subtract the occurances where more than 2 people are born the same month. i.e. if A, B and C were born the same month, it would be 3 out of the 5 people sharing birth months not 2 out of 5. Therefore the chance that exactly 2 people out of the 5 share the same birthmonth are: 4/12 - 1/12–1/12–1/12 or 1/12. There is a 1/12 chance that 2 out of 5 random people are born the same month. But there are also other things to consider, like that some Months consist of different amounts of days and that people are more likely to be born in July, August and September. These factors would only have minimal effect on the likelihood of the event occurring, but they still should be acknowdleged.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics) Birthdays: What's the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Bhushan Shah , Interested, but largely ignorant Answered Sep 17, 2012 · Author has 59 answers and 118.6k answer views Easy approximate answer: ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) However, this is more complicated than it looks due to existence of leap years. What if your own birthday occurs on 29th Feb? To account for leap years, let us proceed as follows. Let the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date be p1 if your birthday is not on 29th Feb, and p2 if your birthday is on 29th Feb. The probability we are looking for is then the weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights being the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not. Let us first calculate p1. Bear in mind that there are 97 leap years per 400 years. In these 97 years, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 1/366, and for the other 303 years it is 1/365. Hence, the value of p1 is ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 303 / 400 ) Now we calculate p2 in a similar manner. The only difference is that in the 303 years without a leap year, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 0. Hence, p2 becomes ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + 0 * ( 303 / 400 ) Now to calculate the overall probability, we consider the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not, which are used as weights for p2 and p1 respectively. The final expression then is, ( p1 * ( 303 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) ) + ( p2 * ( 97 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 366. ) ) This expression, which evaluates to 0.000623% (approx) is the accurate probability of meeting someone with the exact same birth date. As expected, this is slightly less than ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ), which is 0.000751%. Of course, this is assuming that all men are immortal, and that meeting someone born in 1900, in 1342, and in 2154 is equiprobable. If you want to take into account mortality, and eliminate people from the future, then this probability will become a function of the current date and time, and you will have to take into account stuff like demographics, average life expectancy etc. Let's not tread there! Though I reckon it wouldn't make much difference to the numerical value of the probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Matthew Anderson , Member of the CO/WY ASA Chapter; Statistician for Life Answered Apr 22, 2017 · Author has 146 answers and 271.8k answer views Assuming that there are only 365 birthdays that it’s possible for one to have, we know the probability that 1 person having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . So the probability that someone doesn’t have the same birthday as you is [math]1-\frac{1}{365}=\frac{364}{365}[/math] . The probability that x people don’t have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^x[/math] . Let’s define the parameter n as the number of people you meet. So the probability that out of the n number of people you meet, none of them have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . So the probability that you meet at least 1 person who has the same birthday as you is [math]1-(\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . As a function of the number of people you’ve met, here is the probability that you have met someone who has the same birthday as you: Interestingly enough, you have to meet 1092 people before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you amongst the people you’ve met is greater than 95%. It takes 587 to surpass 80%, and a measly 253 to pass 50%. But wait… this assumes that the probability of someone else having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . This isn’t the case. FiveThirtyEight did an analysis on this. Since cesarean sections (c-sections) are pre-scheduled, people often choose not to have it on days like Christmas or Christmas Eve, and, as such, fewer children are born on these days because only vaginally are children born on these days. Made by FiveThirtyEight with R . This is clearly a flaw in our logic. To account for this, people with birthdays that are above average line marked on this graph are more likely to find someone with the same birthday as them then someone with a birthday below the average line. So, someone born on July 9th would have an easier time finding people born on the same day as him than someone born on Christmas. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

This is a close enough approximation for people who aren't intolerable pedants. So, it's no good for me. Leap years mean that if you are born on a random day, there is a [math]\frac { 97 }{ 146097 } [/math] chance of there being a [math]\frac { 97 }{ 146097 }[/math] chance of someone sharing a birthday with you, and a [math]\frac { 146000 }{ 146097 }[/math] chance of there being a [math]\frac { 400 }{ 146097 } [/math] chance of someone sharing a birthday with you. This comes to a final probability of [math]\frac {19469803}{7114777803}[/math] .

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Shubham Sharma , Machine Learning student.Completed stats110 (Joe Blitzstein). Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.
