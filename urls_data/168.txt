Pregnancy With an IUD: Is It Possible?  Becoming pregnant when you have an IUD isn't common, but it can happen. Find out the symptoms and implications of an IUD pregnancy. By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         wavebreakmedia/ Shutterstock.com  An intrauterine device, or IUD, is one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control -- and it's rare to become pregnant while using one. "The IUD has a 99.7 percent efficacy rate," says Lanalee Araba Sam, M.D., an ob-gyn in Ft. Lauderdale. "Very, very few women with one will become pregnant. But I always tell my patients that someone on this planet is that one-in-a-million exception. There are instances where someone becomes pregnant with an IUD in place." If you're concerned that that could be you, it's completely understandable, since about 25 percent of women stop having their period while on Mirena, a type of IUD that uses the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, says Cristina Perez, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Women's Specialists of Houston at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women. The other type of IUD, ParaGard, uses copper to prevent pregnancy. "ParaGard has no hormones," Dr. Perez explains, so if you're using it, you should still be getting your period as long as you're not pregnant. Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! Symptoms of an IUD pregnancy A pregnancy with an IUD in place typically has the same symptoms as any regular pregnancy -- including breast tenderness, nausea, and fatigue -- so if you're experiencing those symptoms and you have missed your period, call your doctor right away to find out if you're pregnant. It's important to catch such a pregnancy early. An at-home pregnancy test might not indicate a pregnancy as early as a blood test in the office would, so you'll want to be tested by a medical professional. Shop for at-home pregnancy tests IUD pregnancy risks Unfortunately, there are additional risks involved with an IUD pregnancy. "You're 50 percent more likely to miscarry if the IUD is left in place, so the recommendation is to let the pregnancy continue and remove the IUD," says Dr. Sam. But even then, Dr. Sam adds, you're 25 percent more likely to miscarry even if the IUD is removed. So your doctor will want to monitor an IUD pregnancy closely. There's also a higher risk of ectopic or tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies almost always end in loss of the pregnancy, and need to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage to the woman's reproductive system. If you are, in fact, pregnant, your doctor will likely test your blood once, and then again 48 hours later, to make sure the pregnancy hormone, hCG, steadily rises, so he can confirm that your pregnancy is progressing. If it does, it's not an ectopic pregnancy . Pregnancy after an IUD Although becoming pregnant with an IUD in place is rare, getting pregnant after having an IUD removed isn't. (That's good news if you want to conceive, and fair warning if you don't!) If you have decided to try to conceive, give your ob-gyn a call to have your IUD removed, and get busy trying. Some doctors recommend waiting three months after removal before you start trying to conceive, to give your body time to get back to its usual menstrual cycle. This helps you to understand when you're ovulating and most fertile. But according to Dr. Perez, there's no medical need to wait: "You can ovulate and get pregnant the next month!" Are You Pregnant?

Here, doctors explain why that's extremely unlikely (as are all other IUD complications). Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest George Mattei / Getty Images Sarah Brown is hoping to make the U.S. Olympic track team for the 1,500 meter run at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials today, just four months after giving birth . Brown didn’t plan to be pregnant while training for the Olympics, but her copper IUD failed…just as she was running her best race times ever. “I went from crushing workouts to, all of a sudden, in the second interval of a workout, I thought I was running in sand. Racing wasn’t fun anymore,” Brown, 29, told New York magazine’s The Cut . “It was really frustrating because we had concentrated so hard on doing things right, and I didn’t feel like I had overtrained. It was like, ‘Why is this happening? What’s wrong with me?’” Brown eventually took an at-home pregnancy test that was negative, but a few weeks later, she went to see her doctor who determined that she was, in fact, pregnant. Brown’s IUD was removed, and her daughter was born in March. Luckily, doctors say this is extremely rare. “IUDs are a very, very reliable method of birth control,” Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. There are a few different kinds of IUDs, all of which are implanted inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy and last anywhere from three to 10 years. Some contain progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It thickens cervical mucus, making it tougher for sperm to get to an egg. It also thins the uterine lining so that even if the sperm did reach an available egg, the fertilized egg would have a hard time implanting. Then there's the copper IUD, like the kind Brown used. Those work by causing an inflammatory reaction that harms sperm, says Mayo Clinic . At over 99 percent efficacy , IUDs are the real deal when it comes to preventing pregnancy. Jason James, M.D., medical director at Miami's FemCare Ob-Gyn , agrees, but he also notes that even the best birth control can fail. “There’s nothing that’s 100 percent,” he points out. It rarely ever happens, but Whelihan says there are a few ways IUDs can slip up. One is due to insertion error that goes undetected. Doctors recommend that anyone who gets an IUD comes back around a month later to make sure it's still nestled in the right place in the uterus. Whelihan estimates that more than half of people “don’t show up for that visit because they feel fine and it’s an inconvenience, but it’s important." If IUD moves from the upper cavity of the uterus into the lower segment, it won’t be as effective, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF. A person's body can also expel the IUD, meaning it can actually fall out, leaving them unprotected against pregnancy. And finally, people are more likely to get pregnant if their IUD expires, Shepherd says. If someone does get pregnant while using an IUD, they're at a greater risk of having an ectopic pregnancy (when the fetus develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes). “Overall, IUDs prevent pregnancy very well, and the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is lower than that of the general population,” James says. “But if [pregnancy while using an IUD] does occur, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is fairly significant.” Getting pregnant while using an IUD can also result in miscarriage . That’s why if someone suspects or discovers that they're pregnant even though they have an IUD, they need to call their doctor right away. Beyond pregnancy, other uncommon complications are possible with IUDs. Whelihan lists perforation of the uterus as one, which happens when the IUD punctures the wall of the uterus or even goes all the way through it. However, she stresses that it’s pretty rare and happens in only about one in 1,000 cases. There is also a risk of infection, James says, but again, it’s not nearly prevalent enough to be a major concern when deciding to get an IUD. Despite Brown’s situation, doctors stress that IUDs are an extremely safe and reliable way to avoid getting pregnant. “I love IUDs," Shepherd says. "They really are one of the best forms of birth control." Related: These Women Are Live-Tweeting Their Periods And We're Here For It Can Stress Actually Make It Harder To Get Pregnant?

Understanding Mirena     What is Mirena?   Mirena is an intrauterine device (also known as an IUD) that releases small amounts of the hormone levonorgestrel locally into your uterus. Made of soft, flexible plastic, Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider during an office visit. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child.  Mirena offers contraception that's over 99% effective; in fact, it is one of the most effective methods of reversible birth control  Mirena prevents pregnancy for as long as you want, for up to 5 years  You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed by your healthcare provider. In fact, about 8 out of 10 women succeed at becoming pregnant within 1 year of having Mirena removed            Is Mirena FDA-approved?   Mirena was approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 2000 for intrauterine contraception and in 2009 to treat heavy periods for women who choose intrauterine contraception. Discuss all safety considerations with your healthcare provider and use Mirena according to the Prescribing Information . No birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena is right for you.         What is Mirena made of?   Mirena is made of soft, flexible plastic and contains the hormone levonorgestrel. See what Mirena looks like      How does Mirena work to prevent pregnancy?   Mirena prevents pregnancy, most likely in several ways:  Thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from entering your uterus  Inhibiting sperm from reaching or fertilizing your egg  Thinning the lining of your uterus      While there's no single explanation for how Mirena works, most likely these actions work together to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years.          What about hormones and Mirena?   Mirena contains a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel that is often used in birth control pills. Because Mirena releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Mirena does not contain estrogen.        Are there any placement-related complications?   Mirena may attach to or go through the wall of the uterus and cause other problems. If Mirena comes out, use backup birth control like condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider. Some women may experience cramping or pain, bleeding and/or dizziness during and after Mirena is placed. Tell your healthcare provider if your cramps are severe. If your symptoms last for more than 30 minutes, let your healthcare provider know. Mirena may not have been properly placed and your healthcare provider should examine you.    How effective is Mirena at preventing pregnancy?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Unfortunately, no birth control method, including Mirena, is 100% perfect. Once Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider, it is over 99% effective and works continuously to prevent pregnancy. So you don't have to think about taking birth control every day or even every year. You just do a self-check of the threads of Mirena once a month to make sure it's in place. Be sure to ask your healthcare provider to explain how. If you have trouble finding the threads, or can't feel the threads, call your healthcare provider. And in the meantime, be sure to use a backup form of non-hormonal birth control. It is important to think about your daily, weekly and monthly routine and how that may affect which birth control method is best for you. The chart below shows the chance of becoming pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. The most effective methods, including intrauterine devices such as Mirena, are found at the top of the chart. If you have any questions about this information, please ask your healthcare provider. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Safety Considerations and the Patient Information.         How can Mirena help with family planning decisions?   With Mirena, you get effective contraception for up to 5 years and flexibility because you can have it removed by your healthcare provider whenever you want to try to have a child. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. In fact, within a year of having Mirena removed, approximately 8 out of 10 women succeeded at becoming pregnant.    What if I haven't decided whether or not I want more children?   Mirena may be a good choice for you because it continuously prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years. But Mirena is reversible. Should you decide you do want to try to become pregnant, Mirena
can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider. Or, if at the end of the 5 years you're still undecided, you can have another Mirena placed.    What happens if I become pregnant while using Mirena?   One risk of becoming pregnant while using Mirena is called ectopic pregnancy. This means that the pregnancy is not in the uterus. It may occur in the fallopian tubes. Signs of ectopic pregnancy may include unusual vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention and often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility and even death, so it is important to call your healthcare provider right away if you think that you're pregnant. There are also risks if you become pregnant while using Mirena and the pregnancy is in the uterus. Severe infection, miscarriage, premature delivery and even death can occur with pregnancies that continue with an intrauterine device (IUD). Because of this, your healthcare provider may try to remove Mirena, even though removing it may cause a miscarriage. If Mirena cannot be removed, talk with your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of continuing the pregnancy. If you continue your pregnancy, see your healthcare provider regularly. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs of infection. It is not known if Mirena can cause long-term effects on the fetus if it stays in place during a pregnancy.    Can Mirena protect me from HIV or STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)?   No. Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs. So, if while using Mirena you think you or your partner might be at risk of getting an STD, use a condom and call your healthcare provider.    Does Mirena contain any metal?   No, Mirena does not contain any metal. It is made of soft, flexible plastic.        Back to Top   Is Mirena right for me?   Who is Mirena right for?   Mirena is a hormone-releasing IUD (intrauterine device) placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy for as long as you want for up to 5 years. Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child. Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you . Mirena offers a flexible birth control option if:   You want birth control you don't have to think about taking every day  You had a baby and want to explore your birth control options. Click here for more information for new moms  You want to have more children in the future  You are happy with your family size the way it is  You are unsure if you want more children  You want birth control that is also approved to treat heavy periods   Start a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena may be right for you.      Who should not use Mirena?   Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you. As the two of you discuss your options, there are a number of things you should share—like your general health, current or past health conditions, sexual history and whether you'd like to have more children in the future. Mirena is not appropriate for women who:   Are or might be pregnant; Mirena cannot be used as an emergency contraceptive  Have had a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) unless you have had a normal pregnancy after the infection went away  Have an untreated pelvic infection now  Have had a serious pelvic infection in the past 3 months after a pregnancy  Can get infections easily. For example, if you have:  Multiple sexual partners or your partner has multiple sexual partners  Problems with your immune system  Intravenous drug abuse    Have or suspect you might have cancer of the uterus or cervix  Have bleeding from the vagina that has not been explained  Have liver disease or a liver tumor  Have breast cancer or any other cancer that is sensitive to progestin (a female hormone), now or in the past  Have an intrauterine device in your uterus already  Have a condition of the uterus that changes the shape of the uterine cavity, such as large fibroid tumors  Are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, polyethylene, silica, barium sulphate or iron oxide      What should I tell my healthcare provider when deciding if Mirena is right for me?   You should share any current or past health conditions that you have with your healthcare provider to help you both decide if Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) may be right for you. Your healthcare provider needs to know if you:   Have had a heart attack  Have had a stroke  Were born with heart disease or have problems with your heart valves  Have problems with blood clotting or take medicine to reduce clotting  Have high blood pressure  Recently had a baby or if you are breastfeeding  Have severe migraine headaches   What else should you discuss with your healthcare provider?     How do I get Mirena?   Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to understand if Mirena is a good option for you. If it is, then Mirena can usually be placed in your healthcare provider's office at your next visit.    Will my health insurance plan cover Mirena?   Learn how to check with your insurance company.    Why would I consider Mirena?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control that lasts as long as you want, for up to 5 years. Because it can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider, it's reversible and you're free to keep your family planning options open. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Patient Information .        Back to Top   How to get Mirena      Are there any potential serious complications with Mirena?   Some serious but uncommon side effects of Mirena include:  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Some IUD users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease. PID is usually sexually transmitted. You have a higher chance of getting PID if you or your partner have sex with other partners. PID can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic pain that does not go away. PID is usually treated with antibiotics. More serious cases of PID may require surgery. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is sometimes needed. In rare cases, infections that start as PID can even cause death.  Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of PID: long-lasting or heavy bleeding, unusual vaginal discharge, low abdominal (stomach area) pain, painful sex, chills, or fever.  A life-threatening infection called sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), may occur within the first few days after Mirena is placed. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe pain or unexplained fever shortly after Mirena is placed.  Perforation . Mirena may become attached to (embedded) or go through the wall of the uterus. This is called perforation. If this occurs, Mirena may no longer prevent pregnancy. If perforation occurs, Mirena may move outside the uterus and can cause internal scarring, infection or damage to other organs. Surgery may be needed to have Mirena removed. The risk of perforation is increased if Mirena is inserted while you are breastfeeding.      What are the more common side effects of Mirena?   Possible common side effects of Mirena include: Placement discomfort . Pain, bleeding or dizziness may occur during and after placement. This is common. Let your healthcare provider know if the cramping is severe. If your symptoms do not stop 30 minutes after placement, Mirena may not have been placed correctly. Your healthcare provider will examine you to see if Mirena needs to be replaced or removed.  Expulsion . Mirena may come out by itself and no longer prevent pregnancy. Symptoms of partial or complete expulsion may include bleeding, pain and an increase in menstrual flow. If this occurs, Mirena may be replaced within 7 days of a menstrual period after pregnancy has been ruled out. If you think that Mirena has come out, use a back-up form of birth control such as condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider.  Missed menstrual periods . About 20% of women stop having periods after 1 year of Mirena use. Your periods will return once Mirena is removed. If you do not have a period for 6 weeks during Mirena use, contact your healthcare provider to rule out pregnancy.  Changes in bleeding . You may have bleeding and spotting between menstrual periods, especially during the first 3 to 6 months. Sometimes the bleeding is heavier than usual at first. However, the bleeding usually becomes lighter than usual and may be irregular. Call your healthcare provider if the bleeding remains heavier than usual or increases after it has been light for a while.  Cysts on the ovary . About 12 out of 100 women using Mirena develop a cyst on the ovary. These cysts usually disappear on their own in a month or two. However, cysts can cause pain and may sometimes require surgery.  This is not a complete list of side effects with Mirena. For more information, ask your healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the manufacturer at 1-888-842-2937, or at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .     Will my partner be able to feel Mirena during intercourse?   You and your partner shouldn't feel Mirena during intercourse, because Mirena is placed in the uterus, not the vagina. Sometimes your partner feels the threads. If this occurs, talk to your healthcare provider.

					Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception.      IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Mirena.  Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Mirena comes out, tell your healthcare provider (HCP). If Mirena comes out, use back-up birth control. Mirena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.  Pregnancy while using Mirena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.  Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.  Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.   Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs.  Only you and your HCP can decide if Mirena is right for you.  Mirena is available by prescription only.

How long does it take to get pregnant after removing IUD?   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Q: I removed my Mirena IUD two months ago. How long will it take to get pregnant? A: The mirena IUD (intrauterine device) is a hormone-releasing contraceptive that is placed in the uterus and delivers a small amount of hormone (progestin) directly to the uterus - this form of contraception needs to be placed by a healthcare provider and is effective for up to five years.  The mirena IUD is not only a very effective contraceptive but is also beneficial for the treatment of disorders such as abnormal uterine bleeding.  The IUD is placed within seven days of the start of the menstrual period and is 99% effective as a contraceptive.  A woman may try to conceive right after the IUD is removed. It takes the average young couple about 4-6 months to conceive and after one year approximately 85-90% of couples will conceive.

Scar tissue that develops around the coils prevents sperm from reaching the egg.     The Essure system is a type of permanent birth control for women. It cannot be reversed.  This type of female sterilization involves placing small metal and fiber coils in the fallopian tubes, which creates scar tissue that prevents sperm from reaching an egg. During the procedure, the doctor inserts a flexible tube with a small camera (hysteroscope) through the vagina and cervix and up to the uterus. From here, the doctor can see the opening to the fallopian tubes and place the Essure system coils into them.  It takes about three months for the Essure system to prevent pregnancy. In some women, it may take up to six months. During this time, you must use another form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Essure doesn't protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).      Why it's done The Essure system is a type of female sterilization. It's a permanent way to prevent pregnancy.  Benefits of using the Essure system include:   It works very well. The risk of pregnancy is about 0.1 percent when the coils are placed properly.  The procedure can be done in the doctor's office. Little or no anesthesia is needed.  You can return to daily activities the day of the procedure.  There's no incision or scarring of the skin.  After your doctor confirms the system is working and your tubes are blocked, you'll no longer need to buy contraception, other than products used to prevent STIs.  Most women report no long-term side effects.   The Essure system isn't right for everyone, however. Your health care provider may recommend other methods of contraception if:   You aren't sure whether or not you want to become pregnant in the future.  You have a metal allergy. The materials used in the inserts may contain traces of nickel or other metals. You may need allergy testing before the procedure.  You're allergic to the contrast (dye) used during follow-up imaging tests to confirm the procedure worked.  You have an autoimmune disease, which may trigger excessive inflammation around the coil inserts.  You've had a baby or an abortion within the past six weeks.  You have or recently had a pelvic infection.  A health condition of the uterus or fallopian tubes blocks the tube openings, which means the doctor can't properly place the Essure system.  You've had your tubes tied (tubal ligation).   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Risks Researchers continue to study the risks associated with or possibly linked to the Essure system. They may include:   Pelvic pain  Allergic reaction, including hives, itching and face swelling  Heavy periods or spotting during ovulation  Infection from the procedure  Perforation of the uterus or fallopian tubes  Shifting of the coils to other places in the abdominal cavity   Sometimes, the coils aren't placed properly or only one tube becomes blocked. This can result in unintended pregnancy. However, less than 1.5 out of 1,000 women get pregnant with the Essure system. When pregnancy occurs, it's usually because:   Pregnancy occurred before the procedure.  The coils weren't placed properly.  Back-up contraception wasn't used for three to six months following the procedure, or until the doctor confirmed tubal blockage.   If you do get pregnant after having the Essure procedure, there's a higher chance that it will be an ectopic pregnancy — when fertilization happens outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. Talk with your doctor right away if you have a positive pregnancy test after the Essure procedure.  After you have the Essure system implanted, you may not be able to have pelvic procedures involving electrosurgery, such as some types of endometrial ablation.  The Essure system doesn't offer protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  How you prepare Your health care provider will ask you why you are choosing sterilization and explain that the Essure system can't be reversed. You'll talk about the things that might cause you to later regret your decision, such as young age or an unstable relationship. Together, you'll review the risks and benefits of reversible versus permanent contraception.  Before your Essure system procedure, your health care provider will explain the following things:   Details of the procedure, including the best time to do it  Side effects and risks  Reasons why the procedure may fail  The need to use backup contraception for three months after the procedure, or until tubal blockage is confirmed  The risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and why and when your partner should use a condom   Your health care provider needs a clear view of your fallopian tube openings to insert the Essure system. For this reason, it's often best to do the procedure shortly after your period, when the lining of the uterus is thin. If you have irregular periods, your health care provider may recommend medication to thin this lining. Options include birth control pills, rings or patches that contain progestin (alone or with estrogen) or an injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera).  What you can expect    Essure placement Essure placement With the Essure system, your doctor implants metal coils in each fallopian tube. Eventually, scar tissue develops, blocking the tubes and preventing sperm from reaching the egg. No incision is necessary.     The procedure to insert the Essure system coils can be done in your health care provider's office. It typically takes 30 minutes or less. You may be given medication before the procedure to prevent pain and reduce spasm of your fallopian tubes, which can make insertion difficult.  During the procedure Your health care provider places the Essure system inside your fallopian tubes using a hysteroscope, a thin tube with a camera lens attached, as a guide. The scope passes through your vagina and cervix into your uterus, where it provides a view of the opening of each fallopian tube. If the opening to the tubes can be seen, the health care provider inserts the tiny Essure coils through a catheter attached to the scope and up inside each tube.  After the procedure You may go home immediately after the procedure and return to your normal activities the same day. The most common side effects after the procedure are:   Cramping  Abdominal pain  Nausea or vomiting   Contact your health care provider immediately if you have severe or persistent pelvic pain or a coil falls out.  You must use another form of contraception for three months after the procedure. Around this time, your health care provider will order X-rays or other imaging tests to confirm the coils are in the right position and the fallopian tubes are blocked. If the procedure is successful, you can stop using other forms of birth control at this point.  You should still have a period each month. The Essure system doesn't affect your monthly cycle. If you stop having periods or think you're pregnant at any time after the procedure, contact your health care provider immediately.  The Essure system cannot be reversed.

Pregnancy With an IUD: Is It Possible?  Becoming pregnant when you have an IUD isn't common, but it can happen. Find out the symptoms and implications of an IUD pregnancy. By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         wavebreakmedia/ Shutterstock.com  An intrauterine device, or IUD, is one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control -- and it's rare to become pregnant while using one. "The IUD has a 99.7 percent efficacy rate," says Lanalee Araba Sam, M.D., an ob-gyn in Ft. Lauderdale. "Very, very few women with one will become pregnant. But I always tell my patients that someone on this planet is that one-in-a-million exception. There are instances where someone becomes pregnant with an IUD in place." If you're concerned that that could be you, it's completely understandable, since about 25 percent of women stop having their period while on Mirena, a type of IUD that uses the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, says Cristina Perez, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Women's Specialists of Houston at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women. The other type of IUD, ParaGard, uses copper to prevent pregnancy. "ParaGard has no hormones," Dr. Perez explains, so if you're using it, you should still be getting your period as long as you're not pregnant. Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! Symptoms of an IUD pregnancy A pregnancy with an IUD in place typically has the same symptoms as any regular pregnancy -- including breast tenderness, nausea, and fatigue -- so if you're experiencing those symptoms and you have missed your period, call your doctor right away to find out if you're pregnant. It's important to catch such a pregnancy early. An at-home pregnancy test might not indicate a pregnancy as early as a blood test in the office would, so you'll want to be tested by a medical professional. Shop for at-home pregnancy tests IUD pregnancy risks Unfortunately, there are additional risks involved with an IUD pregnancy. "You're 50 percent more likely to miscarry if the IUD is left in place, so the recommendation is to let the pregnancy continue and remove the IUD," says Dr. Sam. But even then, Dr. Sam adds, you're 25 percent more likely to miscarry even if the IUD is removed. So your doctor will want to monitor an IUD pregnancy closely. There's also a higher risk of ectopic or tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies almost always end in loss of the pregnancy, and need to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage to the woman's reproductive system. If you are, in fact, pregnant, your doctor will likely test your blood once, and then again 48 hours later, to make sure the pregnancy hormone, hCG, steadily rises, so he can confirm that your pregnancy is progressing. If it does, it's not an ectopic pregnancy . Pregnancy after an IUD Although becoming pregnant with an IUD in place is rare, getting pregnant after having an IUD removed isn't. (That's good news if you want to conceive, and fair warning if you don't!) If you have decided to try to conceive, give your ob-gyn a call to have your IUD removed, and get busy trying. Some doctors recommend waiting three months after removal before you start trying to conceive, to give your body time to get back to its usual menstrual cycle. This helps you to understand when you're ovulating and most fertile. But according to Dr. Perez, there's no medical need to wait: "You can ovulate and get pregnant the next month!" Are You Pregnant?

Here, doctors explain why that's extremely unlikely (as are all other IUD complications). Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest George Mattei / Getty Images Sarah Brown is hoping to make the U.S. Olympic track team for the 1,500 meter run at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials today, just four months after giving birth . Brown didn’t plan to be pregnant while training for the Olympics, but her copper IUD failed…just as she was running her best race times ever. “I went from crushing workouts to, all of a sudden, in the second interval of a workout, I thought I was running in sand. Racing wasn’t fun anymore,” Brown, 29, told New York magazine’s The Cut . “It was really frustrating because we had concentrated so hard on doing things right, and I didn’t feel like I had overtrained. It was like, ‘Why is this happening? What’s wrong with me?’” Brown eventually took an at-home pregnancy test that was negative, but a few weeks later, she went to see her doctor who determined that she was, in fact, pregnant. Brown’s IUD was removed, and her daughter was born in March. Luckily, doctors say this is extremely rare. “IUDs are a very, very reliable method of birth control,” Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. There are a few different kinds of IUDs, all of which are implanted inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy and last anywhere from three to 10 years. Some contain progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It thickens cervical mucus, making it tougher for sperm to get to an egg. It also thins the uterine lining so that even if the sperm did reach an available egg, the fertilized egg would have a hard time implanting. Then there's the copper IUD, like the kind Brown used. Those work by causing an inflammatory reaction that harms sperm, says Mayo Clinic . At over 99 percent efficacy , IUDs are the real deal when it comes to preventing pregnancy. Jason James, M.D., medical director at Miami's FemCare Ob-Gyn , agrees, but he also notes that even the best birth control can fail. “There’s nothing that’s 100 percent,” he points out. It rarely ever happens, but Whelihan says there are a few ways IUDs can slip up. One is due to insertion error that goes undetected. Doctors recommend that anyone who gets an IUD comes back around a month later to make sure it's still nestled in the right place in the uterus. Whelihan estimates that more than half of people “don’t show up for that visit because they feel fine and it’s an inconvenience, but it’s important." If IUD moves from the upper cavity of the uterus into the lower segment, it won’t be as effective, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF. A person's body can also expel the IUD, meaning it can actually fall out, leaving them unprotected against pregnancy. And finally, people are more likely to get pregnant if their IUD expires, Shepherd says. If someone does get pregnant while using an IUD, they're at a greater risk of having an ectopic pregnancy (when the fetus develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes). “Overall, IUDs prevent pregnancy very well, and the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is lower than that of the general population,” James says. “But if [pregnancy while using an IUD] does occur, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is fairly significant.” Getting pregnant while using an IUD can also result in miscarriage . That’s why if someone suspects or discovers that they're pregnant even though they have an IUD, they need to call their doctor right away. Beyond pregnancy, other uncommon complications are possible with IUDs. Whelihan lists perforation of the uterus as one, which happens when the IUD punctures the wall of the uterus or even goes all the way through it. However, she stresses that it’s pretty rare and happens in only about one in 1,000 cases. There is also a risk of infection, James says, but again, it’s not nearly prevalent enough to be a major concern when deciding to get an IUD. Despite Brown’s situation, doctors stress that IUDs are an extremely safe and reliable way to avoid getting pregnant. “I love IUDs," Shepherd says. "They really are one of the best forms of birth control." Related: These Women Are Live-Tweeting Their Periods And We're Here For It Can Stress Actually Make It Harder To Get Pregnant?

How Can You Get Pregnant Using an IUD?  By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | May 5, 2017 05:33pm ET                            MORE               Credit: Image Point Fr/Shutterstock     A woman's photo of her newborn baby — just delivered, and with the intrauterine device (IUD) that failed to prevent her pregnancy clenched in his tiny fist — has gone viral. But how does a woman get pregnant while using an IUD?  The woman, Lucy Hellein of Fort Mitchell, Alabama, posted the photo of her newborn son to Facebook last week with the caption “Mirena fail!" according to Metro.co.uk . (The photo has since been removed, but not before it was shared tens of thousands of times on social media.) A surgeon discovered the IUD behind the placenta during the delivery, according to Metro. Hellein told Metro that this was her third Mirena IUD, which she had inserted last summer. But in December, she found out she was 18 weeks pregnant. Her doctors initially assumed the IUD had fallen out, but then it turned up during her C-section.  An IUD is a type of long-acting, reversible contraception that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. [ 11 Big Fat Pregnancy Myths ]  Pregnancy among women who have IUDs is very rare. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), IUDs are one of the most effective forms of birth control , with a failure rate of less than 1 percent during the first year of typical use. That's about the same rate as sterilization procedures such as "tube tying," ACOG said. According to Mirena, which makes a hormonal type of IUD, fewer than eight out of 1,000 women (0.8 percent) become pregnant over five years using the device.  Still, in rare cases, pregnancy can occur. For example, the IUD can slip partly or completely out of the uterus, which happens in about 5 percent of users during the first year, ACOG said. This is most likely to occur soon after the device is inserted, and if this happens, a woman can get pregnant. Mirena advises its users to check about once a month to see if the device is in the right place. Women can do this by feeling for the threads attached to the device that extend down from the uterus into the top of the vagina.  Less commonly, the IUD may move and become embedded in the uterus, and very rarely, the device may pierce the uterus. If this happens, the device also does not protect against pregnancy and must be removed, according to Medscape. [ Are You Pregnant? 10 Early Signs of Pregnancy ]  Some IUDs also do not necessarily protect against pregnancy as soon as they are inserted. IUDs made from copper start working right away, but hormonal IUDs protect against pregnancy right away only if they are inserted during the first seven days of a woman's period, according to Planned Parenthood. If a hormonal IUD is inserted at another time in a woman's cycle, it takes seven days before the device is effective, and women should use another type of birth control, such as condoms, during this time, Planned Parenthood says.  Women who do become pregnant while they have an IUD inserted face a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy , which occurs when an embryo implants outside of the uterus, according to Planned Parenthood. Up to half of pregnancies that occur with the Mirena IUD in place are likely to be ectopic, according to the company. In clinic trials with the device, 0.1 percent of users had an ectopic pregnancy in a single year, the company said.  If a woman becomes pregnant with an IUD and the pregnancy is inside the uterus, she has a risk of a severe infection, miscarriage and premature delivery, Mirena said. Because of this, doctors may try to remove an IUD if a woman becomes pregnant.  Hellein's son, Dexter Tyler, was born on April 27, weighing about 9 pounds. "Although he wasn't planned, my family and I feel incredibly blessed," Hellein told Metro.   Original article on Live Science .

You CAN get pregnant (even says on the commercial.. but also my dr told me while i was considering it) AND not only is it possible, but it is life threatening, because it would most likely be an ectopic pregnancy. IF you feel you might be pregnant, you need to tell your OB ASAP. Good luck.

She no longer uses it.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/17/11               13 found this helpful     Yes you can. I have been on Mirena for 3 years and I just found out that I&#39;m 9 weeks pregnant. The only thing I&#39;m scared about us that the dr could not find my Mirena so I&#39;m not sure if it came out by itself or if its in there somewhere. He did tell me that there is a chance the baby could abort because of it but then that he has delivered several babies whose moms still had the Mirena inside and it came out with the afterbirth. So I&#39;m praying that everything goes good and my baby is healthy. This would be my 4th child. We were shocked at first because we are not prepared for one more. But we are happy now!                 mmadrigal783    Answered 10/22/13               10 found this helpful     DIRECTLY FROM MIRENA'S WEBSITE:

Q:What if I become pregnant while using Mirena?

A: Unfortunately, no birth control method, including Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) or tubal ligation (getting your tubes tied), is 100% perfect. If you do get pregnant while using a birth control method, there may be risks to you and your baby. Here we talk about the risks of getting pregnant while Mirena is still in place.

Over the course of 5 years, fewer than 8 in 1,000 women become pregnant while using Mirena. One risk of getting pregnant while using Mirena is called ectopic pregnancy, when the pregnancy is not in the uterus. It may occur in the fallopian tubes. Signs of ectopic pregnancy may include unusual bleeding or abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention and often surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility and even death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you think that you're pregnant.

I switched from the pill (which I was on for 3 and a half years) to the iud about 7 months ago. I never had any problems with the pill and my and my boyfriend have never used condoms and I never got pregnant.. Until I switched to this form of birth control. I just found out I was pregnant on Sunday. So do not be fooled.. YOU CAN DEFINITELY GET PREGNANT ON MIRENA.                 londoncoffer    Answered 1/2/13               8 found this helpful     I had so many &quot;symptoms&quot; but wasn&#39;t pregnant either. I&#39;m hoping that means that when I get my BFP that the real symptoms aren&#39;t actually that bad. PMS and early pregnancy symptoms are the same because they are caused by the same hormone - progesterone. During your 2ww, your body is preparing itself to be pregnant whether or not your cycle will end in a viable pregnancy. This is a just in case mechanism so that your body is prepared for any possible pregnancy. So your body does act as though it is pregnant for roughly two weeks out of every cycle in preparation. If you are indeed pregnant, those symptoms will lengthen and intensify. New ones will appear too as your pregnancy progresses and hCG accumulates. I&#39;d suggest you to read this book from http://pregnancyhours.com that can help you to get pregnant fast and have a healthy pregnancy. Guaranteed! I tried this too and it&#39;s worked.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/30/15               8 found this helpful     I just found out two days ago that I am pregnant. I&#39;ve been on mirena for a year and a half. Unfortunately the pregnancy is etopic so just yesterday, the day after I found out about the pregnancy, I had to be given a shot to terminate. I was about 4 weeks along. My mirena will be removed in a week.                 brittnee3541    Answered 9/20/13               7 found this helpful           / 12                 Reason for reporting   Offensive or inappropriate materials  Spamming or advertising  Vulgarity or profanity  Personal attack  Invasion of privacy  Copyright infringement       Cancel    Submit       Thank you for your feedback.

Created with Sketch.                  Comment                 Photo: Suphat Bhandharangsri/Getty Images      A while back, I took my two young sons to the park. It was a beautiful late summer day, the clouds tatty and thin, like an unraveling of cotton candy. They ran and tackled each other in the grass. It was the kind of day where I let myself relax into feeling lucky.          Later, at home, I took a pregnancy test, the kind with two dark lines for positive. I remember taking those tests over and over, trying for our first. Squinting, willing a second line into existence. I am glad those days are over. I was taking the test because my breasts were hot and sore and my period was late. I was taking the test so I could stop that little worm of worry that kept getting into my throat. I have an IUD — there was only a slim chance. Such a wafer of a chance. And besides, my husband and I were done. We were past done. I was just starting to get myself back: I’d lost the baby weight and then some; I was writing again; my days weren’t filled with the carrying of children. Often, my arms were empty, and that felt like freedom.    Days with my children are both routine and freewheeling, bursting with creativity and mired in drudgery. Every moment feels untidy, unkempt, pre-defined, both beyond my control and demanding of it. My child complained that I was taking too long. I was rushing around my head, planning lunch and naps and maybe a brief, quiet window of writing. Then they bloomed before me, life emphatic, a yes to the question I never even wanted to ask.      Two dark lines.  No, was my immediate response.     My IUD was placed eight weeks after my second child was born. My oldest had hand, foot, and mouth; he was feverish and pleading in the waiting room, Let’s go, Mom. Let’s go home. But I did not want to risk getting pregnant again — the thought made me feel weak, ill. Power through, I told myself. Just power through. A cheerful midwife came in. I remember nothing she said. I do remember how terribly she hurt me when placing the IUD, because the IUD I had between the births of my sons hadn’t hurt nearly as much. I also remember how long it took for her to complete the procedure, and how desperately sad I felt looking at my oldest, red-faced and staring, powering through.    I’d made the requisite follow-up appointment to have the IUD placement checked. But I never went to that appointment, likely fearing the return of the sadness I felt in that white room, how out of my reach any semblance of control in my life felt.  At six weeks pregnant I was scheduled for an ultrasound so they could locate the IUD. It had migrated, and was now lodged in the rear right of my uterus, like Pooh stuck in Rabbit’s door. Two doctors, an ultrasound tech, and an ultrasound-tech-in-training stared at the screen, squinting and pointing and quibbling, while one of them held a probe inside my cervix, jabbing it here and there. “Oh, there’s the baby,” someone said, as the wand passed what looked like a blinking kidney bean. I barely made it to the car before the tears came, sloppily tumbling down my face and onto my coat. I called my husband and told him I wanted an abortion.  I didn’t have an abortion .    It’s hard to explain why I never went through with it. I realized I’d never truly faced what I would do if I were ever put in the position of an unwanted pregnancy. Each time I had been pregnant before, it was because I had wanted to be; the yearning for a child was so real that it was painful. Now, unwillingly pregnant at age 37, I had no idea if I was capable of either option: another baby, or ridding myself of a pregnancy. Each option felt equally terrifying.    I went to the internet, craving a sign at the very least, a definitive answer at most. What I found was surprising: of the information on abortion, most was targeted to or written by single, childless women who wanted to remain that way. I could not find any useful information about married mothers who are done having babies. It felt, and it feels, like an anomaly. Like the universe is saying, What’s one more child?  Or, What are you, a monster?  Because I could not decide, I didn’t decide. I wept and I raged. I allowed myself the rare moments of excitement. I went to my second doctor’s appointment. At some point, as I listened to my doctor describe the minutiae of blood tests and ultrasounds, she stopped herself. Maybe she saw something in my face.  “I’m sorry. I’m assuming you want to continue with this pregnancy. Is that a safe assumption?”  And I began sobbing.  She let me cry, and she explained my options. My in-network hospital would not perform abortions, so I’d need to be referred to another one. (Writing this from a more stable place, I would like to say fuck that hospital.) I could take a series of pills that would stop the production of progesterone and cause a miscarriage up until nine or ten weeks; if I chose to end the pregnancy after that it would be a surgical procedure. I was still crying, worrying the tissue she’d handed me into wilted confetti. The doctor asked me, quietly, had I experienced depression after my last two births?    Yes.  Had I ever had suicidal thoughts?  Yes.  There it was, the truth: I hadn’t healed from the birth of my second son, nearly two years prior, and I hadn’t healed from the birth of my first, almost five years ago. My trauma was right there; I was coated in it, a ghosty afterbirth that I could ignore but never wash off. She handed me a card for a therapist, hugged me, and told me everything would be okay. No matter what I chose.       I wish I could say my decision hit me like a lightning bolt, or a glowy miracle, or a loud, twinkly epiphany. I wish I could say my feelings about it are more clear, now that I’ve veered onto the keep-it fork in the road. I wish I could explain how I even got here. I can’t. I believe all women should have the right to choose, and that they should be supported before, during, and after. I believe abortion should be safe and legal, and I cheer for all the women who exercise their right to choose, and I ache for them. Life is hard either way.  If I could distill my decision down, it would be this: I need help. I need a lot of help. I will stop pretending that I don’t. I let that doctor hug me, and I hugged her back. I find myself in deep conversations with other women, strangers sometimes, about motherhood and abortion and how nothing is simple . I search their words for light, and the light always comes.  About a month ago, I found out I was having a girl. I had long ago made my peace with not having a daughter , though I used to long for one. “You said ‘a girl,’ right?” I asked the woman on the phone. And then I cried. They are leaving the IUD in because it is too risky to remove it. They hope it comes out with the birth but if not, there will need to be a surgical procedure. The presence of the IUD can cause preterm labor; it has perforated my uterus and that might cause an infection. This is my second “geriatric pregnancy,” so there will be a lot of extra monitoring. Still, she perseveres. Her heartbeat is strong; she kicks her legs in defiance of the ultrasounds. I feel the fury of her flutters.  In my first pregnancy, when I found out I was having a boy, my mother told me she was glad. That boys are special, chosen. I think of that, and I think of this girl, this “determined little nugget,” as a friend called her, and how she ignited upon landing, how she lit everything up, how she seems to have chosen me . Maybe I can’t explain how I got here because it wasn’t ever my decision. Life emphatic, a girl I welcome and fear. Not that she’s asking.

More than 99% effective  Works for up to 10 years  ‘Fit and forget’ contraception – you don’t need to do anything  There are two types: one with hormones, one without hormones  Your period might change. There might be more or less bleeding   This page explains the IUD, and tells you how to get one.  WHAT IS AN INTRA UTERINE DEVICE (IUD)?  An IUD is a small, T-shaped object that goes inside your uterus.  There are two types of IUDs:   Copper IUD - contains copper, a type of metal  Hormonal IUD – contains the hormone progestogen (Mirena or Jaydess)   The IUD is put in your uterus by an experienced nurse or doctor. This is simple and safe and takes about 5 to 10 minutes.  You can’t feel it or tell it is there except by checking for the strings. Your partner should not be able to feel it. You can still use tampons.  The removal strings come out of your cervix and curl up inside the top of your vagina – they don’t hang outside.  HOW DOES IT WORK?  The hormones or the copper stop the sperm reaching the egg. Sometimes, sperm does reach the egg (fertilisation) so the IUD stops the egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus.  HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?  Copper and hormonal IUDs are at least 99% effective. Only 1 in 100 people will get pregnant each year.  HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?  The copper IUD is free if you are a New Zealand resident. If you want a copper IUD, you need two appointments - one to check if it’s the right choice for you, and another to have it put in. If you are under 22, appointments are free.  The hormonal IUD comes with an extra cost .  WHAT WILL I NOTICE?  Some people might notice some changes to their period, while others might not.  With a copper IUD, your periods might be longer, heavier and more painful, especially in the first few months. This usually gets better with time.  With a hormonal IUD (Mirena or Jaydess), you might have spotting in the first few months and then light or no periods.  CAN I GET PREGNANT AFTER THE IUD IS TAKEN OUT?  Yes, you will be able to get pregnant as soon as the IUD is taken out.  Pregnancy is very rare with the IUD. If you do get pregnant with an IUD in, there is no extra risk for your baby. You will need to have the IUD taken out during pregnancy.  WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES?   Long acting – it lasts for up to 10 years  Reversible – you can choose to have it taken out at any time. After that, you will be able to get pregnant again  99% effective – it works very well  You don’t need to think about contraception every day  Does not affect breastfeeding  Does not get in the way of sex  The copper IUD does not contain any hormones  The copper IUD can also be used as emergency contraception  The hormonal IUD has a very small amount of hormones and most people have no side effects from this  The Mirena (a hormonal IUD) can help with period bleeding and pain, and most will have light bleeding or no periods at all.   Studies show that IUDs do NOT cause pimples, headaches, sore breasts, nausea, mood changes, loss of sex drive or weight gain. There is no evidence of an extra risk of cancer.  WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES?   Some people feel pain, cramps or dizziness when the IUD is put in or taken out.   There are some risks from having an IUD put in:   There is a small risk of infection (about 1%) when an IUD is put in  There is a very small risk of damage to the uterus (about 1 in 1000 people)  A copper IUD might give you more bleeding and cramping during your period, but this usually gets better over time  The copper IUD can cause an allergic reaction, but this is very rare  The hormonal IUD might give you irregular or light bleeding  The IUD can sometimes come out by itself (about 5% of all IUDs). You can check the strings are still in the right place at any time.   WHO CAN GET AN IUD?  Most people can use an IUD, including those who are young and those who have not had children.  Hormonal IUDs are a really good option if you have heavy periods.  If you have an infection, you should get it treated before you get an IUD put in.  If you have heavy or painful periods you should not get a copper IUD because it might make them worse.  WHEN CAN I GET AN IUD?  An IUD can be put in at any time you choose. You must not already be pregnant.  Some good times to get it put in are:   While you have your period or just after  6 weeks after your baby is born  At the time of a surgical abortion  As emergency contraception after unprotected sex (copper IUD).   DOES IT PROTECT ME FROM STIS?  No. You need to use condoms and lubricant to protect yourself from sexually transmissible infections (STIs). If there is a chance you may have an STI, have a check-up.  HOW DO I GET AN IUD?   Make an appointment at Family Planning .  At your first appointment, the nurse will ask you some questions about yourself and your health to check that the IUD is the right choice for you. They’ll explain what you need to know about having an IUD. They might also suggest you have an STI test.  Read the “Getting your IUD” page so you feel ready for your next appointment. If you have any questions, write them down to ask the nurse.  At your second appointment, the nurse will put the IUD in.

After a photo of a baby holding the IUD that was supposed to prevent it went viral, we asked an expert to explain how the hell that happens. SHARE TWEET Gabby Bess May 5 2017, 8:49pm Thank God for birth control. Modern medicine has given women have the ability to choose when they become pregnant, and the IUD in particular has made it simpler than ever to control our reproductive system. If you can endure some of its annoying side effects , all you have to do is pop that sucker in and forget about it for up to 10 years. With yesterday's House vote to repeal the ACA and many of its protections for women's health, it may be more important than ever to have this longterm solution. But as we all witnessed in horror when a new mom's Instagram of her baby holding her failed IUD went viral, there is a possibility that the birth control method can be unsuccessful at preventing pregnancy. According to reports , Lucy Hellein gave birth to a nine-pound, one-ounce boy on April 27, even though she had a Mirena IUD—which works by releasing a low level of levonorgestrel into the uterine system—inserted last year. To capture the irony, she placed the IUD in her newborn's hand for a photo after it was removed from her placenta. She captioned the image, "Mirena fail!" Read more:  How Well Does Lil Wayne Know Vaginas? We Asked a Gynecologist Hellein told the Independent that she was shocked when she found out that she was pregnant. Reading her story, I was shocked, too. I don't want this to happen to me! Going through several different disaster scenarios in my mind, I also started to wonder: What do I do if it does? "All methods of contraception have a failure rate ," Dr. Colleen Krajewski, a consultant at Bedsider , a non-profit birth control support network operated by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , reminded me to calm me down. But a "Mirena fail!" is rare. "To use rough estimates, about one out of four women using condoms become pregnant, about one in ten women using birth control pills become pregnant, and about two in 1000 become pregnant on Mirena," she said. "In other words, if a car full of women were all using condoms as their only contraception, one is likely to become pregnant; one woman out of an elevator full of women using pills; and one out of a concert hall full of women using IUDs." The fact that IUD pregnancies are so rare is part of why they're shocking to hear about, Dr. Krajewski adds. But in Hellein's case, her IUD was still inside of her when she gave birth, which is the part that disturbed me the most. Her doctor thought it had fallen out since it didn't show up on her initial ultrasound, but it hadn't. What's up with that? "In the very, very, very rare event that a woman becomes pregnant with an IUD in place, on the ultrasound the IUD often appears 'displaced'—and in fact it is—by the pregnancy," Dr. Krajewski explained. "When a pregnancy is growing in a uterus, the IUD moves. It's hard to say which came first." Dr. Krajewski says it's not harmful to your health to have an IUD and a pregnancy at the same time. If you decide to remain pregnant, it's not harmful for the fetus, either. "The hormone in Mirena is progesterone. It's not harmful to a pregnancy," she said. "In fact, your body produces high levels of progesterone in pregnancy—it's 'pro-gestational.'" It can be hard to tell when you've missed a period when you have an IUD since Mirena lightens menstruation. Hellien says she didn't know until she was 18 weeks , when she went to the doctor. "This delay can be very scary for patients to think about, which is understandable," Dr. Krajewski says. So if you're paranoid about the small risk and are definitely not interested in carrying a pregnancy, she recommends that you "use the money saved on tampons and pads to buy a few tests to keep at home for peace of mind."

So if you're sexually active and looking for birth control that provides the greatest peace of mind, an IUD is probably your best bet.  An IUD is a T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a physician. Hormonal IUDs release progesterone, and copper IUDs release copper. Both substances kill sperm and make the uterine lining uninhabitable to fertilized eggs. A hormonal IUD can prevent pregnancy for up to five years, and a copper one works for up to 10 years. While this form of birth control is highly effective, its success in preventing pregnancy is dependent on whether the device stays in place correctly. To help ensure correct placement, the IUD has a string that hangs out through the cervix into the vagina so that the woman can occasionally check. Physicians usually recommend that a woman have regular checkups with her gynecologist to monitor the IUD. It is especially important to have an IUD examined four to six weeks after it is first inserted.            Just because IUDs are highly effective doesn't mean there's no chance you can get pregnant while using them -- although there are differing opinions on which of the two types of IUDs (hormonal and copper) is most effective.  Some research has suggested there's a 2 percent risk of getting pregnant with a hormonal IUD and an.8 percent risk of conceiving with a copper IUD [source: Palo Alto Medical Foundation ]. Those figures, of course, reflect typical use. If the devices are used perfectly, this same research shows that the risk of pregnancy with a hormonal IUD is reduced to 1.5 percent risk, and that of a copper IUD goes down to.6 percent [source: Palo Alto Medical Foundation ]. However, other studies show that the chances of getting pregnant from a hormonal IUD are 2 in 1,000; whereas the odds with a copper IUD are 6 in 1,000 [source: WebMD ].  If you do get pregnant while using an IUD, it can increase your odds of a miscarriage or difficult pregnancy. Complications can include pre-term delivery, vaginal bleeding, clinical chorioamnioitis and placental abruption [source: Kim, et. al ].  Ectopic pregnancy has also been associated with IUD use. (An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fetus begins developing somewhere outside the uterus, such as a fallopian tube.) It isn't that IUD use leads to ectopic pregnancy so much as it increases the risk of a fertilized egg developing elsewhere because conception in the uterus has been blocked [source: Daiter ]. In general, copper IUDs are less likely to lead to ectopic pregnancy than progesterone IUDs [source: Daiter ].

Understanding Mirena     What is Mirena?   Mirena is an intrauterine device (also known as an IUD) that releases small amounts of the hormone levonorgestrel locally into your uterus. Made of soft, flexible plastic, Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider during an office visit. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child.  Mirena offers contraception that's over 99% effective; in fact, it is one of the most effective methods of reversible birth control  Mirena prevents pregnancy for as long as you want, for up to 5 years  You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed by your healthcare provider. In fact, about 8 out of 10 women succeed at becoming pregnant within 1 year of having Mirena removed            Is Mirena FDA-approved?   Mirena was approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 2000 for intrauterine contraception and in 2009 to treat heavy periods for women who choose intrauterine contraception. Discuss all safety considerations with your healthcare provider and use Mirena according to the Prescribing Information . No birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena is right for you.         What is Mirena made of?   Mirena is made of soft, flexible plastic and contains the hormone levonorgestrel. See what Mirena looks like      How does Mirena work to prevent pregnancy?   Mirena prevents pregnancy, most likely in several ways:  Thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from entering your uterus  Inhibiting sperm from reaching or fertilizing your egg  Thinning the lining of your uterus      While there's no single explanation for how Mirena works, most likely these actions work together to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years.          What about hormones and Mirena?   Mirena contains a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel that is often used in birth control pills. Because Mirena releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Mirena does not contain estrogen.        Are there any placement-related complications?   Mirena may attach to or go through the wall of the uterus and cause other problems. If Mirena comes out, use backup birth control like condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider. Some women may experience cramping or pain, bleeding and/or dizziness during and after Mirena is placed. Tell your healthcare provider if your cramps are severe. If your symptoms last for more than 30 minutes, let your healthcare provider know. Mirena may not have been properly placed and your healthcare provider should examine you.    How effective is Mirena at preventing pregnancy?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Unfortunately, no birth control method, including Mirena, is 100% perfect. Once Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider, it is over 99% effective and works continuously to prevent pregnancy. So you don't have to think about taking birth control every day or even every year. You just do a self-check of the threads of Mirena once a month to make sure it's in place. Be sure to ask your healthcare provider to explain how. If you have trouble finding the threads, or can't feel the threads, call your healthcare provider. And in the meantime, be sure to use a backup form of non-hormonal birth control. It is important to think about your daily, weekly and monthly routine and how that may affect which birth control method is best for you. The chart below shows the chance of becoming pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. The most effective methods, including intrauterine devices such as Mirena, are found at the top of the chart. If you have any questions about this information, please ask your healthcare provider. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Safety Considerations and the Patient Information.         How can Mirena help with family planning decisions?   With Mirena, you get effective contraception for up to 5 years and flexibility because you can have it removed by your healthcare provider whenever you want to try to have a child. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. In fact, within a year of having Mirena removed, approximately 8 out of 10 women succeeded at becoming pregnant.    What if I haven't decided whether or not I want more children?   Mirena may be a good choice for you because it continuously prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years. But Mirena is reversible. Should you decide you do want to try to become pregnant, Mirena
can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider. Or, if at the end of the 5 years you're still undecided, you can have another Mirena placed.    What happens if I become pregnant while using Mirena?   One risk of becoming pregnant while using Mirena is called ectopic pregnancy. This means that the pregnancy is not in the uterus. It may occur in the fallopian tubes. Signs of ectopic pregnancy may include unusual vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention and often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility and even death, so it is important to call your healthcare provider right away if you think that you're pregnant. There are also risks if you become pregnant while using Mirena and the pregnancy is in the uterus. Severe infection, miscarriage, premature delivery and even death can occur with pregnancies that continue with an intrauterine device (IUD). Because of this, your healthcare provider may try to remove Mirena, even though removing it may cause a miscarriage. If Mirena cannot be removed, talk with your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of continuing the pregnancy. If you continue your pregnancy, see your healthcare provider regularly. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs of infection. It is not known if Mirena can cause long-term effects on the fetus if it stays in place during a pregnancy.    Can Mirena protect me from HIV or STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)?   No. Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs. So, if while using Mirena you think you or your partner might be at risk of getting an STD, use a condom and call your healthcare provider.    Does Mirena contain any metal?   No, Mirena does not contain any metal. It is made of soft, flexible plastic.        Back to Top   Is Mirena right for me?   Who is Mirena right for?   Mirena is a hormone-releasing IUD (intrauterine device) placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy for as long as you want for up to 5 years. Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child. Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you . Mirena offers a flexible birth control option if:   You want birth control you don't have to think about taking every day  You had a baby and want to explore your birth control options. Click here for more information for new moms  You want to have more children in the future  You are happy with your family size the way it is  You are unsure if you want more children  You want birth control that is also approved to treat heavy periods   Start a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena may be right for you.      Who should not use Mirena?   Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you. As the two of you discuss your options, there are a number of things you should share—like your general health, current or past health conditions, sexual history and whether you'd like to have more children in the future. Mirena is not appropriate for women who:   Are or might be pregnant; Mirena cannot be used as an emergency contraceptive  Have had a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) unless you have had a normal pregnancy after the infection went away  Have an untreated pelvic infection now  Have had a serious pelvic infection in the past 3 months after a pregnancy  Can get infections easily. For example, if you have:  Multiple sexual partners or your partner has multiple sexual partners  Problems with your immune system  Intravenous drug abuse    Have or suspect you might have cancer of the uterus or cervix  Have bleeding from the vagina that has not been explained  Have liver disease or a liver tumor  Have breast cancer or any other cancer that is sensitive to progestin (a female hormone), now or in the past  Have an intrauterine device in your uterus already  Have a condition of the uterus that changes the shape of the uterine cavity, such as large fibroid tumors  Are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, polyethylene, silica, barium sulphate or iron oxide      What should I tell my healthcare provider when deciding if Mirena is right for me?   You should share any current or past health conditions that you have with your healthcare provider to help you both decide if Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) may be right for you. Your healthcare provider needs to know if you:   Have had a heart attack  Have had a stroke  Were born with heart disease or have problems with your heart valves  Have problems with blood clotting or take medicine to reduce clotting  Have high blood pressure  Recently had a baby or if you are breastfeeding  Have severe migraine headaches   What else should you discuss with your healthcare provider?     How do I get Mirena?   Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to understand if Mirena is a good option for you. If it is, then Mirena can usually be placed in your healthcare provider's office at your next visit.    Will my health insurance plan cover Mirena?   Learn how to check with your insurance company.    Why would I consider Mirena?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control that lasts as long as you want, for up to 5 years. Because it can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider, it's reversible and you're free to keep your family planning options open. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Patient Information .        Back to Top   How to get Mirena      Are there any potential serious complications with Mirena?   Some serious but uncommon side effects of Mirena include:  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Some IUD users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease. PID is usually sexually transmitted. You have a higher chance of getting PID if you or your partner have sex with other partners. PID can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic pain that does not go away. PID is usually treated with antibiotics. More serious cases of PID may require surgery. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is sometimes needed. In rare cases, infections that start as PID can even cause death.  Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of PID: long-lasting or heavy bleeding, unusual vaginal discharge, low abdominal (stomach area) pain, painful sex, chills, or fever.  A life-threatening infection called sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), may occur within the first few days after Mirena is placed. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe pain or unexplained fever shortly after Mirena is placed.  Perforation . Mirena may become attached to (embedded) or go through the wall of the uterus. This is called perforation. If this occurs, Mirena may no longer prevent pregnancy. If perforation occurs, Mirena may move outside the uterus and can cause internal scarring, infection or damage to other organs. Surgery may be needed to have Mirena removed. The risk of perforation is increased if Mirena is inserted while you are breastfeeding.      What are the more common side effects of Mirena?   Possible common side effects of Mirena include: Placement discomfort . Pain, bleeding or dizziness may occur during and after placement. This is common. Let your healthcare provider know if the cramping is severe. If your symptoms do not stop 30 minutes after placement, Mirena may not have been placed correctly. Your healthcare provider will examine you to see if Mirena needs to be replaced or removed.  Expulsion . Mirena may come out by itself and no longer prevent pregnancy. Symptoms of partial or complete expulsion may include bleeding, pain and an increase in menstrual flow. If this occurs, Mirena may be replaced within 7 days of a menstrual period after pregnancy has been ruled out. If you think that Mirena has come out, use a back-up form of birth control such as condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider.  Missed menstrual periods . About 20% of women stop having periods after 1 year of Mirena use. Your periods will return once Mirena is removed. If you do not have a period for 6 weeks during Mirena use, contact your healthcare provider to rule out pregnancy.  Changes in bleeding . You may have bleeding and spotting between menstrual periods, especially during the first 3 to 6 months. Sometimes the bleeding is heavier than usual at first. However, the bleeding usually becomes lighter than usual and may be irregular. Call your healthcare provider if the bleeding remains heavier than usual or increases after it has been light for a while.  Cysts on the ovary . About 12 out of 100 women using Mirena develop a cyst on the ovary. These cysts usually disappear on their own in a month or two. However, cysts can cause pain and may sometimes require surgery.  This is not a complete list of side effects with Mirena. For more information, ask your healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the manufacturer at 1-888-842-2937, or at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .     Will my partner be able to feel Mirena during intercourse?   You and your partner shouldn't feel Mirena during intercourse, because Mirena is placed in the uterus, not the vagina. Sometimes your partner feels the threads. If this occurs, talk to your healthcare provider.

					Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception.      IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Mirena.  Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Mirena comes out, tell your healthcare provider (HCP). If Mirena comes out, use back-up birth control. Mirena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.  Pregnancy while using Mirena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.  Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.  Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.   Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs.  Only you and your HCP can decide if Mirena is right for you.  Mirena is available by prescription only.

Pregnancy With an IUD: Is It Possible?  Becoming pregnant when you have an IUD isn't common, but it can happen. Find out the symptoms and implications of an IUD pregnancy. By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         wavebreakmedia/ Shutterstock.com  An intrauterine device, or IUD, is one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control -- and it's rare to become pregnant while using one. "The IUD has a 99.7 percent efficacy rate," says Lanalee Araba Sam, M.D., an ob-gyn in Ft. Lauderdale. "Very, very few women with one will become pregnant. But I always tell my patients that someone on this planet is that one-in-a-million exception. There are instances where someone becomes pregnant with an IUD in place." If you're concerned that that could be you, it's completely understandable, since about 25 percent of women stop having their period while on Mirena, a type of IUD that uses the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, says Cristina Perez, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Women's Specialists of Houston at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women. The other type of IUD, ParaGard, uses copper to prevent pregnancy. "ParaGard has no hormones," Dr. Perez explains, so if you're using it, you should still be getting your period as long as you're not pregnant. Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! Symptoms of an IUD pregnancy A pregnancy with an IUD in place typically has the same symptoms as any regular pregnancy -- including breast tenderness, nausea, and fatigue -- so if you're experiencing those symptoms and you have missed your period, call your doctor right away to find out if you're pregnant. It's important to catch such a pregnancy early. An at-home pregnancy test might not indicate a pregnancy as early as a blood test in the office would, so you'll want to be tested by a medical professional. Shop for at-home pregnancy tests IUD pregnancy risks Unfortunately, there are additional risks involved with an IUD pregnancy. "You're 50 percent more likely to miscarry if the IUD is left in place, so the recommendation is to let the pregnancy continue and remove the IUD," says Dr. Sam. But even then, Dr. Sam adds, you're 25 percent more likely to miscarry even if the IUD is removed. So your doctor will want to monitor an IUD pregnancy closely. There's also a higher risk of ectopic or tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies almost always end in loss of the pregnancy, and need to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage to the woman's reproductive system. If you are, in fact, pregnant, your doctor will likely test your blood once, and then again 48 hours later, to make sure the pregnancy hormone, hCG, steadily rises, so he can confirm that your pregnancy is progressing. If it does, it's not an ectopic pregnancy . Pregnancy after an IUD Although becoming pregnant with an IUD in place is rare, getting pregnant after having an IUD removed isn't. (That's good news if you want to conceive, and fair warning if you don't!) If you have decided to try to conceive, give your ob-gyn a call to have your IUD removed, and get busy trying. Some doctors recommend waiting three months after removal before you start trying to conceive, to give your body time to get back to its usual menstrual cycle. This helps you to understand when you're ovulating and most fertile. But according to Dr. Perez, there's no medical need to wait: "You can ovulate and get pregnant the next month!" Are You Pregnant?

Here, doctors explain why that's extremely unlikely (as are all other IUD complications). Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest George Mattei / Getty Images Sarah Brown is hoping to make the U.S. Olympic track team for the 1,500 meter run at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials today, just four months after giving birth . Brown didn’t plan to be pregnant while training for the Olympics, but her copper IUD failed…just as she was running her best race times ever. “I went from crushing workouts to, all of a sudden, in the second interval of a workout, I thought I was running in sand. Racing wasn’t fun anymore,” Brown, 29, told New York magazine’s The Cut . “It was really frustrating because we had concentrated so hard on doing things right, and I didn’t feel like I had overtrained. It was like, ‘Why is this happening? What’s wrong with me?’” Brown eventually took an at-home pregnancy test that was negative, but a few weeks later, she went to see her doctor who determined that she was, in fact, pregnant. Brown’s IUD was removed, and her daughter was born in March. Luckily, doctors say this is extremely rare. “IUDs are a very, very reliable method of birth control,” Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. There are a few different kinds of IUDs, all of which are implanted inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy and last anywhere from three to 10 years. Some contain progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It thickens cervical mucus, making it tougher for sperm to get to an egg. It also thins the uterine lining so that even if the sperm did reach an available egg, the fertilized egg would have a hard time implanting. Then there's the copper IUD, like the kind Brown used. Those work by causing an inflammatory reaction that harms sperm, says Mayo Clinic . At over 99 percent efficacy , IUDs are the real deal when it comes to preventing pregnancy. Jason James, M.D., medical director at Miami's FemCare Ob-Gyn , agrees, but he also notes that even the best birth control can fail. “There’s nothing that’s 100 percent,” he points out. It rarely ever happens, but Whelihan says there are a few ways IUDs can slip up. One is due to insertion error that goes undetected. Doctors recommend that anyone who gets an IUD comes back around a month later to make sure it's still nestled in the right place in the uterus. Whelihan estimates that more than half of people “don’t show up for that visit because they feel fine and it’s an inconvenience, but it’s important." If IUD moves from the upper cavity of the uterus into the lower segment, it won’t be as effective, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF. A person's body can also expel the IUD, meaning it can actually fall out, leaving them unprotected against pregnancy. And finally, people are more likely to get pregnant if their IUD expires, Shepherd says. If someone does get pregnant while using an IUD, they're at a greater risk of having an ectopic pregnancy (when the fetus develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes). “Overall, IUDs prevent pregnancy very well, and the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is lower than that of the general population,” James says. “But if [pregnancy while using an IUD] does occur, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is fairly significant.” Getting pregnant while using an IUD can also result in miscarriage . That’s why if someone suspects or discovers that they're pregnant even though they have an IUD, they need to call their doctor right away. Beyond pregnancy, other uncommon complications are possible with IUDs. Whelihan lists perforation of the uterus as one, which happens when the IUD punctures the wall of the uterus or even goes all the way through it. However, she stresses that it’s pretty rare and happens in only about one in 1,000 cases. There is also a risk of infection, James says, but again, it’s not nearly prevalent enough to be a major concern when deciding to get an IUD. Despite Brown’s situation, doctors stress that IUDs are an extremely safe and reliable way to avoid getting pregnant. “I love IUDs," Shepherd says. "They really are one of the best forms of birth control." Related: These Women Are Live-Tweeting Their Periods And We're Here For It Can Stress Actually Make It Harder To Get Pregnant?

Mirena prevents pregnancy, most likely in several ways:  Thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from entering your uterus  Inhibiting sperm from reaching or fertilizing your egg  Thinning the lining of your uterus      While there's no single explanation for how Mirena works, most likely these actions work together to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years.          What about hormones and Mirena?   Mirena contains a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel that is often used in birth control pills. Because Mirena releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Mirena does not contain estrogen.        Are there any placement-related complications?   Mirena may attach to or go through the wall of the uterus and cause other problems. If Mirena comes out, use backup birth control like condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider. Some women may experience cramping or pain, bleeding and/or dizziness during and after Mirena is placed. Tell your healthcare provider if your cramps are severe. If your symptoms last for more than 30 minutes, let your healthcare provider know. Mirena may not have been properly placed and your healthcare provider should examine you.    How effective is Mirena at preventing pregnancy?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Unfortunately, no birth control method, including Mirena, is 100% perfect. Once Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider, it is over 99% effective and works continuously to prevent pregnancy. So you don't have to think about taking birth control every day or even every year. You just do a self-check of the threads of Mirena once a month to make sure it's in place. Be sure to ask your healthcare provider to explain how. If you have trouble finding the threads, or can't feel the threads, call your healthcare provider. And in the meantime, be sure to use a backup form of non-hormonal birth control. It is important to think about your daily, weekly and monthly routine and how that may affect which birth control method is best for you. The chart below shows the chance of becoming pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. The most effective methods, including intrauterine devices such as Mirena, are found at the top of the chart. If you have any questions about this information, please ask your healthcare provider. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Safety Considerations and the Patient Information.         How can Mirena help with family planning decisions?   With Mirena, you get effective contraception for up to 5 years and flexibility because you can have it removed by your healthcare provider whenever you want to try to have a child. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. In fact, within a year of having Mirena removed, approximately 8 out of 10 women succeeded at becoming pregnant.    What if I haven't decided whether or not I want more children?   Mirena may be a good choice for you because it continuously prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years. But Mirena is reversible. Should you decide you do want to try to become pregnant, Mirena
can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider. Or, if at the end of the 5 years you're still undecided, you can have another Mirena placed.    What happens if I become pregnant while using Mirena?   One risk of becoming pregnant while using Mirena is called ectopic pregnancy. This means that the pregnancy is not in the uterus. It may occur in the fallopian tubes. Signs of ectopic pregnancy may include unusual vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention and often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility and even death, so it is important to call your healthcare provider right away if you think that you're pregnant. There are also risks if you become pregnant while using Mirena and the pregnancy is in the uterus. Severe infection, miscarriage, premature delivery and even death can occur with pregnancies that continue with an intrauterine device (IUD). Because of this, your healthcare provider may try to remove Mirena, even though removing it may cause a miscarriage. If Mirena cannot be removed, talk with your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of continuing the pregnancy. If you continue your pregnancy, see your healthcare provider regularly. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs of infection. It is not known if Mirena can cause long-term effects on the fetus if it stays in place during a pregnancy.    Can Mirena protect me from HIV or STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)?   No. Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs. So, if while using Mirena you think you or your partner might be at risk of getting an STD, use a condom and call your healthcare provider.    Does Mirena contain any metal?   No, Mirena does not contain any metal. It is made of soft, flexible plastic.        Back to Top   Is Mirena right for me?   Who is Mirena right for?   Mirena is a hormone-releasing IUD (intrauterine device) placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy for as long as you want for up to 5 years. Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child. Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you . Mirena offers a flexible birth control option if:   You want birth control you don't have to think about taking every day  You had a baby and want to explore your birth control options. Click here for more information for new moms  You want to have more children in the future  You are happy with your family size the way it is  You are unsure if you want more children  You want birth control that is also approved to treat heavy periods   Start a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena may be right for you.      Who should not use Mirena?   Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you. As the two of you discuss your options, there are a number of things you should share—like your general health, current or past health conditions, sexual history and whether you'd like to have more children in the future. Mirena is not appropriate for women who:   Are or might be pregnant; Mirena cannot be used as an emergency contraceptive  Have had a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) unless you have had a normal pregnancy after the infection went away  Have an untreated pelvic infection now  Have had a serious pelvic infection in the past 3 months after a pregnancy  Can get infections easily. For example, if you have:  Multiple sexual partners or your partner has multiple sexual partners  Problems with your immune system  Intravenous drug abuse    Have or suspect you might have cancer of the uterus or cervix  Have bleeding from the vagina that has not been explained  Have liver disease or a liver tumor  Have breast cancer or any other cancer that is sensitive to progestin (a female hormone), now or in the past  Have an intrauterine device in your uterus already  Have a condition of the uterus that changes the shape of the uterine cavity, such as large fibroid tumors  Are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, polyethylene, silica, barium sulphate or iron oxide      What should I tell my healthcare provider when deciding if Mirena is right for me?   You should share any current or past health conditions that you have with your healthcare provider to help you both decide if Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) may be right for you. Your healthcare provider needs to know if you:   Have had a heart attack  Have had a stroke  Were born with heart disease or have problems with your heart valves  Have problems with blood clotting or take medicine to reduce clotting  Have high blood pressure  Recently had a baby or if you are breastfeeding  Have severe migraine headaches   What else should you discuss with your healthcare provider?     How do I get Mirena?   Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to understand if Mirena is a good option for you. If it is, then Mirena can usually be placed in your healthcare provider's office at your next visit.    Will my health insurance plan cover Mirena?   Learn how to check with your insurance company.    Why would I consider Mirena?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control that lasts as long as you want, for up to 5 years. Because it can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider, it's reversible and you're free to keep your family planning options open. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Patient Information .        Back to Top   How to get Mirena      Are there any potential serious complications with Mirena?   Some serious but uncommon side effects of Mirena include:  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Some IUD users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease. PID is usually sexually transmitted. You have a higher chance of getting PID if you or your partner have sex with other partners. PID can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic pain that does not go away. PID is usually treated with antibiotics. More serious cases of PID may require surgery. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is sometimes needed. In rare cases, infections that start as PID can even cause death.  Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of PID: long-lasting or heavy bleeding, unusual vaginal discharge, low abdominal (stomach area) pain, painful sex, chills, or fever.  A life-threatening infection called sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), may occur within the first few days after Mirena is placed. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe pain or unexplained fever shortly after Mirena is placed.  Perforation . Mirena may become attached to (embedded) or go through the wall of the uterus. This is called perforation. If this occurs, Mirena may no longer prevent pregnancy. If perforation occurs, Mirena may move outside the uterus and can cause internal scarring, infection or damage to other organs. Surgery may be needed to have Mirena removed. The risk of perforation is increased if Mirena is inserted while you are breastfeeding.      What are the more common side effects of Mirena?   Possible common side effects of Mirena include: Placement discomfort . Pain, bleeding or dizziness may occur during and after placement. This is common. Let your healthcare provider know if the cramping is severe. If your symptoms do not stop 30 minutes after placement, Mirena may not have been placed correctly. Your healthcare provider will examine you to see if Mirena needs to be replaced or removed.  Expulsion . Mirena may come out by itself and no longer prevent pregnancy. Symptoms of partial or complete expulsion may include bleeding, pain and an increase in menstrual flow. If this occurs, Mirena may be replaced within 7 days of a menstrual period after pregnancy has been ruled out. If you think that Mirena has come out, use a back-up form of birth control such as condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider.  Missed menstrual periods . About 20% of women stop having periods after 1 year of Mirena use. Your periods will return once Mirena is removed. If you do not have a period for 6 weeks during Mirena use, contact your healthcare provider to rule out pregnancy.  Changes in bleeding . You may have bleeding and spotting between menstrual periods, especially during the first 3 to 6 months. Sometimes the bleeding is heavier than usual at first. However, the bleeding usually becomes lighter than usual and may be irregular. Call your healthcare provider if the bleeding remains heavier than usual or increases after it has been light for a while.  Cysts on the ovary . About 12 out of 100 women using Mirena develop a cyst on the ovary. These cysts usually disappear on their own in a month or two. However, cysts can cause pain and may sometimes require surgery.  This is not a complete list of side effects with Mirena. For more information, ask your healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the manufacturer at 1-888-842-2937, or at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .     Will my partner be able to feel Mirena during intercourse?   You and your partner shouldn't feel Mirena during intercourse, because Mirena is placed in the uterus, not the vagina. Sometimes your partner feels the threads. If this occurs, talk to your healthcare provider.    Back to Top         Next: Safety               Close     Close     Close     Close               Back to Top             INDICATIONS FOR MIRENA  Mirena ® (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years. 
					Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception.      IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Mirena.  Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Mirena comes out, tell your healthcare provider (HCP). If Mirena comes out, use back-up birth control. Mirena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.  Pregnancy while using Mirena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.  Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.  Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.   Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs.  Only you and your HCP can decide if Mirena is right for you.  Mirena is available by prescription only.

How long does it take to get pregnant after removing IUD?   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Q: I removed my Mirena IUD two months ago. How long will it take to get pregnant? A: The mirena IUD (intrauterine device) is a hormone-releasing contraceptive that is placed in the uterus and delivers a small amount of hormone (progestin) directly to the uterus - this form of contraception needs to be placed by a healthcare provider and is effective for up to five years.  The mirena IUD is not only a very effective contraceptive but is also beneficial for the treatment of disorders such as abnormal uterine bleeding.  The IUD is placed within seven days of the start of the menstrual period and is 99% effective as a contraceptive.  A woman may try to conceive right after the IUD is removed. It takes the average young couple about 4-6 months to conceive and after one year approximately 85-90% of couples will conceive.

Scar tissue that develops around the coils prevents sperm from reaching the egg.     The Essure system is a type of permanent birth control for women. It cannot be reversed.  This type of female sterilization involves placing small metal and fiber coils in the fallopian tubes, which creates scar tissue that prevents sperm from reaching an egg. During the procedure, the doctor inserts a flexible tube with a small camera (hysteroscope) through the vagina and cervix and up to the uterus. From here, the doctor can see the opening to the fallopian tubes and place the Essure system coils into them.  It takes about three months for the Essure system to prevent pregnancy. In some women, it may take up to six months. During this time, you must use another form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Essure doesn't protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).      Why it's done The Essure system is a type of female sterilization. It's a permanent way to prevent pregnancy.  Benefits of using the Essure system include:   It works very well. The risk of pregnancy is about 0.1 percent when the coils are placed properly.  The procedure can be done in the doctor's office. Little or no anesthesia is needed.  You can return to daily activities the day of the procedure.  There's no incision or scarring of the skin.  After your doctor confirms the system is working and your tubes are blocked, you'll no longer need to buy contraception, other than products used to prevent STIs.  Most women report no long-term side effects.   The Essure system isn't right for everyone, however. Your health care provider may recommend other methods of contraception if:   You aren't sure whether or not you want to become pregnant in the future.  You have a metal allergy. The materials used in the inserts may contain traces of nickel or other metals. You may need allergy testing before the procedure.  You're allergic to the contrast (dye) used during follow-up imaging tests to confirm the procedure worked.  You have an autoimmune disease, which may trigger excessive inflammation around the coil inserts.  You've had a baby or an abortion within the past six weeks.  You have or recently had a pelvic infection.  A health condition of the uterus or fallopian tubes blocks the tube openings, which means the doctor can't properly place the Essure system.  You've had your tubes tied (tubal ligation).   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Risks Researchers continue to study the risks associated with or possibly linked to the Essure system. They may include:   Pelvic pain  Allergic reaction, including hives, itching and face swelling  Heavy periods or spotting during ovulation  Infection from the procedure  Perforation of the uterus or fallopian tubes  Shifting of the coils to other places in the abdominal cavity   Sometimes, the coils aren't placed properly or only one tube becomes blocked. This can result in unintended pregnancy. However, less than 1.5 out of 1,000 women get pregnant with the Essure system. When pregnancy occurs, it's usually because:   Pregnancy occurred before the procedure.  The coils weren't placed properly.  Back-up contraception wasn't used for three to six months following the procedure, or until the doctor confirmed tubal blockage.   If you do get pregnant after having the Essure procedure, there's a higher chance that it will be an ectopic pregnancy — when fertilization happens outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. Talk with your doctor right away if you have a positive pregnancy test after the Essure procedure.  After you have the Essure system implanted, you may not be able to have pelvic procedures involving electrosurgery, such as some types of endometrial ablation.  The Essure system doesn't offer protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  How you prepare Your health care provider will ask you why you are choosing sterilization and explain that the Essure system can't be reversed. You'll talk about the things that might cause you to later regret your decision, such as young age or an unstable relationship. Together, you'll review the risks and benefits of reversible versus permanent contraception.  Before your Essure system procedure, your health care provider will explain the following things:   Details of the procedure, including the best time to do it  Side effects and risks  Reasons why the procedure may fail  The need to use backup contraception for three months after the procedure, or until tubal blockage is confirmed  The risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and why and when your partner should use a condom   Your health care provider needs a clear view of your fallopian tube openings to insert the Essure system. For this reason, it's often best to do the procedure shortly after your period, when the lining of the uterus is thin. If you have irregular periods, your health care provider may recommend medication to thin this lining. Options include birth control pills, rings or patches that contain progestin (alone or with estrogen) or an injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera).  What you can expect    Essure placement Essure placement With the Essure system, your doctor implants metal coils in each fallopian tube. Eventually, scar tissue develops, blocking the tubes and preventing sperm from reaching the egg. No incision is necessary.     The procedure to insert the Essure system coils can be done in your health care provider's office. It typically takes 30 minutes or less. You may be given medication before the procedure to prevent pain and reduce spasm of your fallopian tubes, which can make insertion difficult.  During the procedure Your health care provider places the Essure system inside your fallopian tubes using a hysteroscope, a thin tube with a camera lens attached, as a guide. The scope passes through your vagina and cervix into your uterus, where it provides a view of the opening of each fallopian tube. If the opening to the tubes can be seen, the health care provider inserts the tiny Essure coils through a catheter attached to the scope and up inside each tube.  After the procedure You may go home immediately after the procedure and return to your normal activities the same day. The most common side effects after the procedure are:   Cramping  Abdominal pain  Nausea or vomiting   Contact your health care provider immediately if you have severe or persistent pelvic pain or a coil falls out.  You must use another form of contraception for three months after the procedure. Around this time, your health care provider will order X-rays or other imaging tests to confirm the coils are in the right position and the fallopian tubes are blocked. If the procedure is successful, you can stop using other forms of birth control at this point.  You should still have a period each month. The Essure system doesn't affect your monthly cycle. If you stop having periods or think you're pregnant at any time after the procedure, contact your health care provider immediately.  The Essure system cannot be reversed.

Pregnancy With an IUD: Is It Possible?  Becoming pregnant when you have an IUD isn't common, but it can happen. Find out the symptoms and implications of an IUD pregnancy. By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         wavebreakmedia/ Shutterstock.com  An intrauterine device, or IUD, is one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control -- and it's rare to become pregnant while using one. "The IUD has a 99.7 percent efficacy rate," says Lanalee Araba Sam, M.D., an ob-gyn in Ft. Lauderdale. "Very, very few women with one will become pregnant. But I always tell my patients that someone on this planet is that one-in-a-million exception. There are instances where someone becomes pregnant with an IUD in place." If you're concerned that that could be you, it's completely understandable, since about 25 percent of women stop having their period while on Mirena, a type of IUD that uses the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, says Cristina Perez, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Women's Specialists of Houston at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women. The other type of IUD, ParaGard, uses copper to prevent pregnancy. "ParaGard has no hormones," Dr. Perez explains, so if you're using it, you should still be getting your period as long as you're not pregnant. Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! Symptoms of an IUD pregnancy A pregnancy with an IUD in place typically has the same symptoms as any regular pregnancy -- including breast tenderness, nausea, and fatigue -- so if you're experiencing those symptoms and you have missed your period, call your doctor right away to find out if you're pregnant. It's important to catch such a pregnancy early. An at-home pregnancy test might not indicate a pregnancy as early as a blood test in the office would, so you'll want to be tested by a medical professional. Shop for at-home pregnancy tests IUD pregnancy risks Unfortunately, there are additional risks involved with an IUD pregnancy. "You're 50 percent more likely to miscarry if the IUD is left in place, so the recommendation is to let the pregnancy continue and remove the IUD," says Dr. Sam. But even then, Dr. Sam adds, you're 25 percent more likely to miscarry even if the IUD is removed. So your doctor will want to monitor an IUD pregnancy closely. There's also a higher risk of ectopic or tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies almost always end in loss of the pregnancy, and need to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage to the woman's reproductive system. If you are, in fact, pregnant, your doctor will likely test your blood once, and then again 48 hours later, to make sure the pregnancy hormone, hCG, steadily rises, so he can confirm that your pregnancy is progressing. If it does, it's not an ectopic pregnancy . Pregnancy after an IUD Although becoming pregnant with an IUD in place is rare, getting pregnant after having an IUD removed isn't. (That's good news if you want to conceive, and fair warning if you don't!) If you have decided to try to conceive, give your ob-gyn a call to have your IUD removed, and get busy trying. Some doctors recommend waiting three months after removal before you start trying to conceive, to give your body time to get back to its usual menstrual cycle. This helps you to understand when you're ovulating and most fertile. But according to Dr. Perez, there's no medical need to wait: "You can ovulate and get pregnant the next month!" Are You Pregnant?

Here, doctors explain why that's extremely unlikely (as are all other IUD complications). Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest George Mattei / Getty Images Sarah Brown is hoping to make the U.S. Olympic track team for the 1,500 meter run at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials today, just four months after giving birth . Brown didn’t plan to be pregnant while training for the Olympics, but her copper IUD failed…just as she was running her best race times ever. “I went from crushing workouts to, all of a sudden, in the second interval of a workout, I thought I was running in sand. Racing wasn’t fun anymore,” Brown, 29, told New York magazine’s The Cut . “It was really frustrating because we had concentrated so hard on doing things right, and I didn’t feel like I had overtrained. It was like, ‘Why is this happening? What’s wrong with me?’” Brown eventually took an at-home pregnancy test that was negative, but a few weeks later, she went to see her doctor who determined that she was, in fact, pregnant. Brown’s IUD was removed, and her daughter was born in March. Luckily, doctors say this is extremely rare. “IUDs are a very, very reliable method of birth control,” Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. There are a few different kinds of IUDs, all of which are implanted inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy and last anywhere from three to 10 years. Some contain progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It thickens cervical mucus, making it tougher for sperm to get to an egg. It also thins the uterine lining so that even if the sperm did reach an available egg, the fertilized egg would have a hard time implanting. Then there's the copper IUD, like the kind Brown used. Those work by causing an inflammatory reaction that harms sperm, says Mayo Clinic . At over 99 percent efficacy , IUDs are the real deal when it comes to preventing pregnancy. Jason James, M.D., medical director at Miami's FemCare Ob-Gyn , agrees, but he also notes that even the best birth control can fail. “There’s nothing that’s 100 percent,” he points out. It rarely ever happens, but Whelihan says there are a few ways IUDs can slip up. One is due to insertion error that goes undetected. Doctors recommend that anyone who gets an IUD comes back around a month later to make sure it's still nestled in the right place in the uterus. Whelihan estimates that more than half of people “don’t show up for that visit because they feel fine and it’s an inconvenience, but it’s important." If IUD moves from the upper cavity of the uterus into the lower segment, it won’t be as effective, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF. A person's body can also expel the IUD, meaning it can actually fall out, leaving them unprotected against pregnancy. And finally, people are more likely to get pregnant if their IUD expires, Shepherd says. If someone does get pregnant while using an IUD, they're at a greater risk of having an ectopic pregnancy (when the fetus develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes). “Overall, IUDs prevent pregnancy very well, and the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is lower than that of the general population,” James says. “But if [pregnancy while using an IUD] does occur, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is fairly significant.” Getting pregnant while using an IUD can also result in miscarriage . That’s why if someone suspects or discovers that they're pregnant even though they have an IUD, they need to call their doctor right away. Beyond pregnancy, other uncommon complications are possible with IUDs. Whelihan lists perforation of the uterus as one, which happens when the IUD punctures the wall of the uterus or even goes all the way through it. However, she stresses that it’s pretty rare and happens in only about one in 1,000 cases. There is also a risk of infection, James says, but again, it’s not nearly prevalent enough to be a major concern when deciding to get an IUD. Despite Brown’s situation, doctors stress that IUDs are an extremely safe and reliable way to avoid getting pregnant. “I love IUDs," Shepherd says. "They really are one of the best forms of birth control." Related: These Women Are Live-Tweeting Their Periods And We're Here For It Can Stress Actually Make It Harder To Get Pregnant?

How Can You Get Pregnant Using an IUD?  By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | May 5, 2017 05:33pm ET                            MORE               Credit: Image Point Fr/Shutterstock     A woman's photo of her newborn baby — just delivered, and with the intrauterine device (IUD) that failed to prevent her pregnancy clenched in his tiny fist — has gone viral. But how does a woman get pregnant while using an IUD?  The woman, Lucy Hellein of Fort Mitchell, Alabama, posted the photo of her newborn son to Facebook last week with the caption “Mirena fail!" according to Metro.co.uk . (The photo has since been removed, but not before it was shared tens of thousands of times on social media.) A surgeon discovered the IUD behind the placenta during the delivery, according to Metro. Hellein told Metro that this was her third Mirena IUD, which she had inserted last summer. But in December, she found out she was 18 weeks pregnant. Her doctors initially assumed the IUD had fallen out, but then it turned up during her C-section.  An IUD is a type of long-acting, reversible contraception that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. [ 11 Big Fat Pregnancy Myths ]  Pregnancy among women who have IUDs is very rare. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), IUDs are one of the most effective forms of birth control , with a failure rate of less than 1 percent during the first year of typical use. That's about the same rate as sterilization procedures such as "tube tying," ACOG said. According to Mirena, which makes a hormonal type of IUD, fewer than eight out of 1,000 women (0.8 percent) become pregnant over five years using the device.  Still, in rare cases, pregnancy can occur. For example, the IUD can slip partly or completely out of the uterus, which happens in about 5 percent of users during the first year, ACOG said. This is most likely to occur soon after the device is inserted, and if this happens, a woman can get pregnant. Mirena advises its users to check about once a month to see if the device is in the right place. Women can do this by feeling for the threads attached to the device that extend down from the uterus into the top of the vagina.  Less commonly, the IUD may move and become embedded in the uterus, and very rarely, the device may pierce the uterus. If this happens, the device also does not protect against pregnancy and must be removed, according to Medscape. [ Are You Pregnant? 10 Early Signs of Pregnancy ]  Some IUDs also do not necessarily protect against pregnancy as soon as they are inserted. IUDs made from copper start working right away, but hormonal IUDs protect against pregnancy right away only if they are inserted during the first seven days of a woman's period, according to Planned Parenthood. If a hormonal IUD is inserted at another time in a woman's cycle, it takes seven days before the device is effective, and women should use another type of birth control, such as condoms, during this time, Planned Parenthood says.  Women who do become pregnant while they have an IUD inserted face a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy , which occurs when an embryo implants outside of the uterus, according to Planned Parenthood. Up to half of pregnancies that occur with the Mirena IUD in place are likely to be ectopic, according to the company. In clinic trials with the device, 0.1 percent of users had an ectopic pregnancy in a single year, the company said.  If a woman becomes pregnant with an IUD and the pregnancy is inside the uterus, she has a risk of a severe infection, miscarriage and premature delivery, Mirena said. Because of this, doctors may try to remove an IUD if a woman becomes pregnant.  Hellein's son, Dexter Tyler, was born on April 27, weighing about 9 pounds. "Although he wasn't planned, my family and I feel incredibly blessed," Hellein told Metro.   Original article on Live Science .

The only thing I&#39;m scared about us that the dr could not find my Mirena so I&#39;m not sure if it came out by itself or if its in there somewhere. He did tell me that there is a chance the baby could abort because of it but then that he has delivered several babies whose moms still had the Mirena inside and it came out with the afterbirth. So I&#39;m praying that everything goes good and my baby is healthy. This would be my 4th child. We were shocked at first because we are not prepared for one more. But we are happy now!                 mmadrigal783    Answered 10/22/13               10 found this helpful     DIRECTLY FROM MIRENA'S WEBSITE:

Q:What if I become pregnant while using Mirena?

A: Unfortunately, no birth control method, including Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) or tubal ligation (getting your tubes tied), is 100% perfect. If you do get pregnant while using a birth control method, there may be risks to you and your baby. Here we talk about the risks of getting pregnant while Mirena is still in place.

Over the course of 5 years, fewer than 8 in 1,000 women become pregnant while using Mirena. One risk of getting pregnant while using Mirena is called ectopic pregnancy, when the pregnancy is not in the uterus. It may occur in the fallopian tubes. Signs of ectopic pregnancy may include unusual bleeding or abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention and often surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility and even death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you think that you're pregnant.

I&#39;m hoping that means that when I get my BFP that the real symptoms aren&#39;t actually that bad. PMS and early pregnancy symptoms are the same because they are caused by the same hormone - progesterone. During your 2ww, your body is preparing itself to be pregnant whether or not your cycle will end in a viable pregnancy. This is a just in case mechanism so that your body is prepared for any possible pregnancy. So your body does act as though it is pregnant for roughly two weeks out of every cycle in preparation. If you are indeed pregnant, those symptoms will lengthen and intensify. New ones will appear too as your pregnancy progresses and hCG accumulates. I&#39;d suggest you to read this book from http://pregnancyhours.com that can help you to get pregnant fast and have a healthy pregnancy. Guaranteed! I tried this too and it&#39;s worked.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/30/15               8 found this helpful     I just found out two days ago that I am pregnant. I&#39;ve been on mirena for a year and a half. Unfortunately the pregnancy is etopic so just yesterday, the day after I found out about the pregnancy, I had to be given a shot to terminate. I was about 4 weeks along.

Created with Sketch.                  Comment                 Photo: Suphat Bhandharangsri/Getty Images      A while back, I took my two young sons to the park. It was a beautiful late summer day, the clouds tatty and thin, like an unraveling of cotton candy. They ran and tackled each other in the grass. It was the kind of day where I let myself relax into feeling lucky.          Later, at home, I took a pregnancy test, the kind with two dark lines for positive. I remember taking those tests over and over, trying for our first. Squinting, willing a second line into existence. I am glad those days are over. I was taking the test because my breasts were hot and sore and my period was late. I was taking the test so I could stop that little worm of worry that kept getting into my throat. I have an IUD — there was only a slim chance. Such a wafer of a chance. And besides, my husband and I were done. We were past done. I was just starting to get myself back: I’d lost the baby weight and then some; I was writing again; my days weren’t filled with the carrying of children. Often, my arms were empty, and that felt like freedom.    Days with my children are both routine and freewheeling, bursting with creativity and mired in drudgery. Every moment feels untidy, unkempt, pre-defined, both beyond my control and demanding of it. My child complained that I was taking too long. I was rushing around my head, planning lunch and naps and maybe a brief, quiet window of writing. Then they bloomed before me, life emphatic, a yes to the question I never even wanted to ask.      Two dark lines.  No, was my immediate response.     My IUD was placed eight weeks after my second child was born. My oldest had hand, foot, and mouth; he was feverish and pleading in the waiting room, Let’s go, Mom. Let’s go home. But I did not want to risk getting pregnant again — the thought made me feel weak, ill. Power through, I told myself. Just power through. A cheerful midwife came in. I remember nothing she said. I do remember how terribly she hurt me when placing the IUD, because the IUD I had between the births of my sons hadn’t hurt nearly as much. I also remember how long it took for her to complete the procedure, and how desperately sad I felt looking at my oldest, red-faced and staring, powering through.    I’d made the requisite follow-up appointment to have the IUD placement checked. But I never went to that appointment, likely fearing the return of the sadness I felt in that white room, how out of my reach any semblance of control in my life felt.  At six weeks pregnant I was scheduled for an ultrasound so they could locate the IUD. It had migrated, and was now lodged in the rear right of my uterus, like Pooh stuck in Rabbit’s door. Two doctors, an ultrasound tech, and an ultrasound-tech-in-training stared at the screen, squinting and pointing and quibbling, while one of them held a probe inside my cervix, jabbing it here and there. “Oh, there’s the baby,” someone said, as the wand passed what looked like a blinking kidney bean. I barely made it to the car before the tears came, sloppily tumbling down my face and onto my coat. I called my husband and told him I wanted an abortion.  I didn’t have an abortion .    It’s hard to explain why I never went through with it. I realized I’d never truly faced what I would do if I were ever put in the position of an unwanted pregnancy. Each time I had been pregnant before, it was because I had wanted to be; the yearning for a child was so real that it was painful. Now, unwillingly pregnant at age 37, I had no idea if I was capable of either option: another baby, or ridding myself of a pregnancy. Each option felt equally terrifying.    I went to the internet, craving a sign at the very least, a definitive answer at most. What I found was surprising: of the information on abortion, most was targeted to or written by single, childless women who wanted to remain that way. I could not find any useful information about married mothers who are done having babies. It felt, and it feels, like an anomaly. Like the universe is saying, What’s one more child?  Or, What are you, a monster?  Because I could not decide, I didn’t decide. I wept and I raged. I allowed myself the rare moments of excitement. I went to my second doctor’s appointment. At some point, as I listened to my doctor describe the minutiae of blood tests and ultrasounds, she stopped herself. Maybe she saw something in my face.  “I’m sorry. I’m assuming you want to continue with this pregnancy. Is that a safe assumption?”  And I began sobbing.  She let me cry, and she explained my options. My in-network hospital would not perform abortions, so I’d need to be referred to another one. (Writing this from a more stable place, I would like to say fuck that hospital.) I could take a series of pills that would stop the production of progesterone and cause a miscarriage up until nine or ten weeks; if I chose to end the pregnancy after that it would be a surgical procedure. I was still crying, worrying the tissue she’d handed me into wilted confetti. The doctor asked me, quietly, had I experienced depression after my last two births?    Yes.  Had I ever had suicidal thoughts?  Yes.  There it was, the truth: I hadn’t healed from the birth of my second son, nearly two years prior, and I hadn’t healed from the birth of my first, almost five years ago. My trauma was right there; I was coated in it, a ghosty afterbirth that I could ignore but never wash off. She handed me a card for a therapist, hugged me, and told me everything would be okay. No matter what I chose.       I wish I could say my decision hit me like a lightning bolt, or a glowy miracle, or a loud, twinkly epiphany. I wish I could say my feelings about it are more clear, now that I’ve veered onto the keep-it fork in the road. I wish I could explain how I even got here. I can’t. I believe all women should have the right to choose, and that they should be supported before, during, and after. I believe abortion should be safe and legal, and I cheer for all the women who exercise their right to choose, and I ache for them. Life is hard either way.  If I could distill my decision down, it would be this: I need help. I need a lot of help. I will stop pretending that I don’t. I let that doctor hug me, and I hugged her back. I find myself in deep conversations with other women, strangers sometimes, about motherhood and abortion and how nothing is simple . I search their words for light, and the light always comes.  About a month ago, I found out I was having a girl. I had long ago made my peace with not having a daughter , though I used to long for one. “You said ‘a girl,’ right?” I asked the woman on the phone. And then I cried. They are leaving the IUD in because it is too risky to remove it. They hope it comes out with the birth but if not, there will need to be a surgical procedure. The presence of the IUD can cause preterm labor; it has perforated my uterus and that might cause an infection. This is my second “geriatric pregnancy,” so there will be a lot of extra monitoring. Still, she perseveres. Her heartbeat is strong; she kicks her legs in defiance of the ultrasounds. I feel the fury of her flutters.  In my first pregnancy, when I found out I was having a boy, my mother told me she was glad. That boys are special, chosen. I think of that, and I think of this girl, this “determined little nugget,” as a friend called her, and how she ignited upon landing, how she lit everything up, how she seems to have chosen me . Maybe I can’t explain how I got here because it wasn’t ever my decision. Life emphatic, a girl I welcome and fear. Not that she’s asking.

More than 99% effective  Works for up to 10 years  ‘Fit and forget’ contraception – you don’t need to do anything  There are two types: one with hormones, one without hormones  Your period might change. There might be more or less bleeding   This page explains the IUD, and tells you how to get one.  WHAT IS AN INTRA UTERINE DEVICE (IUD)?  An IUD is a small, T-shaped object that goes inside your uterus.  There are two types of IUDs:   Copper IUD - contains copper, a type of metal  Hormonal IUD – contains the hormone progestogen (Mirena or Jaydess)   The IUD is put in your uterus by an experienced nurse or doctor. This is simple and safe and takes about 5 to 10 minutes.  You can’t feel it or tell it is there except by checking for the strings. Your partner should not be able to feel it. You can still use tampons.  The removal strings come out of your cervix and curl up inside the top of your vagina – they don’t hang outside.  HOW DOES IT WORK?  The hormones or the copper stop the sperm reaching the egg. Sometimes, sperm does reach the egg (fertilisation) so the IUD stops the egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus.  HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?  Copper and hormonal IUDs are at least 99% effective. Only 1 in 100 people will get pregnant each year.  HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?  The copper IUD is free if you are a New Zealand resident. If you want a copper IUD, you need two appointments - one to check if it’s the right choice for you, and another to have it put in. If you are under 22, appointments are free.  The hormonal IUD comes with an extra cost .  WHAT WILL I NOTICE?  Some people might notice some changes to their period, while others might not.  With a copper IUD, your periods might be longer, heavier and more painful, especially in the first few months. This usually gets better with time.  With a hormonal IUD (Mirena or Jaydess), you might have spotting in the first few months and then light or no periods.  CAN I GET PREGNANT AFTER THE IUD IS TAKEN OUT?  Yes, you will be able to get pregnant as soon as the IUD is taken out.  Pregnancy is very rare with the IUD. If you do get pregnant with an IUD in, there is no extra risk for your baby. You will need to have the IUD taken out during pregnancy.  WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES?   Long acting – it lasts for up to 10 years  Reversible – you can choose to have it taken out at any time. After that, you will be able to get pregnant again  99% effective – it works very well  You don’t need to think about contraception every day  Does not affect breastfeeding  Does not get in the way of sex  The copper IUD does not contain any hormones  The copper IUD can also be used as emergency contraception  The hormonal IUD has a very small amount of hormones and most people have no side effects from this  The Mirena (a hormonal IUD) can help with period bleeding and pain, and most will have light bleeding or no periods at all.   Studies show that IUDs do NOT cause pimples, headaches, sore breasts, nausea, mood changes, loss of sex drive or weight gain. There is no evidence of an extra risk of cancer.  WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES?   Some people feel pain, cramps or dizziness when the IUD is put in or taken out.   There are some risks from having an IUD put in:   There is a small risk of infection (about 1%) when an IUD is put in  There is a very small risk of damage to the uterus (about 1 in 1000 people)  A copper IUD might give you more bleeding and cramping during your period, but this usually gets better over time  The copper IUD can cause an allergic reaction, but this is very rare  The hormonal IUD might give you irregular or light bleeding  The IUD can sometimes come out by itself (about 5% of all IUDs). You can check the strings are still in the right place at any time.   WHO CAN GET AN IUD?  Most people can use an IUD, including those who are young and those who have not had children.  Hormonal IUDs are a really good option if you have heavy periods.  If you have an infection, you should get it treated before you get an IUD put in.  If you have heavy or painful periods you should not get a copper IUD because it might make them worse.  WHEN CAN I GET AN IUD?  An IUD can be put in at any time you choose. You must not already be pregnant.  Some good times to get it put in are:   While you have your period or just after  6 weeks after your baby is born  At the time of a surgical abortion  As emergency contraception after unprotected sex (copper IUD).   DOES IT PROTECT ME FROM STIS?  No. You need to use condoms and lubricant to protect yourself from sexually transmissible infections (STIs). If there is a chance you may have an STI, have a check-up.  HOW DO I GET AN IUD?   Make an appointment at Family Planning .  At your first appointment, the nurse will ask you some questions about yourself and your health to check that the IUD is the right choice for you. They’ll explain what you need to know about having an IUD. They might also suggest you have an STI test.  Read the “Getting your IUD” page so you feel ready for your next appointment. If you have any questions, write them down to ask the nurse.  At your second appointment, the nurse will put the IUD in.

After a photo of a baby holding the IUD that was supposed to prevent it went viral, we asked an expert to explain how the hell that happens. SHARE TWEET Gabby Bess May 5 2017, 8:49pm Thank God for birth control. Modern medicine has given women have the ability to choose when they become pregnant, and the IUD in particular has made it simpler than ever to control our reproductive system. If you can endure some of its annoying side effects , all you have to do is pop that sucker in and forget about it for up to 10 years. With yesterday's House vote to repeal the ACA and many of its protections for women's health, it may be more important than ever to have this longterm solution. But as we all witnessed in horror when a new mom's Instagram of her baby holding her failed IUD went viral, there is a possibility that the birth control method can be unsuccessful at preventing pregnancy. According to reports , Lucy Hellein gave birth to a nine-pound, one-ounce boy on April 27, even though she had a Mirena IUD—which works by releasing a low level of levonorgestrel into the uterine system—inserted last year. To capture the irony, she placed the IUD in her newborn's hand for a photo after it was removed from her placenta. She captioned the image, "Mirena fail!"

Reading her story, I was shocked, too. I don't want this to happen to me! Going through several different disaster scenarios in my mind, I also started to wonder: What do I do if it does? "All methods of contraception have a failure rate ," Dr. Colleen Krajewski, a consultant at Bedsider , a non-profit birth control support network operated by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , reminded me to calm me down. But a "Mirena fail!" is rare. "To use rough estimates, about one out of four women using condoms become pregnant, about one in ten women using birth control pills become pregnant, and about two in 1000 become pregnant on Mirena," she said. "In other words, if a car full of women were all using condoms as their only contraception, one is likely to become pregnant; one woman out of an elevator full of women using pills; and one out of a concert hall full of women using IUDs." The fact that IUD pregnancies are so rare is part of why they're shocking to hear about, Dr. Krajewski adds. But in Hellein's case, her IUD was still inside of her when she gave birth, which is the part that disturbed me the most. Her doctor thought it had fallen out since it didn't show up on her initial ultrasound, but it hadn't. What's up with that? "In the very, very, very rare event that a woman becomes pregnant with an IUD in place, on the ultrasound the IUD often appears 'displaced'—and in fact it is—by the pregnancy," Dr. Krajewski explained. "When a pregnancy is growing in a uterus, the IUD moves. It's hard to say which came first." Dr. Krajewski says it's not harmful to your health to have an IUD and a pregnancy at the same time. If you decide to remain pregnant, it's not harmful for the fetus, either. "The hormone in Mirena is progesterone. It's not harmful to a pregnancy," she said. "In fact, your body produces high levels of progesterone in pregnancy—it's 'pro-gestational.'" It can be hard to tell when you've missed a period when you have an IUD since Mirena lightens menstruation. Hellien says she didn't know until she was 18 weeks , when she went to the doctor. "This delay can be very scary for patients to think about, which is understandable," Dr. Krajewski says. So if you're paranoid about the small risk and are definitely not interested in carrying a pregnancy, she recommends that you "use the money saved on tampons and pads to buy a few tests to keep at home for peace of mind."

So if you're sexually active and looking for birth control that provides the greatest peace of mind, an IUD is probably your best bet.  An IUD is a T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a physician. Hormonal IUDs release progesterone, and copper IUDs release copper. Both substances kill sperm and make the uterine lining uninhabitable to fertilized eggs. A hormonal IUD can prevent pregnancy for up to five years, and a copper one works for up to 10 years. While this form of birth control is highly effective, its success in preventing pregnancy is dependent on whether the device stays in place correctly. To help ensure correct placement, the IUD has a string that hangs out through the cervix into the vagina so that the woman can occasionally check. Physicians usually recommend that a woman have regular checkups with her gynecologist to monitor the IUD. It is especially important to have an IUD examined four to six weeks after it is first inserted.            Just because IUDs are highly effective doesn't mean there's no chance you can get pregnant while using them -- although there are differing opinions on which of the two types of IUDs (hormonal and copper) is most effective.  Some research has suggested there's a 2 percent risk of getting pregnant with a hormonal IUD and an.8 percent risk of conceiving with a copper IUD [source: Palo Alto Medical Foundation ]. Those figures, of course, reflect typical use. If the devices are used perfectly, this same research shows that the risk of pregnancy with a hormonal IUD is reduced to 1.5 percent risk, and that of a copper IUD goes down to.6 percent [source: Palo Alto Medical Foundation ]. However, other studies show that the chances of getting pregnant from a hormonal IUD are 2 in 1,000; whereas the odds with a copper IUD are 6 in 1,000 [source: WebMD ].  If you do get pregnant while using an IUD, it can increase your odds of a miscarriage or difficult pregnancy. Complications can include pre-term delivery, vaginal bleeding, clinical chorioamnioitis and placental abruption [source: Kim, et. al ].  Ectopic pregnancy has also been associated with IUD use. (An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fetus begins developing somewhere outside the uterus, such as a fallopian tube.) It isn't that IUD use leads to ectopic pregnancy so much as it increases the risk of a fertilized egg developing elsewhere because conception in the uterus has been blocked [source: Daiter ]. In general, copper IUDs are less likely to lead to ectopic pregnancy than progesterone IUDs [source: Daiter ].

Understanding Mirena     What is Mirena?   Mirena is an intrauterine device (also known as an IUD) that releases small amounts of the hormone levonorgestrel locally into your uterus. Made of soft, flexible plastic, Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider during an office visit. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child.  Mirena offers contraception that's over 99% effective; in fact, it is one of the most effective methods of reversible birth control  Mirena prevents pregnancy for as long as you want, for up to 5 years  You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed by your healthcare provider. In fact, about 8 out of 10 women succeed at becoming pregnant within 1 year of having Mirena removed            Is Mirena FDA-approved?   Mirena was approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 2000 for intrauterine contraception and in 2009 to treat heavy periods for women who choose intrauterine contraception. Discuss all safety considerations with your healthcare provider and use Mirena according to the Prescribing Information . No birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena is right for you.         What is Mirena made of?   Mirena is made of soft, flexible plastic and contains the hormone levonorgestrel. See what Mirena looks like      How does Mirena work to prevent pregnancy?   Mirena prevents pregnancy, most likely in several ways:  Thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from entering your uterus  Inhibiting sperm from reaching or fertilizing your egg  Thinning the lining of your uterus      While there's no single explanation for how Mirena works, most likely these actions work together to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years.          What about hormones and Mirena?   Mirena contains a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel that is often used in birth control pills. Because Mirena releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Mirena does not contain estrogen.        Are there any placement-related complications?   Mirena may attach to or go through the wall of the uterus and cause other problems. If Mirena comes out, use backup birth control like condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider. Some women may experience cramping or pain, bleeding and/or dizziness during and after Mirena is placed. Tell your healthcare provider if your cramps are severe. If your symptoms last for more than 30 minutes, let your healthcare provider know. Mirena may not have been properly placed and your healthcare provider should examine you.    How effective is Mirena at preventing pregnancy?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Unfortunately, no birth control method, including Mirena, is 100% perfect. Once Mirena is placed by your healthcare provider, it is over 99% effective and works continuously to prevent pregnancy. So you don't have to think about taking birth control every day or even every year. You just do a self-check of the threads of Mirena once a month to make sure it's in place. Be sure to ask your healthcare provider to explain how. If you have trouble finding the threads, or can't feel the threads, call your healthcare provider. And in the meantime, be sure to use a backup form of non-hormonal birth control. It is important to think about your daily, weekly and monthly routine and how that may affect which birth control method is best for you. The chart below shows the chance of becoming pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. The most effective methods, including intrauterine devices such as Mirena, are found at the top of the chart. If you have any questions about this information, please ask your healthcare provider. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Safety Considerations and the Patient Information.         How can Mirena help with family planning decisions?   With Mirena, you get effective contraception for up to 5 years and flexibility because you can have it removed by your healthcare provider whenever you want to try to have a child. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. In fact, within a year of having Mirena removed, approximately 8 out of 10 women succeeded at becoming pregnant.    What if I haven't decided whether or not I want more children?   Mirena may be a good choice for you because it continuously prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years. But Mirena is reversible. Should you decide you do want to try to become pregnant, Mirena
can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider. Or, if at the end of the 5 years you're still undecided, you can have another Mirena placed.    What happens if I become pregnant while using Mirena?   One risk of becoming pregnant while using Mirena is called ectopic pregnancy. This means that the pregnancy is not in the uterus. It may occur in the fallopian tubes. Signs of ectopic pregnancy may include unusual vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention and often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility and even death, so it is important to call your healthcare provider right away if you think that you're pregnant. There are also risks if you become pregnant while using Mirena and the pregnancy is in the uterus. Severe infection, miscarriage, premature delivery and even death can occur with pregnancies that continue with an intrauterine device (IUD). Because of this, your healthcare provider may try to remove Mirena, even though removing it may cause a miscarriage. If Mirena cannot be removed, talk with your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of continuing the pregnancy. If you continue your pregnancy, see your healthcare provider regularly. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs of infection. It is not known if Mirena can cause long-term effects on the fetus if it stays in place during a pregnancy.    Can Mirena protect me from HIV or STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)?   No. Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs. So, if while using Mirena you think you or your partner might be at risk of getting an STD, use a condom and call your healthcare provider.    Does Mirena contain any metal?   No, Mirena does not contain any metal. It is made of soft, flexible plastic.        Back to Top   Is Mirena right for me?   Who is Mirena right for?   Mirena is a hormone-releasing IUD (intrauterine device) placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy for as long as you want for up to 5 years. Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception. Mirena can be used whether or not you have had a child. Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you . Mirena offers a flexible birth control option if:   You want birth control you don't have to think about taking every day  You had a baby and want to explore your birth control options. Click here for more information for new moms  You want to have more children in the future  You are happy with your family size the way it is  You are unsure if you want more children  You want birth control that is also approved to treat heavy periods   Start a conversation with your healthcare provider to find out if Mirena may be right for you.      Who should not use Mirena?   Only you and your healthcare provider can decide if Mirena is right for you. As the two of you discuss your options, there are a number of things you should share—like your general health, current or past health conditions, sexual history and whether you'd like to have more children in the future. Mirena is not appropriate for women who:   Are or might be pregnant; Mirena cannot be used as an emergency contraceptive  Have had a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) unless you have had a normal pregnancy after the infection went away  Have an untreated pelvic infection now  Have had a serious pelvic infection in the past 3 months after a pregnancy  Can get infections easily. For example, if you have:  Multiple sexual partners or your partner has multiple sexual partners  Problems with your immune system  Intravenous drug abuse    Have or suspect you might have cancer of the uterus or cervix  Have bleeding from the vagina that has not been explained  Have liver disease or a liver tumor  Have breast cancer or any other cancer that is sensitive to progestin (a female hormone), now or in the past  Have an intrauterine device in your uterus already  Have a condition of the uterus that changes the shape of the uterine cavity, such as large fibroid tumors  Are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, polyethylene, silica, barium sulphate or iron oxide      What should I tell my healthcare provider when deciding if Mirena is right for me?   You should share any current or past health conditions that you have with your healthcare provider to help you both decide if Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) may be right for you. Your healthcare provider needs to know if you:   Have had a heart attack  Have had a stroke  Were born with heart disease or have problems with your heart valves  Have problems with blood clotting or take medicine to reduce clotting  Have high blood pressure  Recently had a baby or if you are breastfeeding  Have severe migraine headaches   What else should you discuss with your healthcare provider?     How do I get Mirena?   Have a conversation with your healthcare provider to understand if Mirena is a good option for you. If it is, then Mirena can usually be placed in your healthcare provider's office at your next visit.    Will my health insurance plan cover Mirena?   Learn how to check with your insurance company.    Why would I consider Mirena?   Mirena is one of the most effective forms of birth control that lasts as long as you want, for up to 5 years. Because it can be removed at any time by your healthcare provider, it's reversible and you're free to keep your family planning options open. You can try to become pregnant as soon as Mirena is removed. No one method of birth control is right for everyone and there are risks associated with Mirena that you should know about. For detailed information about possible side effects, some potentially serious, please see Mirena Patient Information .        Back to Top   How to get Mirena      Are there any potential serious complications with Mirena?   Some serious but uncommon side effects of Mirena include:  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Some IUD users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease. PID is usually sexually transmitted. You have a higher chance of getting PID if you or your partner have sex with other partners. PID can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic pain that does not go away. PID is usually treated with antibiotics. More serious cases of PID may require surgery. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is sometimes needed. In rare cases, infections that start as PID can even cause death.  Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of PID: long-lasting or heavy bleeding, unusual vaginal discharge, low abdominal (stomach area) pain, painful sex, chills, or fever.  A life-threatening infection called sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), may occur within the first few days after Mirena is placed. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe pain or unexplained fever shortly after Mirena is placed.  Perforation . Mirena may become attached to (embedded) or go through the wall of the uterus. This is called perforation. If this occurs, Mirena may no longer prevent pregnancy. If perforation occurs, Mirena may move outside the uterus and can cause internal scarring, infection or damage to other organs. Surgery may be needed to have Mirena removed. The risk of perforation is increased if Mirena is inserted while you are breastfeeding.      What are the more common side effects of Mirena?   Possible common side effects of Mirena include: Placement discomfort . Pain, bleeding or dizziness may occur during and after placement. This is common. Let your healthcare provider know if the cramping is severe. If your symptoms do not stop 30 minutes after placement, Mirena may not have been placed correctly. Your healthcare provider will examine you to see if Mirena needs to be replaced or removed.  Expulsion . Mirena may come out by itself and no longer prevent pregnancy. Symptoms of partial or complete expulsion may include bleeding, pain and an increase in menstrual flow. If this occurs, Mirena may be replaced within 7 days of a menstrual period after pregnancy has been ruled out. If you think that Mirena has come out, use a back-up form of birth control such as condoms and spermicide and call your healthcare provider.  Missed menstrual periods . About 20% of women stop having periods after 1 year of Mirena use. Your periods will return once Mirena is removed. If you do not have a period for 6 weeks during Mirena use, contact your healthcare provider to rule out pregnancy.  Changes in bleeding . You may have bleeding and spotting between menstrual periods, especially during the first 3 to 6 months. Sometimes the bleeding is heavier than usual at first. However, the bleeding usually becomes lighter than usual and may be irregular. Call your healthcare provider if the bleeding remains heavier than usual or increases after it has been light for a while.  Cysts on the ovary . About 12 out of 100 women using Mirena develop a cyst on the ovary. These cysts usually disappear on their own in a month or two. However, cysts can cause pain and may sometimes require surgery.  This is not a complete list of side effects with Mirena. For more information, ask your healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the manufacturer at 1-888-842-2937, or at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .     Will my partner be able to feel Mirena during intercourse?   You and your partner shouldn't feel Mirena during intercourse, because Mirena is placed in the uterus, not the vagina. Sometimes your partner feels the threads. If this occurs, talk to your healthcare provider.

					Mirena also treats heavy periods in women who choose intrauterine contraception.      IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Mirena.  Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Mirena comes out, tell your healthcare provider (HCP). If Mirena comes out, use back-up birth control. Mirena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.  Pregnancy while using Mirena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.  Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.  Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.   Mirena does not protect against HIV or STDs.  Only you and your HCP can decide if Mirena is right for you.  Mirena is available by prescription only.
