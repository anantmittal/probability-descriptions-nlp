Matthew Reynolds   Guides Editor  @Crazyreyn       Shiny Pokémon were first introduced in March 2017 with the surprise reveal of Shiny Magikarp and its evolution, the red Shiny Gyarados .  More recent months have seen the reveal of new shinies, including Shiny Pikachu , with more unique variants over time.  Shinies are notoriously rare, as any veteran of the main series will gladly tell you, so what do we know about Pokémon Go Shinies , and how do you catch them?  Shiny Magikarp, Shiny Gyarados, how to find Shiny Pokémon and which Shinies are available in Pokémon Go? The first Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon Go were Magikarp and Gyarados, in a callback to what was, for most players, the first Shiny they ever caught: the Red Gyarados at Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal's Lake of Rage. Normal (left) vs Shiny (right). Credit reddit user skinnysnorlaz They're found by simply trying to catch Pokémon and seeing if they display as an alternate colour in the battle and post-battle screens - they won't appear as a different colour in the field, so you have to attempt to catch them first. A Shiny creature is extremely rare, so it's simply a case of checking every one you are looking for - such as Magikarp - in the hope it will be a different colour. Often, the variation is somewhat subtle. You can see the difference in Magikarp in this comparison image, courtesy of Silph Road subreddit user skinnysnorlaz , and the evolution into a Red Gyarados below:        Subscribe to our YouTube channel    Shiny Pikachu and other shinies in Pokémon Go Around five months after Shiny Magikarp was first sighted, we started to see the first sign of other shinies. Though the list has expanded greatly since the arrival of Magikarp and Red Gyarados, the number is small compared to the number of non-shiny creatures in the game.

Shiny Pikachu: August 2017's Pokémon Go Park event in Japan revealed the second set of Shinies. Those within the event radius had a chance of catching a Shiny Pikachu, which much like the Red Gyarados, could also be evolved into a shiny Raichu. These have since been made available around the world, and was expanded on with a shiny hatted Pikachu as part of the 2018 Pokémon Day .

The main games had shinies for every single creature, so there's a chance every one in Pokémon Go will offer them at some point, but it makes sense Niantic would want to drip feed them for special occasions and make them more of an event.

We cover everything you need to know about the new Research quests feature, as well as the Kanto Week event , which will help you unlock Mew in Pokémon Go , and we've also got some advice on where to find Ghost-type Pokémon if you're having trouble.

Ever-expanding Pokédex completionists, meanwhile, might want to read about the various Special Items available as well as the various methods for determining Eevee evolutions .    Other things to know about Pokémon Go Shinies - independent Shinies, Shiny Ditto and more  Aside the from the basics, there are a few other important points to note about Shiny Pokémon and the way they operate:   Shiny Pokémon are independent - in other words, two people can go to the same place and catch the same Magikarp, which has the same stats and IVs, but they won't necessarily both be Shiny. This is generally seen as a good thing by the community: it means people won't all be rushing to the same place after a Shiny is spotted, and 'spoofers' who cheat the system to change their location won't be able to instantly grab a Shiny as soon as one is located.  Ditto pretending to be Shiny Pokémon aren't Shiny themselves - that's right, if you find yourself a rare Shiny Magikarp and it suddenly transforms into a Ditto, the Ditto itself won't be Shiny. If you do suffer such incredibly bad luck, it might be worth holding onto it though, just in case that Ditto is retrospectively changed to Shiny once the game is updated to include Shiny variants for all Pokémon.  Shiny Pokémon's evolutions will be Shiny too - the good news, at least, is that Shiny Pokémon will evolve into Shiny Pokémon. So that means a gold Magikarp will turn into a red Gyarados when evolved, and so on. Another reason to hold onto those Candies for any Pokémon you encounter!  Shinies have their own entries in the Pokédex - Once you have found a Shiny, visit that creature in the Pokédex and you can view its unique appearance, alongside any gender differences. The following image by Dronpes explains this in closer detail:     Credit: reddit user Dronpes    Shiny Pokémon show up as standard colour Pokémon on the map - they only reveal themselves as Shiny once you start the battle sequence with them, which means checking every Pokémon you see now if you want to find Shinies, even if you've already caught plenty of that Pokémon!  There's a new warning if you try to transfer a Shiny - if you try and send a Shiny to Professor Willow, you'll get an additional pop-up warning checking that you definitely want to transfer this Shiny Pokémon. A nice touch to stop any fat finger issues!   That's all the important info you need - the rest of it is down to good old fashioned luck, so it's time get searching!

Chaining is a technique used in the main games where encountering the same pokemon repeatedly increased the chance of a shiny pokemon encounter. Make sure you only enter in combat with magikarp for a while and to capture them.     share | improve this answer      edited Jun 12 '17 at 11:50             answered Jun 12 '17 at 11:23       Chocobouc   478 1 10                  Your links are borderline spam, bouncing them through google to get to that site. – Frank  Jun 12 '17 at 11:40            @Frank, thanks for pointing it out, I was browsing those link through amp.

Niantic      Pokemon GO      While getting a Pokémon with a “special” move that can just be evolved away isn’t exactly a huge draw during Pokémon GO Community Day, what is a big deal the boosted chance for a shiny that we saw in the inaugural event recently.  Naturally, the Silph Road wanted to dig up some data on the shiny spawns , and after a lot of collection, they’re ready to declare just how much your chance is boosted to get a shiny on Community Day above normal days.  For Pikachu, the shiny rate is about 1 in 22.7 catches, on average. No less than 1 in 19, no more than 1 in 28, which is the range. So for roughly every 20-25 Pikachu you caught during that event (and they were everywhere ) one of them should have been shiny.    What Silph Road does not do is compare this to past data. What’s the normal rate of a shiny showing up?  Previously, we have:   Shiny Sableye, which was about 1 in 263 encounters  Shiny Magikarp, whichw was about 1 in 235 encounters   Both of those may sound like low odds, but keep in mind when shinies were introduced in the handheld games, it was more like 1 in every 4-8,000 catches would give you one.      Niantic      Pokemon GO      And the end result is that Community Day effectively gives you not only a 10x greater chance to catch a shiny version of a Pokémon, but it’s practically a guarantee with enough catches, given that these Pokémon are spawning in droves at a rate like nothing else in the game for those few hours. The point is that you will never have a better chance to catch a shiny version of that Pokémon than you will during the Community Day window.  It has yet to be confirmed that when Dratini arrives in February for Community Day that he’ll have a shiny variant appearing as well (as of right now, he doesn’t, while Pikachu did), but that’s the running theory. The idea is that players may not be tempted by the “unique move” (which really, is a gimmick, and not useful), but instead be lured by the shiny spawns (also not useful, but who doesn’t want a shiny collection?). So I would bet that yes, we definitely will see shiny Dratinis that can be evolved into shiny Dragonairs and Dragonites.  Niantic may continue to expand Community Day as time goes on, but for now, definitely get out there and get yourself some easy shinies. You’ll never have a better chance, most likely.

How do You Find Shiny Pokémon  Want a shiny Pokémon, but aren’t sure where to start? We help you out!   Guide by USgamer Team , 12/20/2017 .      In Pokémon Gold and Silver, the original games that brought Gen 2 to the world of Pokémon, you encounter an angry Gyarados that's causing a ruckus at the Lake of Rage. It was at this time that the majority of Pokémon fans got to see their first shiny Pokemon , as when the battle between you and the Gyarados started, a sparkle animation played and the Gyarados appeared red, not blue. Shiny Pokemon were finally added to Pokemon GO with the Water Festival event, which started on March 22, 2017. In this Pokemon Go guide we'll tell you how to find shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go .  If you're keen to learn more about Pokemon Go but already know all there is to know about shiny Pokemon , head on over to our Pokemon Go Guide hub . It's full of relaly useful information to help you become a great Pokemon trainer.  How do I find a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go?  There's one little caveat - as of the time of writing, there are only two shiny Pokemon available in the game . These are Magikarp and Gyarados, a little surprise from Niantic in honour of the red Gyarados in the Lake of Rage.  As for finding them, the process is no different from catching regular Pokemon; you simply tap the Pokemon and attempt to catch it. You might expect the model of the Pokemon would appear differently before you enter battle, but shinies appear just like regular Pokemon up until when you engage them. If you see a red Magikarp flopping about on the map, tap it! It might happen to be a shiny.  Is Catching a Shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go That Simple?  That's it! Of course, similarly to the main series of games, it's not quite as easy as tapping on a few of them. While the odds of finding a shiny Pokemon don't appear to be as high as the 1 in 8192 odds of old, initial findings put the number at somewhere around the 1 in 350 mark. It could also be possible that the shiny odds were raised for the event, but as Niantic haven't publicly mentioned what the shiny odds are, it's hard to say.       Can me and a friend catch the same shiny?  Unfortunately not. The game decides whether a Pokemon is shiny when you tap on it, giving you that estimated 1 in 350 chance. Because of that, it's extremely unlikely that you would both find a shiny on the same Pokemon, as each of your games would need to roll the dice and beat the odds. Just don't boast too much if you catch a shiny and they don't!  What do shiny Pokemon do in Pokemon Go?  They shine! There's no difference between a regular Pokemon and a shiny Pokemon aside from its appearance. There's no bonus to IVs, no power boost and nothing else that could differentiate it from a regular version. They are more of a bragging right or a collectible, but there are some fantastic color variants that'll soon be out in the wild. Until then, it's just the gold Magikarp and the red Gyarados.

With 1765 (and counting) people contributing to this research I think we can say that the sample size is large enough. I first considered using sampling with replacement to generate a larger dataset, but I think it doesn't give better results. I can do it afterwards, but I don't think it is necessary.  The results are:    No Plus  With Plus  Total     143  79  222    36564  21880  58444    Which leads to a 1 in 255.7 for no Go Plus users, 1 in 278.0 for Go Plus users and 1 in 263.3 if we combine both groups. As already mentioned in some of the comments, I agree that 1 in 256 seems to be the real shiny rate. This is a slightly lower rate than the results give. However, I assume that people which have caught only a few Sableye without shinies are less likely to participate in the survey compared to those that have caught a shiny.  For those wondering why the rates are lower for Go Plus users: when Go Plussing a Sableye, it won't show up shiny in your journal. Since Go Plussing has a lower chance of catching the shiny Pokemon (due to berries, different ball etc.), they seem to have a lower rate. Stated differently: many shiny Sableye have been Go Plussed away. Slide remark: there have also been caught shinies which wouldn't have been encountered if the Go Plus wasn't used.  I've also calculated some more statistics based on the participants. I have to note that the first 100 entries of the first survey form aren't in these numbers. So far 11.7% (195 entries) of the contributors has caught at least one shiny. 33.1% of the contributors have used a Go Plus during the event. And there is one lucky person with 3 shinies out of 151 Sableye (no go plus).  If anyone is interested in the results file or in a specific fact of the results you can contact me or ask below.  Edit: For those interested in even more datapoints, sadly enough troll time has started... 27/3, 5000/1009, 42/30, 7/1, 17/1, 23/1, 16/1, 17/1 etc. are coming in within a few minutes. Can somebody please explain the fun of that?
Edit2: I deleted around 100 datapoints in which the troll was active. Which leaves me now with 2158 responses in the dataset. I've now closed the form. These are the final results:    No Plus  With Plus  Total     187  98  285    46986  26174  73160    The rate now is 1 on 251.  Furthermore, I've done some sampling with replacement of all 1383 NO Go Plus entries (bootstrap). I took 10,000 different samples of size 10,000. The mean rate of these sample is 1 in 250.4 and leads to the following histogram: http://i67.tinypic.com/212sw8k.png  I'm really starting to think that 1 in 250 might be the real rate instead of 1 in 256..., although in practice it won't really matter.  Edit3: I'm saying 1 in 250 or 256 is the rate. An even larger bootstrapped sample size came to this plot with a mean of 1 in 250.3: http://i63.tinypic.com/p99wy.png   119 comments share save hide report all 119 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

I know the research department has been (long) at work trying to study the magikarp rates. I'd be surprised if they come up with something that isn't at least really close to what you've found here.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Gav_Star level 40  43 points 44 points 45 points  5 months ago  (21 children) From memory the 1 in 250 karp for shiny was during event, after that it dropped to 1 in 500, I expect Sableye to follow.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] cy0t3 lvl 40 mystic  15 points 16 points 17 points  5 months ago  (14 children) It took me 801 Karp to find my shiny; to which I caught almost 500 during the event. After shiny pika was released, my 13th Pichu hatch was a 96% shiny; so I can’t complain there. Unfortunately, I’m 111 sableye in, and nothing. Whereas my friend got it on his first Sableye. He thought something was up when the next one was purple lol   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] I-Roll-Spikes-Gear Bama  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (1 child) How many of those come before it was released though? I have encountered around ~1000 Magikarp and have 1 shiny, but I have only probably caught 3-400 since they released the shiny.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] cy0t3 lvl 40 mystic  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 months ago  (0 children) That’s the accurate #  Whenever a shiny has been added to the game, I screenshot the Pokédex entry to be able to gauge the statistics. I had 272 magikarp encountered prior to the release of Shiny Magikarp. The shiny catch was encounter 1073, and I’m currently at 1210.  The only error I made through the first shiny experience in this game was that I didn’t screenshot/log how many magikarp I had encountered by the end of the water event.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] likes2debate  -1 points 0 points 1 point  5 months ago  (10 children) I know someone who got one on their second try, didn't realize it was shiny, and it jumped out and fled.  There sure seem to be a lot of people who caught one in their first 5. I swear there is something up with that.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] MisirterE Melbourne, Victoria  8 points 9 points 10 points  5 months ago  (4 children) How do you not realize the magikarp you are catching is a completely different primary colour   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] likes2debate  5 points 6 points 7 points  5 months ago  (0 children) It was a Sableye and they questioned their memory, since they had only seen one before. "Hey, I thought these were purple, weren't they?" It wasn't until they went to catch their third that they were all, "uh-oh."   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] brianga  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 months ago  (2 children) I'm colorblind and am pretty sure I'd miss it.

A lot of the "first 5" were really first 7-8 or more. Second, if I went out and caught one right off the bat during an event I'd be excited and post it. The person who catches one next month won't. But if you catch one in your first try but not another in the next 500 the odds are still the same as the guy who catches one as 501.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] StoicThePariah Central Michigan, Level 39  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (1 child)  A lot of the "first 5" were really first 7-8 or more.   It's pretty easily proven by the number of candies in their screenshots, unless they deliberately run from non-shinies.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Sids1188 Queensland  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) Well I guess they could just catch the shiny, then power up their other sableyes until they run out of candy and take the screenshot after that.  That said, I got my own shiny on the second catch, so I don't see it as unbelievable that others did the same.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] likes2debate  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) People are posting their screenshots and they have 50-something candy so they are probably not exaggerating. That might just be a local anomaly. But yeah, there are massive reporting biases here.   Most people have very few of them. So if they did get a shiny, it will be in the first few.  Only people who actually get one report it.  Many people will stop trying after getting one.    permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] mdbfsfw South Florida  21 points 22 points 23 points  5 months ago  (0 children) There's been spotty analysis at best for strictly post-event rates, but I haven't seen clear evidence that the rate was any different during and after the event. I think it's a myth.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Antcats 37 | 250/251 | LI-NY  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (2 children) Did the rate drop even further after the Halloween event started?

For global events I am not sure what the spawn rates are supposed to be or if they are increased at all and I suspect they are not.

Therefore there are probably more shinies in numbers, but not in rates.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] oinkartltd 6.5K+ KM WALKED (on foot)  7 points 8 points 9 points  5 months ago  (0 children) It appears many players can get dozens of karps at right waterfront location in a matter of hours.

Apparently, if I did my math correctly... if you find 256 Sableyes, and you have a 1/256 chance (0.39% chance per encounter), that puts you at a 64% chance of finding one in your first 256 encounters.

Friends who play more than me have more than one, however   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] arthurmauk London Lv38 Instinct  7 points 8 points 9 points  5 months ago  (1 child) My guess is that during this event, shiny percentage is 1/256, and then afterwards it'll go to 1/512. I suspect the same thing happened with Magikarp during the Water Event.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Shipoffools1  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 months ago  (0 children) Yes this only an expected value and nothing is guaranteed. The distribution is memoryless (in poketerms, there is no chaining) so the chance of getting a shiny on the first catch is the exact same as getting one on the 250th catch. After enough catches however it's going to average out that you get one shiny at some point in every 250 catches   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] ShitsNGigglesdTB  13 points 14 points 15 points  5 months ago  (0 children) Nice thanks  At least working with this theoretical number it helps me to feel like I'm at least working towards something  Good work again   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Xsemyde  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 months ago  (2 children) do they not show shiny in the journal? i thought they did... does that mean that u couldve technically had a shiny karp/chu ran due to go+? i thought the journal did show it.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] JurianPEC Netherlands [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 months ago  (1 child) See: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/63zosi/in_case_you_were_wondering_shiny_magikarp_can/   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] lumpur02 Louisiana - Valor TL 40  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) The post in your link is 6 months old.  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/78zgdv/since_people_keep_asking_shiny_sableye_is_still/?ref=share&ref_source=link   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Chosticks Netherlands  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 months ago  (0 children) You did a great job dude!

Feeling pretty lucky!   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Sids1188 Queensland  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (5 children) A couple of things that raised my eyebrow here:   As already mentioned in some of the comments, I agree that 1 in 256 seems to be the real shiny rate. This is a slightly lower rate than the results give. However, I assume that people which have caught only a few Sableye without shinies are less likely to participate in the survey compared to those that have caught a shiny.   If that explanation were correct, it would mean that your data should be showing better odds than the actual (because the addition of the missing 0%s would bring it down to the real number). You've gone the other way.  Also, the way your data set goes, it heavily favours non-plus results (since there is twice as much data there). I would argue that a lot more weight should be put on the plus. It should be finding and catching them indiscriminately, which would remove the bias of people putting in more effort to catch the shinies than other sableyes.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] JurianPEC Netherlands [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (4 children) What do you mean with the 0%s? I don't understand your reasoning.  Furthermore, why would I have to put more weight on the plus? Using the Go Plus is only skewing the shiny rate since not all shiny Sableye will be observed as shiny.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Sids1188 Queensland  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (3 children) The people that you are assuming will not put in results are the ones with 0 shiny out of X sableye. So they have 0% of catches as shiny. If those were hypothetically added in to make the data more complete, the %age would decrease (or if you invert to express it as "1 out of Y", Y will increase).  I'm not clear on whether you took your data from the amount seen or the amount caught. If the former, then the go+ data won't be great, but you would also have people in the other set that didn't notice it was shiny at the time or lost count, so either way it will have problems.  If you went by caught, the people without a go+ will be heavily skewed as their catch rate will be much higher for shiny than non-shiny (as they will use berries and ultra balls). Here is where the go+ is best. It will have the same catch rate no matter what. You might not know how many shinies were missed, but it should be proportionally the same as the amount of non-shinies missed, so it won't affect the rate. In a large sample, shiny rate that is caught will be the same as the shiny rate that was found. Since you won't fail to notice shinies when they are in your inventory, it makes for a much more objective sample set.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] JurianPEC Netherlands [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (2 children) First statement is true, that's what I mentioned.  The data is from amount seen so I'll ignore the last paragraph. What you state that the go+ data isn't great, that's exactly why I've ignored all Go+ data in the further analysis. I assume the amount of people on this subreddit which do not recognize a shiny sableye is neglectible. The total amount of shinies seen can be seen in the pokedex, as was mentioned in the survey and I guess everybody can count to 3 (the most shiny Sableye found).   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Sids1188 Queensland  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (1 child) Its actually the opposite of what you said. You're explanation detailed why the data should overestimate the actual shiny%. You use that to justify an expectation that the real value is even higher than what the data showed (1 in 256 is a higher %age than 1 in 263).  If you're going with seen data then I suppose the non-plus will be better. Using caught data with the plus would have been a better data set, but I guess that can't be helped now.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] JurianPEC Netherlands [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) Ah I understand the miscommunication, I was talking about the 1 in 255.7 rate for non go+ users there.  Furthermore I don't agree with your last sentence, since only 33% used a Go Plus. On top of that most of them will probably have used both the Go+ and have caught manually. There is no way to find out which part has been caught with Go+ and which part has been caught manually. The percentage of users which only use a Go+ is that marginal that it is impossible to create a large enough sample size.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] compoundbreak791 LVL 39 - Cleveland  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) Makes sense. It wasn't until after 200 encounters with magikarp that I caught a golden.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Caitsith31 France  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) So no shiny rate boost during event then.

They're only fun if you're into collecting. They've got no special attributes, no guarantee of good IVs or moves or level...they just look a little different.  There are so few shinies available in the game right now that any of them are exciting (and they get disproportionately more discussion time because there are so few). Currently, it's limited to magikarp/gyarados, the pikachu family (though not during the event) and sableye.  Since the karp line is old news and the pikas aren't in the event. the shiny sableye is getting all the attention right now.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Wylde2228 Toledo, OH  17 points 18 points 19 points  5 months ago  (1 child) This is also the first time a shiny has been released at the same time as the base version. Meaning that seen/caught stats are easily tracked, unlike previous shinies where some people had 100's-1000's of magikarp/pikachu seen before the shiny version was released.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] mdbfsfw South Florida  10 points 11 points 12 points  5 months ago  (0 children) That's a good point.

Using certain methods like chain fishing drastically increase odds in the 3ds games and given the fact that you can actually direct your grinding towards a particular Pokemon I would say it is actually easier in many ways than in Go.  This would depend on which game you are talking about though and also which Pokemon you are after since not every method works for every Pokemon.  If you compare to Gold/Silver for example though, then yes it many times easier to get one in Go.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] mdbfsfw South Florida  4 points 5 points 6 points  5 months ago  (0 children) I actually had a whole bit in there about how they were much rarer in the core games, but figured it was just going to muddy the waters so I took it out.

That essentially means, say, if your user ID's last 8 bit is the same as the Pokemon's ID's last 8-bit, that means it is a shiny.  As an example, that means, in hexadecimal, if your userID is 0x63282E37, and the Sebleye's ID is also ending in 37, then that means it is a shiny.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Grimey_Rick Miami, FL - Lvl 40  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) I've seen this tossed around as a theory as to where the selection comes from in Go. is there any way to prove it though?   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] BaaZaaRi  -1 points 0 points 1 point  5 months ago  (2 children) Regarding the troll numbers.

The catch rate using a Go Plus is lower, but the results are all of caught mons so that doesn't matter. If the mon runs and is not caught by go plus, it should not be included in the results.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] et_tu_brutalisk  4 points 5 points 6 points  5 months ago  (3 children) The rate is the number of shiny seen vs total seen of the pokemon, but PoGO+ users won't have any way to know if a +'d pokemon that runs away is shiny.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Apsis  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 months ago *  (1 child) Someone using plus exclusively should count shinies caught/total caught. It doesn't matter if a shiny ran away, because you're not counting any of them. Call them Schrödinger shinies.  Obviously, a non plus user should know if a shiny ran, and would probably be using berries, so they should count total seen.  If only some captures are done with the plus, the player would have to keep track of manual encounters, and add them separately.  The survey doesn't make this clear, which could explain the upward skew for plus users.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] JurianPEC Netherlands [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 months ago  (0 children) I guess the amount of users which only use a Go Plus and do no regular catches is very small. Therefore, almost all Go Plus users would be in the last group you mention. I guess nobody of those has exactly denoted how many Sableyes were caught with and without Go Plus.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Which was disappointing, if you think about it. I thought that it was just coincidence and that it can be confirmation bias. But earlier when I finally decided to do a shiny hunt on swablu my "A" account got a shiny swablu on it's 8th encounter while my "B" account is already on it's 40th encounter and still has not got one. Now, you might say this doesn't prove anything but know that I also got a shiny aron on my "A" account on it's 15th - 20th encounter while my "B" account got it's shiny on its 130th+ encounter.  additional info: I'm chaining on both accounts, which means I don't check other mons other than the pokemon I'm hunting. I also don't check gyms and spin stops.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] tanyanubin  -1 points 0 points 1 point  1 month ago  (0 children) I caught 2 within half an hour at my local park in NJ- I evolved one 😀   permalink embed save report give gold reply about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Matthew Reynolds   Guides Editor  @Crazyreyn       Shiny Pokémon were first introduced in March 2017 with the surprise reveal of Shiny Magikarp and its evolution, the red Shiny Gyarados .  More recent months have seen the reveal of new shinies, including Shiny Pikachu , with more unique variants over time.  Shinies are notoriously rare, as any veteran of the main series will gladly tell you, so what do we know about Pokémon Go Shinies , and how do you catch them?  Shiny Magikarp, Shiny Gyarados, how to find Shiny Pokémon and which Shinies are available in Pokémon Go? The first Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon Go were Magikarp and Gyarados, in a callback to what was, for most players, the first Shiny they ever caught: the Red Gyarados at Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal's Lake of Rage. Normal (left) vs Shiny (right). Credit reddit user skinnysnorlaz They're found by simply trying to catch Pokémon and seeing if they display as an alternate colour in the battle and post-battle screens - they won't appear as a different colour in the field, so you have to attempt to catch them first. A Shiny creature is extremely rare, so it's simply a case of checking every one you are looking for - such as Magikarp - in the hope it will be a different colour. Often, the variation is somewhat subtle.

Though the list has expanded greatly since the arrival of Magikarp and Red Gyarados, the number is small compared to the number of non-shiny creatures in the game. At a glance, here is every possible shiny creature you can get in the game (excluding the recently added Dratini family) courtesy of Bubbatriston on The Silph Road subreddit : Credit Bubbatriston on The Silph Road subreddit. Shiny Pikachu: August 2017's Pokémon Go Park event in Japan revealed the second set of Shinies. Those within the event radius had a chance of catching a Shiny Pikachu, which much like the Red Gyarados, could also be evolved into a shiny Raichu. These have since been made available around the world, and was expanded on with a shiny hatted Pikachu as part of the 2018 Pokémon Day .

The main games had shinies for every single creature, so there's a chance every one in Pokémon Go will offer them at some point, but it makes sense Niantic would want to drip feed them for special occasions and make them more of an event.

We cover everything you need to know about the new Research quests feature, as well as the Kanto Week event , which will help you unlock Mew in Pokémon Go , and we've also got some advice on where to find Ghost-type Pokémon if you're having trouble. Other current events include April's Community Day , while you can finish off your Gen 3 Pokémon collection, and learn how the new creatures changed 2km, 5km and 10km Egg charts , region exclusives , Buddy distances and Shinies . Ever-expanding Pokédex completionists, meanwhile, might want to read about the various Special Items available as well as the various methods for determining Eevee evolutions .    Other things to know about Pokémon Go Shinies - independent Shinies, Shiny Ditto and more  Aside the from the basics, there are a few other important points to note about Shiny Pokémon and the way they operate:   Shiny Pokémon are independent - in other words, two people can go to the same place and catch the same Magikarp, which has the same stats and IVs, but they won't necessarily both be Shiny. This is generally seen as a good thing by the community: it means people won't all be rushing to the same place after a Shiny is spotted, and 'spoofers' who cheat the system to change their location won't be able to instantly grab a Shiny as soon as one is located.  Ditto pretending to be Shiny Pokémon aren't Shiny themselves - that's right, if you find yourself a rare Shiny Magikarp and it suddenly transforms into a Ditto, the Ditto itself won't be Shiny. If you do suffer such incredibly bad luck, it might be worth holding onto it though, just in case that Ditto is retrospectively changed to Shiny once the game is updated to include Shiny variants for all Pokémon.  Shiny Pokémon's evolutions will be Shiny too - the good news, at least, is that Shiny Pokémon will evolve into Shiny Pokémon. So that means a gold Magikarp will turn into a red Gyarados when evolved, and so on. Another reason to hold onto those Candies for any Pokémon you encounter!  Shinies have their own entries in the Pokédex - Once you have found a Shiny, visit that creature in the Pokédex and you can view its unique appearance, alongside any gender differences. The following image by Dronpes explains this in closer detail:     Credit: reddit user Dronpes    Shiny Pokémon show up as standard colour Pokémon on the map - they only reveal themselves as Shiny once you start the battle sequence with them, which means checking every Pokémon you see now if you want to find Shinies, even if you've already caught plenty of that Pokémon!  There's a new warning if you try to transfer a Shiny - if you try and send a Shiny to Professor Willow, you'll get an additional pop-up warning checking that you definitely want to transfer this Shiny Pokémon. A nice touch to stop any fat finger issues!   That's all the important info you need - the rest of it is down to good old fashioned luck, so it's time get searching!

Chaining is a technique used in the main games where encountering the same pokemon repeatedly increased the chance of a shiny pokemon encounter. Make sure you only enter in combat with magikarp for a while and to capture them.     share | improve this answer      edited Jun 12 '17 at 11:50             answered Jun 12 '17 at 11:23       Chocobouc   478 1 10                  Your links are borderline spam, bouncing them through google to get to that site. – Frank  Jun 12 '17 at 11:40            @Frank, thanks for pointing it out, I was browsing those link through amp.

Naturally, the Silph Road wanted to dig up some data on the shiny spawns , and after a lot of collection, they’re ready to declare just how much your chance is boosted to get a shiny on Community Day above normal days.  For Pikachu, the shiny rate is about 1 in 22.7 catches, on average. No less than 1 in 19, no more than 1 in 28, which is the range. So for roughly every 20-25 Pikachu you caught during that event (and they were everywhere ) one of them should have been shiny.    What Silph Road does not do is compare this to past data. What’s the normal rate of a shiny showing up?  Previously, we have:   Shiny Sableye, which was about 1 in 263 encounters  Shiny Magikarp, whichw was about 1 in 235 encounters   Both of those may sound like low odds, but keep in mind when shinies were introduced in the handheld games, it was more like 1 in every 4-8,000 catches would give you one.      Niantic      Pokemon GO      And the end result is that Community Day effectively gives you not only a 10x greater chance to catch a shiny version of a Pokémon, but it’s practically a guarantee with enough catches, given that these Pokémon are spawning in droves at a rate like nothing else in the game for those few hours. The point is that you will never have a better chance to catch a shiny version of that Pokémon than you will during the Community Day window.  It has yet to be confirmed that when Dratini arrives in February for Community Day that he’ll have a shiny variant appearing as well (as of right now, he doesn’t, while Pikachu did), but that’s the running theory. The idea is that players may not be tempted by the “unique move” (which really, is a gimmick, and not useful), but instead be lured by the shiny spawns (also not useful, but who doesn’t want a shiny collection?). So I would bet that yes, we definitely will see shiny Dratinis that can be evolved into shiny Dragonairs and Dragonites.  Niantic may continue to expand Community Day as time goes on, but for now, definitely get out there and get yourself some easy shinies. You’ll never have a better chance, most likely.

How do You Find Shiny Pokémon  Want a shiny Pokémon, but aren’t sure where to start? We help you out!   Guide by USgamer Team , 12/20/2017 .      In Pokémon Gold and Silver, the original games that brought Gen 2 to the world of Pokémon, you encounter an angry Gyarados that's causing a ruckus at the Lake of Rage. It was at this time that the majority of Pokémon fans got to see their first shiny Pokemon , as when the battle between you and the Gyarados started, a sparkle animation played and the Gyarados appeared red, not blue. Shiny Pokemon were finally added to Pokemon GO with the Water Festival event, which started on March 22, 2017. In this Pokemon Go guide we'll tell you how to find shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go .  If you're keen to learn more about Pokemon Go but already know all there is to know about shiny Pokemon , head on over to our Pokemon Go Guide hub . It's full of relaly useful information to help you become a great Pokemon trainer.  How do I find a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go?  There's one little caveat - as of the time of writing, there are only two shiny Pokemon available in the game . These are Magikarp and Gyarados, a little surprise from Niantic in honour of the red Gyarados in the Lake of Rage.  As for finding them, the process is no different from catching regular Pokemon; you simply tap the Pokemon and attempt to catch it. You might expect the model of the Pokemon would appear differently before you enter battle, but shinies appear just like regular Pokemon up until when you engage them. If you see a red Magikarp flopping about on the map, tap it! It might happen to be a shiny.  Is Catching a Shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go That Simple?  That's it! Of course, similarly to the main series of games, it's not quite as easy as tapping on a few of them. While the odds of finding a shiny Pokemon don't appear to be as high as the 1 in 8192 odds of old, initial findings put the number at somewhere around the 1 in 350 mark. It could also be possible that the shiny odds were raised for the event, but as Niantic haven't publicly mentioned what the shiny odds are, it's hard to say.       Can me and a friend catch the same shiny?  Unfortunately not. The game decides whether a Pokemon is shiny when you tap on it, giving you that estimated 1 in 350 chance. Because of that, it's extremely unlikely that you would both find a shiny on the same Pokemon, as each of your games would need to roll the dice and beat the odds. Just don't boast too much if you catch a shiny and they don't!  What do shiny Pokemon do in Pokemon Go?  They shine! There's no difference between a regular Pokemon and a shiny Pokemon aside from its appearance. There's no bonus to IVs, no power boost and nothing else that could differentiate it from a regular version. They are more of a bragging right or a collectible, but there are some fantastic color variants that'll soon be out in the wild. Until then, it's just the gold Magikarp and the red Gyarados.
