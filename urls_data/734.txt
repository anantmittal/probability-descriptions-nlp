In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

Reproduction (or making a baby) is a simple and natural experience for most couples. However, for some couples it is very difficult to conceive.  A man’s fertility generally relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm. If the number of sperm a man ejaculates is low or if the sperm are of a poor quality, it will be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for him to cause a pregnancy.  Male infertility is diagnosed when, after testing both partners, reproductive problems have been found in the male.  How common is male infertility?  Infertility is a widespread problem. For about one in five infertile couples the problem lies solely in the male partner.  It is estimated that one in 20 men has some kind of fertility problem with low numbers of sperm in his ejaculate. However, only about one in every 100 men has no sperm in his ejaculate.  What are the symptoms of male infertility?  In most cases, there are no obvious signs of infertility. Intercourse, erections and ejaculation will usually happen without difficulty. The quantity and appearance of the ejaculated semen generally appears normal to the naked eye.  Medical tests are needed to find out if a man is infertile.  What causes male infertility?  Male infertility is usually caused by problems that affect either sperm production or sperm transport. Through medical testing, the doctor may be able to find the cause of the problem.  About two-thirds of infertile men have a problem with making sperm in the testes. Either low numbers of sperm are made and/or the sperm that are made do not work properly.  Sperm transport problems are found in about one in every five infertile men, including men who have had a vasectomy but now wish to have more children. Blockages (often referred to as obstructions) in the tubes leading sperm away from the testes to the penis can cause a complete lack of sperm in the ejaculated semen.  Other less common causes of infertility include: sexual problems that affect whether semen is able to enter the woman’s vagina for fertilisation to take place (one in 100 infertile couples); low levels of hormones made in the pituitary gland that act on the testes (one in 100 infertile men); and sperm antibodies (found in one in 16 infertile men). In most men sperm antibodies will not affect the chance of a pregnancy but in some men sperm antibodies reduce fertility.  Known causes of male infertility     Sperm production problems • Chromosomal or genetic causes • Undescended testes (failure of the testes to descend at birth) • Infections • Torsion (twisting of the testis in scrotum) • Varicocele (varicose veins of the testes) • Medicines and chemicals • Radiation damage • Unknown cause    Blockage of sperm transport • Infections • Prostate-related problems • Absence of vas deferens • Vasectomy    Sexual problems (erection and ejaculation problems) • Retrograde and premature ejaculation • Failure of ejaculation • Erectile dysfunction • Infrequent intercourse • Spinal cord injury • Prostate surgery • Damage to nerves • Some medicines    Hormonal problems • Pituitary tumours • Congenital lack of LH/FSH (pituitary problem from birth) • Anabolic (androgenic) steroid abuse    Sperm antibodies • Vasectomy • Injury or infection in the epididymis • Unknown cause      The male reproductive system  The male reproductive system is made up of the testes, a system of ducts (tubes) and other glands that open into the ducts. The brain plays an important part in the control of the male reproductive system.  A side view showing the main parts of the male reproductive system  The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain, control the production of male hormones and sperm. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are the two important messenger hormones made by the pituitary gland that act on the testes.  Two messenger hormones act on the testes  The testes (testis: singular) are a pair of egg-shaped glands that sit in the scrotum next to the base of the penis on the outside of the body. The testes make sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. It takes about 70 days for sperm to become mature and able to fertilise an egg.  When released from the testes, the sperm spend two to 10 days passing through the epididymis where they gain the vital ability to swim strongly (become ‘motile’), and to attach to and penetrate (get into) the egg.  At orgasm, waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm, with a small amount of fluid, from the testes through to the vas deferens. The seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. This mixture of sperm and fluid (the semen) travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is ejaculated (released).     Diagnosis  How is male infertility diagnosed?  If a couple has been trying for a pregnancy without success, they should go to their local doctor, family planning clinic or women’s health clinic, and have some initial tests. Both partners should be tested, even if one has a child from another relationship. Diagnosis can involve a medical history from the man and a physical examination along with a semen analysis to check the number, shape and movement of sperm in the ejaculate.  Blood tests may also be done to check the levels of hormones that control sperm production. Genetic investigations and testicular biopsies are sometimes done.    Treatment  How is male infertility treated?  One in eight infertile men has a treatable condition, and after treatment, couples can become pregnant naturally.  In some cases, the doctor will recommend that the couple seek assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as IVF (in vitro fertilisation). ART do not cure or treat the cause of infertility but they can help couples achieve a pregnancy, even if the man’s sperm count is very low.  What is ICSI?  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a form of IVF where a single sperm is placed directly into each egg by piercing the outer covering of the egg. ICSI is particularly helpful for men with poor sperm production. Sperm are collected from the semen or removed carefully from the testis or epididymis.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)  ICSI can achieve pregnancies even when only a few sperm are produced.  As for IVF, after fertilisation the resulting embryos are then placed into the woman’s uterus.    Management & support  Can I do anything to prevent male infertility?  It is best to avoid cigarette smoking, excess alcohol, sexually transmitted infections, heat stress from tight fitting underwear, and anabolic steroids (taken for body building or sporting purposes) as these factors can be harmful to the production of sperm.  If you work in an occupation that may affect your fertility, it’s important to wear protective clothing and follow all occupational health and safety guidelines. It is recommended that couples trying to conceive avoid exposure to any possibly harmful chemicals.  Because of the possible effects on fertility, it’s important to tell your doctor if you have had hormone treatment or had surgery as a child to move your testes into the scrotum.  Can older age cause male fertility problems?  Healthy men in their 70s and beyond can still father children, however the time taken for a partner to become pregnant is longer when a man is middle-aged or older. Reasons for this may include a decrease in sexual activity, lower semen volume, changes to sperm motility (movement), a lower number of motile sperm, and possibly lower sperm function and DNA quality.  The chance of the child having some genetic or chromosomal problem is also increased for older men.  What emotions might a man experience when diagnosed with infertility?  Men may be shocked when they find out they are infertile. There is still a common but incorrect belief that infertility is a woman’s problem. Therefore, when men are told there is a sperm problem, they are often unprepared.  Being told that there is a sperm problem can affect a man’s sense of masculinity, sexuality and potency. Most infertile men at some time struggle with the idea that they are not able to do what other men can.  An emotional response to infertility is normal. Talking with a doctor or a sexual therapist or counsellor can help some men with their feelings about infertility.

By Catherine Guthrie   Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: July 2017     If you and your devoted are dancing around the idea of having a baby, odds are you're keeping track of your biological clock. Sure, you know how your age comes into play, but what about the candles on his birthday cake? Should you also be factoring his years into the equation? With 60-somethings like Billy Joel and Jeff Goldblum expanding their broods, it's easy to dismiss your guy's age. But you shouldn't shrug it off completely, says Harry Fisch, a urologist and director of the male reproductive center at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. A leading male fertility expert, Fisch literally wrote the book on the subject: The Male Biological Clock: The Startling News About Aging, Sexuality, and Fertility in Men . BabyCenter sat down with him to find out what you need to know about the fertility of your other half.  What's the biggest myth about men and fertility? The biggest misconception is that men age and nothing changes. Men feel that no matter what they do, everything will be the same. That's just not true. Men's fertility does decline with age. In a study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility , researchers interviewed nearly 2,000 women to find out how long it took them to conceive. Among women 35 and older, those whose male partners were 45 and older took five times longer to conceive than those whose partners were 25 and younger. The researchers also looked at what happens when young women (age 25 and under) have children with men 45 and older. The researchers found a fourfold increase in the time it took couples to conceive – meaning the man's age was a factor independent of the woman's age.  How do men's and women's biological clocks differ? They are distinctly different. A woman's egg supply is set before birth, declines dramatically even before she's out of the womb, and by the time she reaches menopause, most of her eggs are gone. In addition to that, a woman's left not just with fewer and fewer eggs as she ages, but with a higher concentration of abnormal ones. On the other hand, a man produces sperm throughout his life. He experiences a slight decline in fertility as he gets older, but his semen doesn't lose its concentration. So, for men there's no age limit when it comes to fathering children, which is why it's not unusual to see older men with young kids. But for women, age plays a huge factor in the ability to get pregnant.  How are men's and women's biological clocks similar? As a woman ages, there's a decline in her body's production of the female hormone estrogen, a decline in fertility , and a higher risk that her baby will have genetic problems. As men get older they see a decline in the male hormone testosterone, a decline in fertility, and a greater chance of fathering children with genetic problems. So just because he can make sperm doesn't mean it's high-quality sperm. As men age, the volume, motility (speed), and quality of their sperm decline. A number of years ago, the journal Fertility & Sterility published one of the largest reviews of male fertility to date. The authors found that between the ages of 30 and 50, the average man's sperm declines by up to 30 percent in volume, swims up to 37 percent slower, and is five times more likely to be misshapen. Shape is important because it correlates with the sperm's genetic content. A higher number of misshapen sperm equals a greater potential for genetic abnormalities.  Are genetic problems linked to older men? Some genetic abnormalities, like dwarfism, have long been associated with paternal age, but we didn't give these problems much scientific attention because they're relatively rare. In recent years, clinical trials have found links between the father's age and more common genetically related conditions, such as Down syndrome and schizophrenia. Overall, the risk is highest when both parents are over 35. Since the number of births to parents older than 35 has more than doubled in the past two decades, this is a valid concern. A study published in the Journal of Urology found that the rate of Down syndrome births doubled among women ages 35 to 39 if their partner was also over age 35. (However, if a woman is 35 or older, odds are she's going to have an amniocentesis or CVS , either of which would detect Down syndrome.) Paternal-age risk factors aren't really an issue for women 35 and under because the ovaries have a built-in mechanism that repairs damaged DNA delivered by the sperm. But that safety net starts to break down after she turns 35.  Should older men be allowed to donate sperm? On the evidence that sperm from older men is more likely to have genetic abnormalities, some European countries have prohibited men from becoming sperm donors after they reach a certain age. But I think that as long as a man has well-shaped sperm and a good sperm count, he should be entitled to donate sperm. That said, it becomes harder and harder to meet those criteria as you get older. And even putting age aside, it's very difficult to qualify as a sperm donor. Only 5 percent of men who apply to become donors are accepted because there are so many rules and regulations. For example, if you have a tattoo or a body piercing, you're automatically disqualified because there's a chance you've been exposed to hepatitis B or C .  Does weight affect male fertility? Yes. In fact, one of the best things a man can do to protect his fertility is whittle his waist. Obesity in general is associated with male infertility . Additionally, a man's waist size is directly proportional to his testosterone level. All fat cells break down testosterone, but belly fat destroys testosterone the fastest, because visceral fat is broken down into estrogen more quickly than other types of fat. Estrogen basically cancels out testosterone in this situation – so the higher a man's waist measurement, the lower his testosterone level. Plus, men who are overweight often lead sedentary lives and have other health problems. For instance, a waist size of 40 inches or more is an independent risk factor for heart disease in men, and because heart disease slows blood flow throughout the body, what's bad for the heart is bad for the penis. If you're a man who had a 34-inch waist when you were 20 and you're at 40 inches now, you're in trouble. In most men, 5 pounds equals 1 inch around the waist. Aim for a healthy weight, but don't go overboard. Men who are too thin also struggle with low testosterone: If the body isn't getting sufficient nutrients, it often shifts into a conservation mode and produces fewer sex hormones.  What can men do to turn back their clock? The best thing about the male biological clock is that it's usually reversible. Losing weight, having an infection treated, or getting a blockage cleared up can sometimes do the trick. But you need to be tested before you can be treated. So if a couple is having problems getting pregnant, it's important for the man to see a specialist . When it comes to infertility , 40 percent of the time the problem lies with the man, in another 40 percent of cases it's the woman, and 20 percent of the time both partners have contributing factors or the cause is unknown. But male infertility is almost always easier to diagnose and remedy than female infertility, so it's always worth starting with him. One of the biggest causes of male infertility is infection in some part of the reproductive tract, such as the prostate. A low-grade infection can go undetected for years while silently damaging or killing sperm. I can't tell you how many pregnancies I've seen happen just by putting the man on antibiotics. Other common causes of male infertility are clogged ejaculatory ducts and enlarged veins in the scrotum, called varicoceles. All of these conditions are treatable.  What do other top fertility experts have to say? "We know a lot less about the male biological clock than about the female version, and for a long time men didn't want to admit it was an issue. Denial was easy because men don't have a barometer for fertility the way women have a period every month. But it's become clear that there is a hormonal decline as men get older." – Paul Shin , urologist and director of male infertility treatment at George Washington Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "The concept of a male biological clock is appropriate – as men age, their testosterone levels go down – but the change is much less dramatic than women's loss of estrogen. By age 45, 99 percent of women are infertile while most men are still fertile at age 60 and beyond. Still, men who want to conceive later in life should have a semen analysis and not assume they are fertile." – Mark Leondires , fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut "One of the best markers we have of the male biological clock is an increase in DNA-damaged sperm. At age 25, only 5 percent of a man's sperm has DNA damage; by age 35, that percentage has grown to 20 percent. That's a fourfold increase in just ten years. As the percentage of damaged sperm increases, the odds of fertilization decrease." – Narendra Singh , associate professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Washington, Seattle "Using the male biological clock to describe a man's fertility as he ages is a bad choice of words. The phrase conjures up a false sense of finality. If you look at the percentage of men over age 50 with low testosterone, it's about 15 percent. In comparison, nearly 100 percent of women over age 50 have low estrogen." – Larry Lipshultz , professor of urology and director of Male Reproductive Medicine and Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and chairman of the American Urological Association's Council on Reproductive Health Learn more: Common causes of fertility problems in men Pinpointing a fertility problem Fertility treatment: Your options at a glance     Show sources       Hide sources       ACOG.

" Zocdoc › Answers › What contributes to a man becoming sterile? Question How do men become sterile? Is it something where you?re born that way or do things that you do make you sterile? I?m 30 years old and want to have kids some day so I want to make sure I avoid anything that might cause infertility. Answer There are many reasons that a man can become sterile.  At a younger age such as yours, the most common cause of male infertility is a low sperm count.  A low sperm count is defined as a lack of the critical number of sperm per ejaculate that the man needs to make it statistically likely that he would be able to impregnate a woman.  In the vast majority of cases, we never know why a man has a low sperm count.  Because it is not known why the sperm count is low, there is little that can be done to bring it up.  Most of the time, physicians recommend wearing lose fitting undergarments as one means of increasing sperm counts, but this does not work in every case.  Other causes of infertility include certain medications.  The most common offenders are chemotherapy drugs.  Men that unfortunately develop cancer at a young age and require chemotherapy are more likely to become sterile.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.  The two of you can discuss this issue.  If you have never tried to have kids, and you don't have any risk factors for sterility, then your doctor will likely just reassure you that you should be fine.  We only test sperm counts when a couple has tried and failed to get pregnant. Need more info? See a doctor today Related questions What do three dots on the side of the penis mean?

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

This means they aren't able to conceive a child even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer. In up to half of these couples, male infertility plays a role.  Male infertility is due to low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors can play a role in causing male infertility.  Not being able to conceive a child can be stressful and frustrating, but a number of male infertility treatments are available.      Symptoms The main sign of male infertility is the inability to conceive a child. There may be no other obvious signs or symptoms. In some cases, however, an underlying problem such as an inherited disorder, hormonal imbalance, dilated veins around the testicle, or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm causes signs and symptoms.  Although most men with male infertility do not notice symptoms other than inability to conceive a child, signs and symptoms associated with male infertility include:   Problems with sexual function — for example, difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of fluid ejaculated, reduced sexual desire or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction)  Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area  Recurrent respiratory infections  Inability to smell  Abnormal breast growth (gynecomastia)  Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosomal or hormonal abnormality  Having a lower than normal sperm count (fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or a total sperm count of less than 39 million per ejaculate)   When to see a doctor  See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following:   Have erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function  Have pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area  Have a history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems  Have had groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Male fertility is a complex process. To get your partner pregnant, the following must occur:   You must produce healthy sperm. Initially, this involves the growth and formation of the male reproductive organs during puberty. At least one of your testicles must be functioning correctly, and your body must produce testosterone and other hormones to trigger and maintain sperm production.  Sperm have to be carried into the semen. Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis.  There needs to be enough sperm in the semen. If the number of sperm in your semen (sperm count) is low, it decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg. A low sperm count is fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or fewer than 39 million per ejaculate.  Sperm must be functional and able to move. If the movement (motility) or function of your sperm is abnormal, the sperm may not be able to reach or penetrate your partner's egg.   Medical causes  Problems with male fertility can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments. Some of these include:    Varicocele. A varicocele is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility. Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it may be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation. Varicoceles result in reduced quality of the sperm.  Treating the varicocele can improve sperm numbers and function, and may potentially improve outcomes when using assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization.   Infection. Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm. These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV. Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved.   Ejaculation issues. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out the tip of the penis. Various health conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, medications, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra.  Some men with spinal cord injuries or certain diseases can't ejaculate semen, even though they still produce sperm. Often in these cases sperm can still be retrieved for use in assisted reproductive techniques.   Antibodies that attack sperm. Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to eliminate them.  Tumors. Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes. In some cases, surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can affect male fertility.  Undescended testicles. In some males, during fetal development one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum). Decreased fertility is more likely in men who have had this condition.  Hormone imbalances. Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves or an abnormality affecting other hormonal systems including the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands. Low testosterone (male hypogonadism) and other hormonal problems have a number of possible underlying causes.   Defects of tubules that transport sperm. Many different tubes carry sperm. They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions.  Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra.   Chromosome defects. Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome — in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (instead of one X and one Y) — cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs. Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann's syndrome and Kartagener's syndrome.  Problems with sexual intercourse. These can include trouble keeping or maintaining an erection sufficient for sex (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse, anatomical abnormalities such as having a urethral opening beneath the penis (hypospadias), or psychological or relationship problems that interfere with sex.  Celiac disease. A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility. Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet.  Certain medications. Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), certain antifungal medications, some ulcer drugs and certain other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility.  Prior surgeries. Certain surgeries may prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others. In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockage or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles.   Environmental causes  Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm production or sperm function. Specific causes include:     Industrial chemicals. Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead may contribute to low sperm counts.  Heavy metal exposure. Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also may cause infertility.  Radiation or X-rays. Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production, though it will often eventually return to normal. With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced.   Overheating the testicles. Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function. Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs may temporarily impair your sperm count.  Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also may increase the temperature in your scrotum and may slightly reduce sperm production.    Health, lifestyle and other causes  Some other causes of male infertility include:   Illicit drug use. Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. Use of cocaine or marijuana may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well.  Alcohol use. Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels, cause erectile dysfunction and decrease sperm production. Liver disease caused by excessive drinking also may lead to fertility problems.  Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. Secondhand smoke also may affect male fertility.  Emotional stress. Stress can interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm. Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including problems with fertility, can affect your sperm count.  Weight. Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm themselves as well as by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.   Certain occupations including welding or those involving prolonged sitting, such as truck driving, may be associated with a risk of infertility. However, the research to support these links is mixed.  Risk factors Risk factors linked to male infertility include:   Smoking tobacco  Using alcohol  Using certain illicit drugs  Being overweight  Having certain past or present infections  Being exposed to toxins  Overheating the testicles  Having experienced trauma to the testicles  Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery  Having a history of undescended testicles  Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder  Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses, such as sickle cell disease  Taking certain medications or undergoing medical treatments, such as surgery or radiation used for treating cancer   Complications Infertility can be stressful for both you and your partner. Complications of male infertility can include:   Surgery or other procedures to treat an underlying cause of low sperm count or other reproductive problems  Expensive and involved reproductive techniques  Stress and relationship difficulties related to the inability to have a child   Prevention Many types of male infertility aren't preventable. However, you can avoid some known causes of male infertility. For example:   Don't smoke.  Limit or abstain from alcohol.  Steer clear of illicit drugs.  Keep the weight off.  Don't get a vasectomy.  Avoid things that lead to prolonged heat for the testicles.  Reduce stress.  Avoid exposure to pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins.

Reproduction (or making a baby) is a simple and natural experience for most couples. However, for some couples it is very difficult to conceive.  A man’s fertility generally relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm. If the number of sperm a man ejaculates is low or if the sperm are of a poor quality, it will be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for him to cause a pregnancy.  Male infertility is diagnosed when, after testing both partners, reproductive problems have been found in the male.  How common is male infertility?  Infertility is a widespread problem. For about one in five infertile couples the problem lies solely in the male partner.  It is estimated that one in 20 men has some kind of fertility problem with low numbers of sperm in his ejaculate. However, only about one in every 100 men has no sperm in his ejaculate.  What are the symptoms of male infertility?  In most cases, there are no obvious signs of infertility. Intercourse, erections and ejaculation will usually happen without difficulty. The quantity and appearance of the ejaculated semen generally appears normal to the naked eye.  Medical tests are needed to find out if a man is infertile.  What causes male infertility?  Male infertility is usually caused by problems that affect either sperm production or sperm transport. Through medical testing, the doctor may be able to find the cause of the problem.  About two-thirds of infertile men have a problem with making sperm in the testes. Either low numbers of sperm are made and/or the sperm that are made do not work properly.  Sperm transport problems are found in about one in every five infertile men, including men who have had a vasectomy but now wish to have more children. Blockages (often referred to as obstructions) in the tubes leading sperm away from the testes to the penis can cause a complete lack of sperm in the ejaculated semen.  Other less common causes of infertility include: sexual problems that affect whether semen is able to enter the woman’s vagina for fertilisation to take place (one in 100 infertile couples); low levels of hormones made in the pituitary gland that act on the testes (one in 100 infertile men); and sperm antibodies (found in one in 16 infertile men). In most men sperm antibodies will not affect the chance of a pregnancy but in some men sperm antibodies reduce fertility.  Known causes of male infertility     Sperm production problems • Chromosomal or genetic causes • Undescended testes (failure of the testes to descend at birth) • Infections • Torsion (twisting of the testis in scrotum) • Varicocele (varicose veins of the testes) • Medicines and chemicals • Radiation damage • Unknown cause    Blockage of sperm transport • Infections • Prostate-related problems • Absence of vas deferens • Vasectomy    Sexual problems (erection and ejaculation problems) • Retrograde and premature ejaculation • Failure of ejaculation • Erectile dysfunction • Infrequent intercourse • Spinal cord injury • Prostate surgery • Damage to nerves • Some medicines    Hormonal problems • Pituitary tumours • Congenital lack of LH/FSH (pituitary problem from birth) • Anabolic (androgenic) steroid abuse    Sperm antibodies • Vasectomy • Injury or infection in the epididymis • Unknown cause      The male reproductive system  The male reproductive system is made up of the testes, a system of ducts (tubes) and other glands that open into the ducts. The brain plays an important part in the control of the male reproductive system.  A side view showing the main parts of the male reproductive system  The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain, control the production of male hormones and sperm. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are the two important messenger hormones made by the pituitary gland that act on the testes.  Two messenger hormones act on the testes  The testes (testis: singular) are a pair of egg-shaped glands that sit in the scrotum next to the base of the penis on the outside of the body. The testes make sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. It takes about 70 days for sperm to become mature and able to fertilise an egg.  When released from the testes, the sperm spend two to 10 days passing through the epididymis where they gain the vital ability to swim strongly (become ‘motile’), and to attach to and penetrate (get into) the egg.  At orgasm, waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm, with a small amount of fluid, from the testes through to the vas deferens. The seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. This mixture of sperm and fluid (the semen) travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is ejaculated (released).     Diagnosis  How is male infertility diagnosed?  If a couple has been trying for a pregnancy without success, they should go to their local doctor, family planning clinic or women’s health clinic, and have some initial tests. Both partners should be tested, even if one has a child from another relationship. Diagnosis can involve a medical history from the man and a physical examination along with a semen analysis to check the number, shape and movement of sperm in the ejaculate.  Blood tests may also be done to check the levels of hormones that control sperm production. Genetic investigations and testicular biopsies are sometimes done.    Treatment  How is male infertility treated?  One in eight infertile men has a treatable condition, and after treatment, couples can become pregnant naturally.  In some cases, the doctor will recommend that the couple seek assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as IVF (in vitro fertilisation). ART do not cure or treat the cause of infertility but they can help couples achieve a pregnancy, even if the man’s sperm count is very low.  What is ICSI?  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a form of IVF where a single sperm is placed directly into each egg by piercing the outer covering of the egg. ICSI is particularly helpful for men with poor sperm production. Sperm are collected from the semen or removed carefully from the testis or epididymis.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)  ICSI can achieve pregnancies even when only a few sperm are produced.  As for IVF, after fertilisation the resulting embryos are then placed into the woman’s uterus.    Management & support  Can I do anything to prevent male infertility?  It is best to avoid cigarette smoking, excess alcohol, sexually transmitted infections, heat stress from tight fitting underwear, and anabolic steroids (taken for body building or sporting purposes) as these factors can be harmful to the production of sperm.  If you work in an occupation that may affect your fertility, it’s important to wear protective clothing and follow all occupational health and safety guidelines. It is recommended that couples trying to conceive avoid exposure to any possibly harmful chemicals.  Because of the possible effects on fertility, it’s important to tell your doctor if you have had hormone treatment or had surgery as a child to move your testes into the scrotum.  Can older age cause male fertility problems?  Healthy men in their 70s and beyond can still father children, however the time taken for a partner to become pregnant is longer when a man is middle-aged or older. Reasons for this may include a decrease in sexual activity, lower semen volume, changes to sperm motility (movement), a lower number of motile sperm, and possibly lower sperm function and DNA quality.  The chance of the child having some genetic or chromosomal problem is also increased for older men.  What emotions might a man experience when diagnosed with infertility?  Men may be shocked when they find out they are infertile. There is still a common but incorrect belief that infertility is a woman’s problem. Therefore, when men are told there is a sperm problem, they are often unprepared.  Being told that there is a sperm problem can affect a man’s sense of masculinity, sexuality and potency. Most infertile men at some time struggle with the idea that they are not able to do what other men can.  An emotional response to infertility is normal. Talking with a doctor or a sexual therapist or counsellor can help some men with their feelings about infertility.

Christopher L. Starks, MD on behalf of StoneSprings Hospital Center    Urology         In this video, Christopher Starks, MD from StoneSprings Hospital Center, says that about 40 percent of infertility is attributable to the male.                     Univ. of Nev. School of Medicine, Family Medicine    Family Medicine         Infertility is defined as a couple being unable to become pregnant after 1 year of regular intercourse without contraception. Infertility is a very complex problem and can be due to many different causes affecting either the male or female. One study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that infertility was due to female causes 37% of the time, male causes 8% of the time, and both 35% of the time. The initial evaluation for a male who is concerned about infertility commonly includes semen analysis to evaluate the number of sperm and, oftentimes, their quality.                   Erika Tabke on behalf of Honor Society of Nursing (STTI)    Nursing         Infertility is equally attributable to both the male and female partners. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, about 40% of infertility cases are due to male factors, about 40% are due to female factors, and the remaining 20% are either a combination of both partners' factors or are unknown/unexplained. Infertility is neither partners' "fault" - it is simply a medical issue that couples must face together. It is estimated that 12% of the population or one in eight couples of reproductive age are affected by infertility.

From a man's point of view, starting a family is easy. While women are on the job for nine months, men can often complete the task in a single evening. When it comes time to try for a pregnancy, they just naturally assume that it will happen. But among the couples who try unsuccessfully for months or even years to get pregnant, about half the time the problem lies either with both partners or with the man.  In the past, women nearly always took the blame when couples failed to conceive. Today we know that fertility is a two-person job. If a woman doesn't get pregnant after more than a year of trying, there's a 30 to 40 percent chance that her partner's fertility problem may play a role, according to a report in the Journal of Urology. Many men don't produce enough sperm, and the sperm they make may be too slow or oddly shaped. Without a few billion sleek, powerful swimmers working on a guy's behalf, fatherhood can be a difficult destination.  A treatable condition  Fortunately, male infertility is often temporary and treatable, says Larry Lipshultz, chief of the division of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine. If a couple has trouble conceiving, both partners should be evaluated by a urologist or a reproductive endocrinologist who specializes in fertility problems, he says. Even men who've fathered children in the past should get a checkup, he says.  For the man, the search for answers will start with a semen analysis. Typically, a doctor will check at least two samples collected a month apart. If a man's samples contain large amounts of active, normal-looking sperm, chances are he's fertile. But if anything seems out of the ordinary, he'll need a thorough physical exam and lab work to get to the root of the problem.  Men may be reluctant to see a doctor for such a personal matter, but they have strong incentives to get help, Lipshultz says. For one thing, a doctor may find a solution for their infertility. At the other end of the spectrum -- and more rarely -- a doctor may determine that biological fatherhood will be impossible, a finding that could help a couple avoid years of frustration and costly fertility treatments. There's another reason to get help, Lipschultz says. In roughly 2 percent of all cases, male infertility is a symptom of a life-threatening disease such as testicular cancer. If a man ignores his fertility problems, he can lose more than a chance for fatherhood.  Most infertile men have reason for optimism. In a study described in Postgraduate Medicine, 76 percent of men who sought treatment for fertility problems had a potentially correctable condition. Among the men who underwent treatment, 32 percent fathered a child without any other medical help, and another 43 percent showed improvement in the number or quality of their sperm.  Blockages in various parts of the sperm pathway are a common, treatable cause of male infertility. These blockages often occur as a result of infections, including the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and gonorrhea. In many cases, surgery can remove the obstruction and get the sperm back on their way. Another form of obstruction is "congenital absence of the vas deferens," common in men who have cystic fibrosis. Other potentially treatable causes of infertility include hormone imbalances, inflammation in the urinary system (including prostatitis and urethritis), and retrograde ejaculation, a condition in which semen flows into the bladder.  Some experts say that varicose veins or "varicoceles," in the testicles can lead to male infertility. As reported in Postgraduate Medicine, these twisted, enlarged veins may hamper sperm production, and the effect tends to get worse over time. "The sooner these can be diagnosed and treated, the better the results," Lipshultz says. A number of doctors assert that surgical repair of the vessels can improve sperm counts and boost the odds of pregnancy, but others say the link between varicoceles and infertility isn't firmly established.  Sometimes a man's hobbies can interfere with infertility. According to a small study conducted in Austria, frequent mountain biking may contribute to a man's infertility. The study looked at 55 avid mountain bikers and found that nearly 90 percent had low sperm counts and abnormalities in their scrotums. In contrast, only 26 percent of 35 non-bike riders had similar damage.  The study, presented at an annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, suggests that the frequent jolts and vibration associated with riding over rough terrain may be to blame. Infertility problems were most common in frequent bike riders who rode about 60 miles a week.  If there's no clear physical explanation for infertility, it's time to take a close look at what a man puts in his body. As reported in Postgraduate Medicine, some common prescription drugs can hamper sperm production. It's important to tell your doctor all the drugs you've been taking. The list of potential culprits includes the heartburn medication cimetidine (Tagamet), the rheumatoid arthritis drug sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), and several chemotherapy drugs. In some cases, a change in a prescription can restore fertility. Likewise, a man may be able to give his sperm a boost by avoiding cigarettes and going easy on alcohol. Heavy drinking can lead to a decrease in sperm count and movement, and smoking harms sperm's motility (ability to move). He should also stay away from recreational drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids.  Stress, obesity, malnutrition, radiation, major surgery, and overexposure to heat, chemicals, and poisons in the environment may also affect fertility. Pesticides with effects similar to those of estrogen have been linked strongly to a drop in sperm production, as has the insecticide DBCP.  Father-friendly tips  If a man tells friends and relatives about his fertility troubles, it often unleashes an avalanche of advice -- some good, some bad. Almost invariably, someone will tell him he needs to wear loose pants and boxer shorts. This common belief is still being debated in the medical community, as studies on the impact of tight-fitting underwear on scrotal temperature are contradictory. Someone else might suggest an herbal "fertility" remedy. There's no evidence that these will take a man any closer to fatherhood, according to a report from the University of Iowa -- and worse, some herbal remedies could be harmful. Since herbs aren't tested for safety and efficacy, as prescription drugs are, men should talk with their doctors before experimenting with any supplement.  Some pieces of common wisdom actually turn out to be true. According to a report from the Mayo Clinic, a man trying to start a family really should stay clear of hot tubs or saunas: The sperm factories in the testicles don't work well under high temperatures. A Stony Brook University Hospital study found that men may also be feeling the heat from another direction -- laptop computers. Researchers found that holding a laptop computer on a man's lap for only an hour raised his testes temperature by 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit, which might be enough to impair fertility. Further research is needed to confirm the findings, say researchers.  Other options  Even if a man takes all the right steps and gets the best treatment possible, he may still be unable to father a child the "old-fashioned" way. But as long as he produces at least a few healthy sperm, there's still hope.  In a procedure known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), doctors collect a single sperm and inject it directly into a woman's egg in a laboratory dish. After fertilization, the embryo is implanted in the woman's uterus. According to the CDC, about 32 percent of ICSI procedures resulted in live births in 2007. In women under 35, pregnancy rates can be 60 percent or higher. Unfortunately, one cycle of ICSI costs from $10,000 to $20,000 -- a high price for a procedure with no guarantees.  After consulting with doctors and, more importantly, with each other, many couples decide not to try such measures. They may turn to a sperm bank or an adoption agency, or decide on a life without children. Some feelings of disappointment are inevitable, but at least they can get off the emotional roller-coaster they experienced month after month.  As easy as it seems, fatherhood isn't for everyone. It only comes to men who are either naturally fertile or willing to take action. A growing number of men are finding the courage to make that first call to the doctor. Their spouses are grateful -- and their children will be too.

In 2006 she began channeling her knowledge into health-related articles for print and online publications. Her work has appeared in "Metroparent Magazine," "Anew Heart Healthcare Magazine" and community newspapers. Lewis earned a diploma from LongRidge Writers Institute.            Signs of Sterility in Males          When a couple is unable to conceive after a year of unprotected sex, infertility is likely the problem. Men are as likely to be sterile as women are, according to the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. Certain factors can raise the risks of sterility in males. Habits like smoking, drinking and drugs or alcohol are considered chemical causes of sterility. Other factors that might lead to sterility are stress and poor nutrition. If these causes have been ruled out, testicular, hormonal, ejaculatory or sperm transport problems may be the cause.   Video of the Day             Testicles  The testicles are important components in fertility. They are small, oval-shaped organs that produce testosterone and sperm. Testosterone is a hormone responsible for male characteristics like facial hair and a low voice. It is crucial to erections and libido. Sperm is necessary for fertilizing female eggs. When testicular problems exist, signs like masses on the scrotum, one smaller testicle and little or no sperm might exist. These issues can cause sterility in males. In addition, slightly enlarged breast tissue or undescended testicles are other signs. Testicles that have not naturally descended into the scrotum decrease fertility and can increase the likelihood of cancer, according to the National Library of Medicine.            Ejaculatory Problems  A male's inability to ejaculate could be the cause of sterility. Ejaculation occurs when an orgasm is achieved and sperm is propelled into a woman's vagina and on to her uterus, where sperm search for eggs to implant. Ejaculatory problems can cause sterility in males. Symptoms that indicate a problem include trouble achieving or maintaining an erection, orgasms that do not result in excretion of semen and unusual urination symptoms. After an orgasm, if urine appears milky or white, ejaculation problems could be the cause.  Hormonal Problems  Hormonal problems are not just a women's issue. Men also have various hormones in their body that can fluctuate and impede normal functions. Factors that affect a male's hormone levels can result in sterility. Clues that indicate such problems include blurred vision, small or soft testicles, impotence, changes in hair growth patterns, voice changes, insomnia, irritability, muscle weakness and advanced maturation in boys. If these or any of the above signs are present, check with your doctor or seek help from a fertility specialist.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

Experts reveal the 23 things that can leave men infertile - and how to avoid a diminished sperm supply  Male sperm counts have declined by more than half over the past 50 years Genes contained in the sperm of older men are more likely to be abnormal Close-fitting underwear hinders a male's supply of sperm, experts say Exercising too much can impair a man's natural fertility chances By Thea Jourdan For The Hippocratic Post   Published: 07:19 EDT, 7 November 2016 |  Updated: 10:14 EDT, 7 November 2016              e-mail          91  shares     62  View comments     There was a time when infertility was seen as a women's problem. Not anymore. Older dads are more likely to pass on genetic mutations to their offspring than older mums, according to research. And studies show that male infertility is behind half of all cases where couples fail to conceive after one year. Sperm counts in men worldwide have declined by half over the past 50 years and are continuing to fall. Here, in a piece for The Hippocratic Post , a range of experts reveal 23 things that could be diminishing your partner's supply - and what can be done to prevent it. Scroll down for video          Sperm counts in men worldwide have declined by more than half over the past 50 years. But there are plenty of ways that men can optimise their quantity and quality The average European sperm count is in the region of 70 million per millilitre. According to the World Health Organisation, a man needs a sperm count of at least 20 million sperm per millilitre of ejaculate to have a chance of conceiving a child without medical intervention. Sperm, which are the swimming cells that carry a male's DNA, are continually produced in the testicles at the rate of up to 100 million every day.

It then takes a further 10 to 14 days for the sperm to pass through the epididymis, which is where they mature, before they can leave the body via ejaculation. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways that men can optimise the quantity and quality of their sperm. BIOLOGICAL CLOCK          Studies have shown that men's fertility starts to decline after the age of 35 Men have a biological clock just like women. Studies have shown that men's fertility starts to decline after the age of 35 and female partners, regardless of their own age, have less chance of getting pregnant. One French study, published in published in the journal Fertility and Sterility in 2005, found that women younger than 30 years old was 25 per cent less likely to conceive a baby if her male partner was 40 years or older. A woman aged 35 to 37 years was 50 per cent less likely to conceive if the male partner was over 40 years old. Studies have shown that the genes contained in the sperm of older men have a greater chance of being abnormal. A study at the University of California, Berkeley found that the sperm of older men were less mobile and less able to move in a straight line. Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, says: 'We have known for some time that children of older fathers have a higher risk of being born with a range of genetically linked diseases such as Down's syndrome, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders among others. 'There is also evidence that as men get older their partner is at increased risk of infertility and miscarriage because of genetic changes which are evident in his sperm.' WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT You can't turn back the clock and the age of first time fathers in the UK is rising steadily to 32 compared to 27 in 1980. However, perhaps it is time for a rethink, according to Dr Pacey who points out that men over the age of 40 are advised against donating sperm. 'Whilst not wanting to scare the children of older fathers, information like this is important to understand and should remind us that nature designed us to have our children at a young age and if at all possible men and women should not delay parenthood if they are in a position not to.' TIGHT UNDERWEAR          Close-fitting underwear is going to hinder your chance of conceiving a child, as modeled by ex-footballer David Beckham, experts say Male models – and footballer David Beckham – may look great in tight designer briefs, but close-fitting underwear is going to hinder your chance of conceiving a child. That's the conclusion of a large-scale study of 2500 men published in the journal Human Reproduction in June 2012 by researchers at the University of Sheffield and the University of Manchester. Dr Allan Pacey, one of the lead researchers, explains: 'What we found is that the single biggest lifestyle factor affecting sperm count was tight underwear.' The reason is probably related to underwear pulling the testicles closer to the body, reducing air circulation and causing the temperature of inside the testes to rise. 'The scrotum sac hangs outside the body for a reason because testes work at an optimum temperature of around 35 degrees centigrade, or two degrees cooler than body temperature,' says Dr Pacey. Testes that are too hot produce less sperm because the seminferous epithelium, which lines the tubules where cell division takes place, is sensitive to elevated temperatures. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'Switch to boxer shorts and trousers which have room over the groin,' says Dr Pacey. 'Skinny jeans and tight cycling shorts probably have the same negative effect although we did not investigate this in our study.' It will take three months to bring fertility levels back to normal. 'This is how long the body takes to produce a sperm cell from the beginning to the end of the process,' explains Dr Pacey. UNDESCENDED TESTICLE          Testicles that remain inside the body and have not come down into the scrotal sac will not be producing viable sperm (stock) This is a common problem that occurs in 3-4 per cent of full term infants but it usually resolves itself before a child is a year old. Occasionally, a male may reach adulthood with the problem still unresolved. Testicles that remain inside the body and have not come down into the scrotal sac will not be producing viable sperm. They are considered abnormal and are also more prone to becoming cancerous. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT If the testes does not descend on its own, surgeons may perform an operation called an orchiopexy to bring the testes down and stitch it in place within the scrotum. 'Occasionally, this procedure can be carried out on adolescents or adult males and is usually successful,' says Dr Pacey. CANCER TREATMENT          Radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can also impair sperm production 'Men who have undergone cancer treatment may find that their fertility has been affected,' says Dr Mike Bowen, a consultant gynaecologist based in Oxford. In particular, up to 70 per cent of men who have prostate cancer and have undergone a radical prostatectomy will not be able to maintain an erection after surgery, according to Cancer Research UK. Radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can also impair sperm production. If radiation is focused on or near the pelvic area, abdomen, spine, and/or the whole body, it may reduce sperm count and motility in boys — these conditions may be permanent or may reverse after the treatment if sperm production recovers. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 'In many cases, specialists may advise patients to freeze sperm for future use,' says Dr Bowen. 'Men who have erectile dysfunction may be helped by the drug Viagra.' Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely to lead to permanent infertility than others. The high-risk drugs most likely to affect reproductive organs are Cytoxan, Ifosfamide, Procarbazine, Busulfan, and Melphalan. Others, like vincristine and methotrexate, are typically less likely to harm fertility. BEING ILL          Being ill can affect male fertility, but experts say further research is needed to determine why A huge number of illnesses can affect male fertility. Cardiovascular disease, which affects blood circulation, can lead to impotence and failure to maintain an erection. Diabetes, when the body cannot control blood sugar levels and its complications, is another major cause of impotence. A body of research shows that sperm produced by a man with diabetes are more damaged than those from a non-diabetic and less able to fertilise an egg. Further studies are needed in order to determine why this happens and the extent of the problem. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the primary way to minimise your risk of disease and alleviate symptoms of established health problems. Statins are drugs which can help control the complications of cardiovascular disease and may also have a role to play in disease prevention. Control your diabetes through diet and exercise and medication. RANGE OF MEDICATIONS          Some medications may act to decrease male sexual interest in intercourse, or libido. Others may interfere with the ability of a man to get an erection or ejaculate 'Many different types of medication can affect male fertility through different ways,' says Dr Jane Stewart. Some, like the antiobiotic erythromycin, are toxic to the testicles and damage cells that produce sperm – sometimes permanently. Others work indirectly, interrupting hormonal signals that stimulate the cells in the testicles which can result in lower sperm counts, like antipsychotic drugs and trycyclic anti-depressants. Some medications may act to decrease male sexual interest in intercourse, or libido. Other medications may interfere with the ability of a man to get an erection or ejaculate. The antiobiotic tetracycline can block fertilisation. Calcium channel blockers, which are used to treat high blood pressure, have been shown in some studies to block the ability of the sperm to fertilize an egg. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 'This is a question of weighing up your options and discussing them with your doctor,' says consultant gynaecologist Dr Mike Bowen. 'It may be that the risk of in fertility is outweighed by the benefit of the drug. Or there may be an alternative medication which will not have this affect.' SUFFERING FROM VARIOCELE          Variocele, which leads to abnormally dilated veins around the testicles, is one of the most common causes of male infertility Variocele, which leads to abnormally dilated veins around the testicles, is one of the most common causes of male infertility because it increases the temperature of the scrotum. The testes work most effectively at 35 degrees centigrade – two degrees cooler than the rest of the body. Around 15 per cent of the male population has variocele and 40 per cent of men diagnosed with infertility have this condition. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) on over 9,000 men showed that varicocele are commonly accompanied by decreased testicular volume and impaired sperm quality. Varicoceles which are untreated cause more damage to the testicles as time goes on. WHAT YOU CAN DO Surgery to tie off the damaged veins not only halts decline in testicular function but often reverses it. Around 80 per cent of men who undergo the surgery will have improved quality and quantity of sperm. Recent studies also show that female partners of men who have undergone the operation are more likely to get pregnant. BLOCKED DUCTS          Infections, particularly chlamydia and gonnorrhea, can lead to blockages of the tubes which carry the sperm from the testes through the penis Blocked ducts are an obvious mechanical cause of male infertility. When sperm is almost fully formed, it is stored in two coiled tubes called the epididymides to mature. At the point of ejaculation it moves from the epididymides to the vas deferens where it is expelled from the penis. Infections, particularly chlamydia and gonnorrhea, can lead to blockages of the tubes which carry the sperm from the testes through the penis. A blockage can also be caused by an inherited defect or a groin injury. WHAT YOU CAN DO If you play contact sports, wear groin protection. Avoid sexually transmitted infections which can lead to duct blockage. 'If you suspect you have a sexually transmitted infection, go to see your doctor for advice and early treatment,' says Mr Mike Bowen. STAYING FIT          It is important to stay fit and exercise regularly if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child, experts say Staying fit and healthy and exercising regularly is important if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child. However, men and women who exercise too much can impair their natural fertility. 'There is evidence that some endurance trained men can affect their reproductive hormone profile, in particular reducing their testosterone levels,' says Mr Bowen. 'However, there is no direct evidence that this results in male infertility.' Cycling is becoming more popular both as a recreation and a means of beating commuter traffic, but too much cycling can lead to impotence, according to Vinod Nargund, a consultant urological surgeon at St Bartholomew's and Homerton Hospitals London. This is because of prolonged pressure from the saddle on the perineum, which is the area of skin behind the scrotum. This is where nerves and blood vessels enter the penis. Studies on volunteers have shown that cycling in a standing position does not alter penile blood supply after exercise and remain the same as before exercise. Numbness of the genital region is reported by more than 60 per cent of the cyclists. There is a higher incidence of numbness and erectile problems in men who cycle regularly on longer training distances. Penile blood flow is affected due to the compression of vessels by sitting on the saddle. WHAT YOU CAN DO Try a softer saddle and stand up to pedal. 'Studies on volunteers have shown that cycling in a standing position does not alter penile blood supply after exercise and remain the same as before exercise,' says Mr Nargund. 'It is important therefore to take rests intermittently during prolonged and vigorous bicycle riding and to restrict the training distance. BEING OVERLY HOT          Anything that raises the temperature of the testicles is going to have a temporary impact on sperm production Anything that raises the temperature of your testicles is going to have a temporary impact on sperm production, even sitting on a crowded commuter train for long periods in a heatwave. Frequent use of hot tubs or saunas may lower your sperm count, according to studies. Spending more than 30 minutes at a time in water heated to 40 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) or more may lower the sperm count significantly. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'Avoid saunas and hot tubs if you are trying to conceive and any other situation where you feel very hot for prolonged periods of time,' says Mike Bowen. FREQUENT SELF-PLEASURE 'Forget the myth that stored sperm goes stale and needs to be refreshed,' says Dr Pacey. 'If you masturbate frequently, you reduce the volume of sperm held in storage and the quantity available when you ejaculate inside your partner.' Studies have shown that ejaculating more than twice a day can have a negative effect on male fertility. Every man is different. Although the average ejaculate contains around 40 million sperm, many men have sperm counts far lower, closer to the 'fertility minimum' set by the World Health Organisation of 20 million sperm per one millilitre of ejaculate. If they masturbate too often, their sperm count could fall below this. Conversely, it can be as high as 100 million per ejaculate. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'If you want to have a maximise your chances of having a baby, you should be having sex with you partner two or three times a week. 'This is the ideal amount to have maximum number of sperm entering your partner's body,' says Dr Jane Stewart, consultant in reproductive medicine at Newcastle Fertility Centre. Any more than this and the volume of ejaculate will be reduced. And limit masturbation until after conception has occurred. A period of total abstinence of 3-5 days should bring levels up to their maximum, according to Dr Pacey. NOT HAVING ENOUGH SEX          A lack of sexual relations is one of the leading causes of failing to conceive a child One of the leading causes of failing to conceive a child is actually lack of sexual relations. And stress plays a major role in turning people off the idea. Stress reduces male fertility in two ways. Firstly, stress hormones like cortisol seem to have an effect on the way that men ejaculate, according to research. High cortisol levels have a dampening effect on testosterone, which in turn lowers the quantity and quality of sperm. If stress is chronic, this can become a long-term problem. 'Stress also has an important negative effect on libido and the desire to have sex in the first place,' says Dr Jane Stewart. 'Men who are stressed may not be able to get an erection at all because of physiological effects of lower levels of testosterone circulating in the body and the psychological effects which are critical to creating desire in the first place.' In fact, 15 per cent of men experience decreased libido because of stress, while 5 per cent of men experience impotence because of it. WHAT YOU CAN DO If stress is reduced, either by taking up meditation or improving work/life balance, the effect on fertility should be reversed almost immediately. Failure to conceive can be an important cause of stress which is why it helps to be relaxed and not too focus on the goal of having a child. LACK OF VITAMIN D          Getting enough UV rays is key to the health of sperm, according to research eight years ago Vitamin D – the sunshine vitamin – is essential to sperm health. In 2006, it was found that human sperm had multiple Vitamin D receptors on its head and nucleus, suggesting that the cell needs this vitamin to function. Getting enough UV rays is key to the health of male sperm, according to research presented to the Fertility Society of Australia conference in 2008. Laura Thomson, a doctoral student from University of Sydney found that vitamin D deficiency – caused by too little sun exposure – played a a significant role in determining male fertility. Thomson's study involved screening 794 men who attended the same fertility clinic in Sydney in Australia. Nearly a third, which is similar to the average, were found to suffer from too little Vitamin D which is synthesised in the skin during exposure to sunlight. A group of 123 of the vitamin D deficient men in the Australian study were followed for 3 months as they took vitamin D containing multivitamin supplements, antioxidants and lost weight. Follow-up tests showed improvements in sperm shape and a 75 per cent drop in sperm DNA fragmentation, when the DNA is damaged. In a quarter of these men, pregnancy was successful. WHAT YOU CAN DO Go easy on sunscreen when you are out and about not in the heat of the day, between 11am and 3pm. Just rolling up your sleeves in your lunch break while outdoors should be enough to help your skin create enough Vitamin D from sunshine. The effects on fertility should be felt within three months. DRINKING TOO MUCH          Too much alcohol can reduce sperm count and change the shape of sperm cells, making them less effective at fertilising an egg Alcohol is a toxin that kills the cells that generate sperm. Too much alcohol can reduce sperm count and change the shape of sperm cells, making them less effective at fertilising an egg. The effects won't be noticeable unless you drink more than eight units in a day, according to studies. Most alcoholics have a very low sex drive because excessive alcohol over a long period of time raises levels of female hormone oestrogen in the male body. WHAT CAN YOU DO Abstain from alcohol or significantly reduce your intake three months before you try to conceive a child. Heavy drinking can damage DNA in all sperm cells held in the testes so it would take three months of reduced drinking to create sperm from scratch. Impotence caused by alcoholism can take longer to reverse or may not be fully reversible. SMOKING TOBACCO          If you want to have a child, give up smoking at least three months before trying to conceive with your partner, experts say 'In terms of how many sperm you produce in the testes, smoking does not seem to have an effect,' says Dr Pacey. 'However, smoking does damage DNA within the sperm cells, which could lead to infertility and miscarriage, which is the female body's way of getting rid of a developing embryo with major genetic abnormalities. A UK study, published in the medical journal Human Reproduction, recruited 2,249 men from 14 fertility clinics around the UK2 and asked them to fill out detailed questionnaires about their lifestyle. Dr Andrew Povey, from the University of Manchester's School of Community Based Medicine, said: 'Despite lifestyle choices being important for other aspects of our health, our results suggest that many lifestyle choices probably have little influence on how many swimming sperm they ejaculate. For example, whether the man was a current smoker or not was of little importance. The proportion of men who had low numbers of swimming sperm was similar whether they had never been a smoker or a smoker who was currently smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day.' WHAT CAN YOU DO Current NICE guidelines remain that men who want to conceive should give up smoking. However, if you want to have a child, give up smoking at least three months before trying to conceive with your partner. Avoid all recreational drugs. BEING OBESE          Men with a higher body mass index had a significantly higher risk of being infertile compared with men considered to be normal weight, previous research found Studies have found links between obesity and fertility problems in both men and women. In one study, men with a higher body mass index (BMI) had a significantly higher risk of being infertile compared with men considered to be normal weight. In fact, the study found that men who are of normal weight and then put on just 20lbs could increase their chance of male infertility by 10 per cent. 'Several mechanisms may account for the effect of obesity on make infertility, including changes in hormone levels caused by increased weight and increased scotal temperatures due to the fact that larger men tend to have hotter groins with fat acting as insulation,' says Mr Bowen. Men who develop 'man boobs' may be more at risk because the condition suggests heightened levels of the female hormone oestrogen. There is no hard evidence that men who have beer bellies are more at risk than those who are bigger all over. A separate study found that men who had a higher BMI were more likely to have poor quality 'fragmented' sperm where the DNA parcel has broken into pieces. Fragmented sperm DNA is linked to reduced fertility as well as an increased risk of miscarriage. Babies born are more likely to suffer from inherited conditions such as Down's Syndrome. WHAT CAN YOU DO Healthy gradual weight loss should take months and possibly even years to achieve, depending on how much you need to drop to reach a healthy BMI. 'However, neither reversibility of obesity-associated fertility with weight loss not effective therapeutic interventions have been studied in depth,' says Mr Bowen. USING YOUR LAPTOP ON YOUR LAP          Dr Suzanne Kavic, a reproductive endocrinologist based in Pittsburgh, advises men not to place their laptops on their laps as heating of the testicles could result in lower sperm counts 'This is all to do with heat generated by the lap top sitting right over the genital region,' explains Dr Suzanne Kavic, a reproductive endocrinologist based in Pittsburgh in the US. 'However, the heat generated from laptops can impact sperm production and development. 'The heat generated from laptops can impact sperm production and development making it difficult to conceive down the road.' Dr Kavic advises men not to place their laptops on their laps at all since any significant heating of the testicles could result in lower sperm counts and poorer sperm quality. WHAT CAN YOU DO Prop your lap top on the table. In most cases, the effects should be reversed within three months or a full cycle of sperm generation. HAVING A POOR DIET          Researchers at the Harvard Medical School have found that diets high in saturated fat may negatively affect the quality, as well as the quantity of sperm There is some evidence that men who eat a diet rich in antioxidants, which mop up damaging free radicals, are more fertile than men who don't. Colourful vegetables include carrots, purple cabbage, leafy greens are rich in antioxidants like Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Fruit including oranges, lemons and bluecurrants are also a rich sources of Vitamin C. Researchers at the Harvard Medical School have found that diets high in saturated fat may negatively affect the quality, as well as the quantity of sperm. They also found that increasing dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, a polyunsaturated fat, could improve male reproductive health. WHAT CAN YOU DO Eat plenty of oily fish and cut down on red meat. A new study has also pinpointed walnuts as an excellent source of good fatty acids. Eating around two handfuls of walnuts a day improves sperm health in young men, a study in the journal Biology of Reproduction suggests. Sperm shape, movement and vitality improved in men who added walnuts to their diet over 12 weeks. BODYBUILDING          Steroids cause an increase in muscle mass but also trick the body into thinking that the testes, which produce natural testosterone, are producing too much The trend for bulking up with the help of anabolic steroids is having a worrying effect on men's fertility up and down the country. 'In the North East, we are certainly noticing an increase in the number of men who do use steroids and come to us with fertility problems,' says Dr Jane Stewart. High protein shakes should not cause the problems but there is increasing concern that they may contain ingredients which are not on the ingredients lists. Steroids, which mimic the male hormone testosterone, cause an increase in muscle mass but they also trick the body into thinking that the testes, which produce natural testosterone, are producing too much. 'Production of sperm can shut down completely,' says Dr Stewart. 'Men may notice that their testes are shrinking.' WHAT CAN YOU DO 'Sadly, infertility caused by use of steroid drugs is not always reversible,' explains Dr Stewart. However, most men who stop taking steroids will see a gradual return to normal over several months or years. Build muscle naturally with exercise and weight training. YOUR JOB          Studies have shown that men who work regularly with lead – roofers and metal smelters – have lower sperm counts Some jobs are riskier than others when it comes to male infertility. Studies have shown that men who work regularly with lead – roofers and metal smelters – have lower sperm counts and IVF couples who have even small traces of lead in their bloodstream are less likely to conceive than those who don't. 'We know that lead is a testicular toxin and lowers production of motile sperm,' says Dr Pacey. Painters and printers who are exposed to the chemical glycol ether are also more at risk. This chemical is found in glues and printing inks. Occupations which involve working in high temperatures like metal smelting have also been linked to male infertility. WHAT CAN YOU DO It may not be possible to avoid the contaminants altogether but men can take precautions such as wearing face masks when dealing with known chemicals and ensuring that products don't come into direct contact with the skin. 'No one knows for sure but I would predict at least three months, so that new sperm are not affected. The problem with lead is that it tends to stay in the body for a long time, so this effect could take years to remove completely,' says Dr Pacey. GUM DISEASE          Bacteria in gums, which easily passes through the mouth into the bloodstream, may have an inflammatory effect on the testes Visit a dental hygienist regularly if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child, according to research. Bacteria in gums, which easily passes through the mouth into the bloodstream, may have an inflammatory effect on other parts of the body including the testes which produce sperm. Scientists in Israel pinpointed gum disease as one of the causes of male infertility, after seeing an increased rate of gum disease among men having trouble with conceiving a child. The Israeli study looked at the sperm quality of 56 men who came into a fertility clinic. They found that 80 per cent of the men suffered from either gum disease and a low sperm count or zero sperm count was found in 68 per cent of the men. WHAT CAN YOU DO Visit a dental hygienist regularly if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child, according to research. The infertility dip can be reversed in a few days after gum disease is eradicated because this is how long it takes any inflammation to subside. GOING VEGETARIAN        A primary source of protein for vegetarians is soya, but research has found over-consuming soya products inhibits sperm production Soya protein, which is a primary source of protein for vegetarians, is a rich source of phyto-oestrogens, or plant oestrogens. Men who drink a lot of soya milk or eat a lot of soya products may inadvertently be raising their levels of female hormones which inhibits sperm production, according to a study carried out by researchers at Queen's University, Belfast. The director of reproductive medicine at Queen's University, Belfast, Dr Sheena Lewis, said: 'What we have shown is that if men are consuming large amounts of soya products, for example, there is a negative relationship between that and the quality of their sperm.' WHAT YOU CAN DO Read the labels on food products. 'If they already have a slight problem in that area, then it might be better for them not to consume so much,' says Dr Lewis who points out that 'hidden' soya protein is often found in fast food and ready meals where it is used to supplement more expensive meat protein. 'You would have to eat a lot to feel the effect,' says Dr Jane Stewart. MOBILE PHONES          'You should probably keep your mobile phone in your jacket pocket rather than in your jeans,' says Dr Stewart Some scientists believe that electromagnetic field exposure from mobile phones may have a negative effect on sperm production. A study published in 2009 found that sperm in a test tube become less active when they are exposed to an electromagnetic field and the DNA within sperm is more likely to break down. Dr Pacey says that the jury is still out and there is no hard evidence that mobile phone emissions have any effect on male fertility. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'It is speculative for now but if you want to play it safe, you should probably keep your mobile phone in your jacket pocket rather than in your jeans,' says Dr Stewart.

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

Reproduction (or making a baby) is a simple and natural experience for most couples. However, for some couples it is very difficult to conceive.  A man’s fertility generally relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm. If the number of sperm a man ejaculates is low or if the sperm are of a poor quality, it will be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for him to cause a pregnancy.  Male infertility is diagnosed when, after testing both partners, reproductive problems have been found in the male.  How common is male infertility?  Infertility is a widespread problem. For about one in five infertile couples the problem lies solely in the male partner.  It is estimated that one in 20 men has some kind of fertility problem with low numbers of sperm in his ejaculate. However, only about one in every 100 men has no sperm in his ejaculate.  What are the symptoms of male infertility?  In most cases, there are no obvious signs of infertility. Intercourse, erections and ejaculation will usually happen without difficulty. The quantity and appearance of the ejaculated semen generally appears normal to the naked eye.  Medical tests are needed to find out if a man is infertile.  What causes male infertility?  Male infertility is usually caused by problems that affect either sperm production or sperm transport. Through medical testing, the doctor may be able to find the cause of the problem.  About two-thirds of infertile men have a problem with making sperm in the testes. Either low numbers of sperm are made and/or the sperm that are made do not work properly.  Sperm transport problems are found in about one in every five infertile men, including men who have had a vasectomy but now wish to have more children. Blockages (often referred to as obstructions) in the tubes leading sperm away from the testes to the penis can cause a complete lack of sperm in the ejaculated semen.  Other less common causes of infertility include: sexual problems that affect whether semen is able to enter the woman’s vagina for fertilisation to take place (one in 100 infertile couples); low levels of hormones made in the pituitary gland that act on the testes (one in 100 infertile men); and sperm antibodies (found in one in 16 infertile men). In most men sperm antibodies will not affect the chance of a pregnancy but in some men sperm antibodies reduce fertility.  Known causes of male infertility     Sperm production problems • Chromosomal or genetic causes • Undescended testes (failure of the testes to descend at birth) • Infections • Torsion (twisting of the testis in scrotum) • Varicocele (varicose veins of the testes) • Medicines and chemicals • Radiation damage • Unknown cause    Blockage of sperm transport • Infections • Prostate-related problems • Absence of vas deferens • Vasectomy    Sexual problems (erection and ejaculation problems) • Retrograde and premature ejaculation • Failure of ejaculation • Erectile dysfunction • Infrequent intercourse • Spinal cord injury • Prostate surgery • Damage to nerves • Some medicines    Hormonal problems • Pituitary tumours • Congenital lack of LH/FSH (pituitary problem from birth) • Anabolic (androgenic) steroid abuse    Sperm antibodies • Vasectomy • Injury or infection in the epididymis • Unknown cause      The male reproductive system  The male reproductive system is made up of the testes, a system of ducts (tubes) and other glands that open into the ducts. The brain plays an important part in the control of the male reproductive system.  A side view showing the main parts of the male reproductive system  The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain, control the production of male hormones and sperm. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are the two important messenger hormones made by the pituitary gland that act on the testes.  Two messenger hormones act on the testes  The testes (testis: singular) are a pair of egg-shaped glands that sit in the scrotum next to the base of the penis on the outside of the body. The testes make sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. It takes about 70 days for sperm to become mature and able to fertilise an egg.  When released from the testes, the sperm spend two to 10 days passing through the epididymis where they gain the vital ability to swim strongly (become ‘motile’), and to attach to and penetrate (get into) the egg.  At orgasm, waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm, with a small amount of fluid, from the testes through to the vas deferens. The seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. This mixture of sperm and fluid (the semen) travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is ejaculated (released).     Diagnosis  How is male infertility diagnosed?  If a couple has been trying for a pregnancy without success, they should go to their local doctor, family planning clinic or women’s health clinic, and have some initial tests. Both partners should be tested, even if one has a child from another relationship. Diagnosis can involve a medical history from the man and a physical examination along with a semen analysis to check the number, shape and movement of sperm in the ejaculate.  Blood tests may also be done to check the levels of hormones that control sperm production. Genetic investigations and testicular biopsies are sometimes done.    Treatment  How is male infertility treated?  One in eight infertile men has a treatable condition, and after treatment, couples can become pregnant naturally.  In some cases, the doctor will recommend that the couple seek assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as IVF (in vitro fertilisation). ART do not cure or treat the cause of infertility but they can help couples achieve a pregnancy, even if the man’s sperm count is very low.  What is ICSI?  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a form of IVF where a single sperm is placed directly into each egg by piercing the outer covering of the egg. ICSI is particularly helpful for men with poor sperm production. Sperm are collected from the semen or removed carefully from the testis or epididymis.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)  ICSI can achieve pregnancies even when only a few sperm are produced.  As for IVF, after fertilisation the resulting embryos are then placed into the woman’s uterus.    Management & support  Can I do anything to prevent male infertility?  It is best to avoid cigarette smoking, excess alcohol, sexually transmitted infections, heat stress from tight fitting underwear, and anabolic steroids (taken for body building or sporting purposes) as these factors can be harmful to the production of sperm.  If you work in an occupation that may affect your fertility, it’s important to wear protective clothing and follow all occupational health and safety guidelines. It is recommended that couples trying to conceive avoid exposure to any possibly harmful chemicals.  Because of the possible effects on fertility, it’s important to tell your doctor if you have had hormone treatment or had surgery as a child to move your testes into the scrotum.  Can older age cause male fertility problems?  Healthy men in their 70s and beyond can still father children, however the time taken for a partner to become pregnant is longer when a man is middle-aged or older. Reasons for this may include a decrease in sexual activity, lower semen volume, changes to sperm motility (movement), a lower number of motile sperm, and possibly lower sperm function and DNA quality.  The chance of the child having some genetic or chromosomal problem is also increased for older men.  What emotions might a man experience when diagnosed with infertility?  Men may be shocked when they find out they are infertile. There is still a common but incorrect belief that infertility is a woman’s problem. Therefore, when men are told there is a sperm problem, they are often unprepared.  Being told that there is a sperm problem can affect a man’s sense of masculinity, sexuality and potency. Most infertile men at some time struggle with the idea that they are not able to do what other men can.  An emotional response to infertility is normal. Talking with a doctor or a sexual therapist or counsellor can help some men with their feelings about infertility.

Does weight affect male fertility?  What can men do to turn back their clock?  What do other top fertility experts have to say?     By Catherine Guthrie   Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: July 2017     If you and your devoted are dancing around the idea of having a baby, odds are you're keeping track of your biological clock. Sure, you know how your age comes into play, but what about the candles on his birthday cake? Should you also be factoring his years into the equation? With 60-somethings like Billy Joel and Jeff Goldblum expanding their broods, it's easy to dismiss your guy's age. But you shouldn't shrug it off completely, says Harry Fisch, a urologist and director of the male reproductive center at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. A leading male fertility expert, Fisch literally wrote the book on the subject: The Male Biological Clock: The Startling News About Aging, Sexuality, and Fertility in Men . BabyCenter sat down with him to find out what you need to know about the fertility of your other half.  What's the biggest myth about men and fertility? The biggest misconception is that men age and nothing changes. Men feel that no matter what they do, everything will be the same. That's just not true. Men's fertility does decline with age. In a study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility , researchers interviewed nearly 2,000 women to find out how long it took them to conceive. Among women 35 and older, those whose male partners were 45 and older took five times longer to conceive than those whose partners were 25 and younger. The researchers also looked at what happens when young women (age 25 and under) have children with men 45 and older. The researchers found a fourfold increase in the time it took couples to conceive – meaning the man's age was a factor independent of the woman's age.  How do men's and women's biological clocks differ? They are distinctly different. A woman's egg supply is set before birth, declines dramatically even before she's out of the womb, and by the time she reaches menopause, most of her eggs are gone. In addition to that, a woman's left not just with fewer and fewer eggs as she ages, but with a higher concentration of abnormal ones. On the other hand, a man produces sperm throughout his life. He experiences a slight decline in fertility as he gets older, but his semen doesn't lose its concentration. So, for men there's no age limit when it comes to fathering children, which is why it's not unusual to see older men with young kids. But for women, age plays a huge factor in the ability to get pregnant.  How are men's and women's biological clocks similar? As a woman ages, there's a decline in her body's production of the female hormone estrogen, a decline in fertility , and a higher risk that her baby will have genetic problems. As men get older they see a decline in the male hormone testosterone, a decline in fertility, and a greater chance of fathering children with genetic problems. So just because he can make sperm doesn't mean it's high-quality sperm. As men age, the volume, motility (speed), and quality of their sperm decline. A number of years ago, the journal Fertility & Sterility published one of the largest reviews of male fertility to date. The authors found that between the ages of 30 and 50, the average man's sperm declines by up to 30 percent in volume, swims up to 37 percent slower, and is five times more likely to be misshapen. Shape is important because it correlates with the sperm's genetic content. A higher number of misshapen sperm equals a greater potential for genetic abnormalities.  Are genetic problems linked to older men? Some genetic abnormalities, like dwarfism, have long been associated with paternal age, but we didn't give these problems much scientific attention because they're relatively rare. In recent years, clinical trials have found links between the father's age and more common genetically related conditions, such as Down syndrome and schizophrenia. Overall, the risk is highest when both parents are over 35. Since the number of births to parents older than 35 has more than doubled in the past two decades, this is a valid concern. A study published in the Journal of Urology found that the rate of Down syndrome births doubled among women ages 35 to 39 if their partner was also over age 35. (However, if a woman is 35 or older, odds are she's going to have an amniocentesis or CVS , either of which would detect Down syndrome.) Paternal-age risk factors aren't really an issue for women 35 and under because the ovaries have a built-in mechanism that repairs damaged DNA delivered by the sperm. But that safety net starts to break down after she turns 35.  Should older men be allowed to donate sperm? On the evidence that sperm from older men is more likely to have genetic abnormalities, some European countries have prohibited men from becoming sperm donors after they reach a certain age. But I think that as long as a man has well-shaped sperm and a good sperm count, he should be entitled to donate sperm. That said, it becomes harder and harder to meet those criteria as you get older. And even putting age aside, it's very difficult to qualify as a sperm donor. Only 5 percent of men who apply to become donors are accepted because there are so many rules and regulations. For example, if you have a tattoo or a body piercing, you're automatically disqualified because there's a chance you've been exposed to hepatitis B or C .  Does weight affect male fertility? Yes. In fact, one of the best things a man can do to protect his fertility is whittle his waist. Obesity in general is associated with male infertility . Additionally, a man's waist size is directly proportional to his testosterone level. All fat cells break down testosterone, but belly fat destroys testosterone the fastest, because visceral fat is broken down into estrogen more quickly than other types of fat. Estrogen basically cancels out testosterone in this situation – so the higher a man's waist measurement, the lower his testosterone level. Plus, men who are overweight often lead sedentary lives and have other health problems. For instance, a waist size of 40 inches or more is an independent risk factor for heart disease in men, and because heart disease slows blood flow throughout the body, what's bad for the heart is bad for the penis. If you're a man who had a 34-inch waist when you were 20 and you're at 40 inches now, you're in trouble. In most men, 5 pounds equals 1 inch around the waist. Aim for a healthy weight, but don't go overboard. Men who are too thin also struggle with low testosterone: If the body isn't getting sufficient nutrients, it often shifts into a conservation mode and produces fewer sex hormones.  What can men do to turn back their clock? The best thing about the male biological clock is that it's usually reversible. Losing weight, having an infection treated, or getting a blockage cleared up can sometimes do the trick. But you need to be tested before you can be treated. So if a couple is having problems getting pregnant, it's important for the man to see a specialist . When it comes to infertility , 40 percent of the time the problem lies with the man, in another 40 percent of cases it's the woman, and 20 percent of the time both partners have contributing factors or the cause is unknown. But male infertility is almost always easier to diagnose and remedy than female infertility, so it's always worth starting with him. One of the biggest causes of male infertility is infection in some part of the reproductive tract, such as the prostate. A low-grade infection can go undetected for years while silently damaging or killing sperm. I can't tell you how many pregnancies I've seen happen just by putting the man on antibiotics. Other common causes of male infertility are clogged ejaculatory ducts and enlarged veins in the scrotum, called varicoceles. All of these conditions are treatable.  What do other top fertility experts have to say? "We know a lot less about the male biological clock than about the female version, and for a long time men didn't want to admit it was an issue. Denial was easy because men don't have a barometer for fertility the way women have a period every month. But it's become clear that there is a hormonal decline as men get older." – Paul Shin , urologist and director of male infertility treatment at George Washington Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "The concept of a male biological clock is appropriate – as men age, their testosterone levels go down – but the change is much less dramatic than women's loss of estrogen. By age 45, 99 percent of women are infertile while most men are still fertile at age 60 and beyond. Still, men who want to conceive later in life should have a semen analysis and not assume they are fertile." – Mark Leondires , fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut "One of the best markers we have of the male biological clock is an increase in DNA-damaged sperm. At age 25, only 5 percent of a man's sperm has DNA damage; by age 35, that percentage has grown to 20 percent. That's a fourfold increase in just ten years. As the percentage of damaged sperm increases, the odds of fertilization decrease." – Narendra Singh , associate professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Washington, Seattle "Using the male biological clock to describe a man's fertility as he ages is a bad choice of words. The phrase conjures up a false sense of finality. If you look at the percentage of men over age 50 with low testosterone, it's about 15 percent. In comparison, nearly 100 percent of women over age 50 have low estrogen." – Larry Lipshultz , professor of urology and director of Male Reproductive Medicine and Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and chairman of the American Urological Association's Council on Reproductive Health Learn more: Common causes of fertility problems in men Pinpointing a fertility problem Fertility treatment: Your options at a glance     Show sources       Hide sources       ACOG.

" Zocdoc › Answers › What contributes to a man becoming sterile? Question How do men become sterile? Is it something where you?re born that way or do things that you do make you sterile? I?m 30 years old and want to have kids some day so I want to make sure I avoid anything that might cause infertility. Answer There are many reasons that a man can become sterile.  At a younger age such as yours, the most common cause of male infertility is a low sperm count.  A low sperm count is defined as a lack of the critical number of sperm per ejaculate that the man needs to make it statistically likely that he would be able to impregnate a woman.  In the vast majority of cases, we never know why a man has a low sperm count.  Because it is not known why the sperm count is low, there is little that can be done to bring it up.  Most of the time, physicians recommend wearing lose fitting undergarments as one means of increasing sperm counts, but this does not work in every case.  Other causes of infertility include certain medications.  The most common offenders are chemotherapy drugs.  Men that unfortunately develop cancer at a young age and require chemotherapy are more likely to become sterile.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.  The two of you can discuss this issue.  If you have never tried to have kids, and you don't have any risk factors for sterility, then your doctor will likely just reassure you that you should be fine.  We only test sperm counts when a couple has tried and failed to get pregnant. Need more info? See a doctor today Related questions What do three dots on the side of the penis mean?

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. [5]     Contents    1  Causes   1.1  Immune infertility  1.2  Testicular factors   1.2.1  Varicocele  1.2.2  Other    1.3  Pre-testicular causes   1.3.1  Tobacco smoking  1.3.2  DNA damage  1.3.3  Epigenetic    1.4  Post-testicular causes    2  Diagnosis   2.1  Medical history  2.2  Physical examination  2.3  Sperm sample  2.4  Blood sample  2.5  Ultrasonography    3  Prevention  4  Treatment   4.1  Hormonal therapy    5  Future potential treatments  6  See also  7  References     Causes [ edit ]  Factors relating to male infertility include: [6]  Immune infertility [ edit ]  Antisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. [7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility . [1] [2] [3] It affects approximately 7% of all men. [4] Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

[7] ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele , infections, prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. [7] [8]  Testicular factors [ edit ]  Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce sperm of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:  Varicocele [ edit ]  Varicocele , is a condition of swollen testicle veins.  It is present in 15% of normal men and in about 40% of infertile men.  It is present in up to 35% of cases of primary infertility and 69-81% of secondary infertility. [9]  Other [ edit ]   Age ( see also: Paternal age effect )  Genetic defects on the Y chromosome   Y chromosome microdeletions    Abnormal set of chromosomes  Klinefelter syndrome    Centriole [10]  Neoplasm , e.g. seminoma  Idiopathic failure  Cryptorchidism  Trauma  Hydrocele  Mumps [11]  Malaria  Testicular cancer  Defects in USP26 in some cases [12]  Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration  Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. [13]   Pre-testicular causes [ edit ]  Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to various causes  Obesity increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. [14] Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus , leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). [14]    Undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. [15] In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics , hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia , which causes impotence and loss of libido . [16] The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [15] [16] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. [17]  Drugs , alcohol  Strenuous riding ( bicycle riding , [18]  horseback riding )  Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy , anabolic steroids , cimetidine , spironolactone ; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin ; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin  Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation   Tobacco smoking [ edit ]  See also: Smoking and pregnancy  There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles [19] and kill sperm, [20] [21] but their effect on male fertility is not clear. [22] Some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes. [23]  DNA damage [ edit ]  Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. [24] As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. [25] The damage manifests by DNA fragmentation and by the increased susceptibility to denaturation upon exposure to heat or acid, the features characteristic of apoptosis of somatic cells. [26] These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.  Epigenetic [ edit ]  See also: DNA methylation  An increasing amount of recent evidence has been recorded documenting abnormal sperm DNA methylation in association with abnormal semen parameters and male infertility. [27] [28]  Post-testicular causes [ edit ]  Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation :   Vas deferens obstruction  Lack of Vas deferens , often related to genetic markers for Cystic Fibrosis  Infection , e.g. prostatitis  Retrograde ejaculation  Ejaculatory duct obstruction  Hypospadias  Impotence   Diagnosis [ edit ]  The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician , physician assistant , or nurse practitioner . Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.  Medical history [ edit ]  The history should include prior testicular or penile insults ( torsion , cryptorchidism , trauma ), infections ( mumps  orchitis , epididymitis ), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation , medications, and drug use ( anabolic steroids , alcohol , smoking ).  Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants , and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.  Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor .  The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy ( retrograde ejaculation ), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).  A family history may reveal genetic problems.  Physical examination [ edit ]  Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis , scrotum , testicles , I vas deferens , spermatic cords , ejaculatory ducts , urethra , urinary bladder , anus and rectum . An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. [4] A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a varicocele , but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a varicocele on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated. [4]  Sperm sample [ edit ]  Main article: Semen analysis  Further information: Semen quality  The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. [29] [30] Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:   Oligo spermia or Oligozoo spermia - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen  A spermia - complete lack of semen  Hypo spermia - reduced seminal volume  Azoo spermia - absence of sperm cells in semen  Terato spermia - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology  Asthenozoo spermia - reduced sperm motility  Necrozoo spermia - all sperm in the ejaculate are dead  Leuco spermia - a high level of white blood cells in semen  Normozoo spermia or Normo spermia - It is a result of semen analysis that shows normal values of all ejaculate parameters by WHO but still there are chances of being infertile. This is also called as Unexplained Infertility [31]   There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Teratoasthenozoospermia , which is reduced sperm morphology and motility. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a catch-all .  Blood sample [ edit ]  Common hormonal test include determination of FSH and testosterone levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Klinefelter syndrome , a Y chromosome microdeletion , or cystic fibrosis .  Ultrasonography [ edit ]  Scrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis , which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer . [4] Scrotum ultrasonography may also detect testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testicular vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia . [4]  Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele , when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. [4]  Dilation of the head or tail of the epididymis is suggestive of obstruction or inflammation of the male reproductive tract . [4] Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. [4] Scrotal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are useful in detecting uni- or bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with abnormalities or agenesis of the epididymis, seminal vesicles or kidneys, and indicate the need for testicular sperm extraction . [4] TRUS plays a key role in assessing azoospermia caused by obstruction, and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct , such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. [4]  Prevention [ edit ]  Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:   Avoiding smoking [32] as it damages sperm DNA  Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. [33]  Avoiding excessive heat to the testes. [33]  Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity [33] and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). [33]  Wearing a protective cup and jockstrap to protect the testicles, in any sport such as baseball , football , cricket , lacrosse , hockey , softball , paintball , rodeo , motorcross , wrestling , soccer , karate or other martial arts or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.  Diet: Healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vitamins, and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are inversely associated with low semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecundability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This association is only controversial in the case of alcohol. The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm function and fertility are largely unknown and require further study. [34]   Treatment [ edit ]  Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.  Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions.  Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.  Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF.  Vitamin E helps counter oxidative stress, [35] which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. [36] A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. [37] However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility result in higher live birth rate . [38] It is unclear if there are any adverse effects. [38]  Hormonal therapy [ edit ]  See also: Spermatogenesis § Hormonal control  Administration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin ) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . [39] Although controversial, [40] off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen , may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels. [39]  Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. [41] This is thought to be because very high local levels of testosterone in the testes (concentrations in the seminiferous tubules are 20- to 100-fold greater than circulating levels) [42] are required to mediate spermatogenesis, and exogenous testosterone therapy (which is administered systemically) cannot achieve these required high local concentrations (at least not without extremely supraphysiological dosages). [41] Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland , as seen in users of androgens/ anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). [39] [41] This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) [39] [41] and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. [43] [44] In contrast to FSH, LH has little role in male fertility outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production. [45]  Estrogen , at some concentration, has been found to be essential for male fertility/spermatogenesis. [46] [47] However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. [41] As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen ) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. [41]  Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, [48] including in men with severe oligospermia. [49]  Future potential treatments [ edit ]  Researchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis , including spermatozoa generation. [50] If reproduced in humans, this could potentially enable infertile men to father children with their own sperm . [51] [52]  Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. [53] [54] [55]  Sharpe et al comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."

This means they aren't able to conceive a child even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer. In up to half of these couples, male infertility plays a role.  Male infertility is due to low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors can play a role in causing male infertility.  Not being able to conceive a child can be stressful and frustrating, but a number of male infertility treatments are available.      Symptoms The main sign of male infertility is the inability to conceive a child. There may be no other obvious signs or symptoms. In some cases, however, an underlying problem such as an inherited disorder, hormonal imbalance, dilated veins around the testicle, or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm causes signs and symptoms.  Although most men with male infertility do not notice symptoms other than inability to conceive a child, signs and symptoms associated with male infertility include:   Problems with sexual function — for example, difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of fluid ejaculated, reduced sexual desire or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction)  Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area  Recurrent respiratory infections  Inability to smell  Abnormal breast growth (gynecomastia)  Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosomal or hormonal abnormality  Having a lower than normal sperm count (fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or a total sperm count of less than 39 million per ejaculate)   When to see a doctor  See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following:   Have erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function  Have pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area  Have a history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems  Have had groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Male fertility is a complex process. To get your partner pregnant, the following must occur:   You must produce healthy sperm. Initially, this involves the growth and formation of the male reproductive organs during puberty. At least one of your testicles must be functioning correctly, and your body must produce testosterone and other hormones to trigger and maintain sperm production.  Sperm have to be carried into the semen. Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis.  There needs to be enough sperm in the semen. If the number of sperm in your semen (sperm count) is low, it decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg. A low sperm count is fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or fewer than 39 million per ejaculate.  Sperm must be functional and able to move. If the movement (motility) or function of your sperm is abnormal, the sperm may not be able to reach or penetrate your partner's egg.   Medical causes  Problems with male fertility can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments. Some of these include:    Varicocele. A varicocele is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility. Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it may be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation. Varicoceles result in reduced quality of the sperm.  Treating the varicocele can improve sperm numbers and function, and may potentially improve outcomes when using assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization.   Infection. Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm. These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV. Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved.   Ejaculation issues. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out the tip of the penis. Various health conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, medications, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra.  Some men with spinal cord injuries or certain diseases can't ejaculate semen, even though they still produce sperm. Often in these cases sperm can still be retrieved for use in assisted reproductive techniques.   Antibodies that attack sperm. Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to eliminate them.  Tumors. Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes. In some cases, surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can affect male fertility.  Undescended testicles. In some males, during fetal development one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum). Decreased fertility is more likely in men who have had this condition.  Hormone imbalances. Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves or an abnormality affecting other hormonal systems including the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands. Low testosterone (male hypogonadism) and other hormonal problems have a number of possible underlying causes.   Defects of tubules that transport sperm. Many different tubes carry sperm. They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions.  Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra.   Chromosome defects. Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome — in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (instead of one X and one Y) — cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs. Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann's syndrome and Kartagener's syndrome.  Problems with sexual intercourse. These can include trouble keeping or maintaining an erection sufficient for sex (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse, anatomical abnormalities such as having a urethral opening beneath the penis (hypospadias), or psychological or relationship problems that interfere with sex.  Celiac disease. A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility. Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet.  Certain medications. Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), certain antifungal medications, some ulcer drugs and certain other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility.  Prior surgeries. Certain surgeries may prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others. In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockage or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles.   Environmental causes  Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm production or sperm function. Specific causes include:     Industrial chemicals. Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead may contribute to low sperm counts.  Heavy metal exposure. Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also may cause infertility.  Radiation or X-rays. Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production, though it will often eventually return to normal. With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced.   Overheating the testicles. Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function. Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs may temporarily impair your sperm count.  Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also may increase the temperature in your scrotum and may slightly reduce sperm production.    Health, lifestyle and other causes  Some other causes of male infertility include:   Illicit drug use. Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. Use of cocaine or marijuana may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well.  Alcohol use. Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels, cause erectile dysfunction and decrease sperm production. Liver disease caused by excessive drinking also may lead to fertility problems.  Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. Secondhand smoke also may affect male fertility.  Emotional stress. Stress can interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm. Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including problems with fertility, can affect your sperm count.  Weight. Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm themselves as well as by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.   Certain occupations including welding or those involving prolonged sitting, such as truck driving, may be associated with a risk of infertility. However, the research to support these links is mixed.  Risk factors Risk factors linked to male infertility include:   Smoking tobacco  Using alcohol  Using certain illicit drugs  Being overweight  Having certain past or present infections  Being exposed to toxins  Overheating the testicles  Having experienced trauma to the testicles  Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery  Having a history of undescended testicles  Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder  Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses, such as sickle cell disease  Taking certain medications or undergoing medical treatments, such as surgery or radiation used for treating cancer   Complications Infertility can be stressful for both you and your partner. Complications of male infertility can include:   Surgery or other procedures to treat an underlying cause of low sperm count or other reproductive problems  Expensive and involved reproductive techniques  Stress and relationship difficulties related to the inability to have a child   Prevention Many types of male infertility aren't preventable. However, you can avoid some known causes of male infertility. For example:   Don't smoke.  Limit or abstain from alcohol.  Steer clear of illicit drugs.  Keep the weight off.  Don't get a vasectomy.  Avoid things that lead to prolonged heat for the testicles.  Reduce stress.  Avoid exposure to pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins.

Reproduction (or making a baby) is a simple and natural experience for most couples. However, for some couples it is very difficult to conceive.  A man’s fertility generally relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm. If the number of sperm a man ejaculates is low or if the sperm are of a poor quality, it will be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for him to cause a pregnancy.  Male infertility is diagnosed when, after testing both partners, reproductive problems have been found in the male.  How common is male infertility?  Infertility is a widespread problem. For about one in five infertile couples the problem lies solely in the male partner.  It is estimated that one in 20 men has some kind of fertility problem with low numbers of sperm in his ejaculate. However, only about one in every 100 men has no sperm in his ejaculate.  What are the symptoms of male infertility?  In most cases, there are no obvious signs of infertility. Intercourse, erections and ejaculation will usually happen without difficulty. The quantity and appearance of the ejaculated semen generally appears normal to the naked eye.  Medical tests are needed to find out if a man is infertile.  What causes male infertility?  Male infertility is usually caused by problems that affect either sperm production or sperm transport. Through medical testing, the doctor may be able to find the cause of the problem.  About two-thirds of infertile men have a problem with making sperm in the testes. Either low numbers of sperm are made and/or the sperm that are made do not work properly.  Sperm transport problems are found in about one in every five infertile men, including men who have had a vasectomy but now wish to have more children. Blockages (often referred to as obstructions) in the tubes leading sperm away from the testes to the penis can cause a complete lack of sperm in the ejaculated semen.  Other less common causes of infertility include: sexual problems that affect whether semen is able to enter the woman’s vagina for fertilisation to take place (one in 100 infertile couples); low levels of hormones made in the pituitary gland that act on the testes (one in 100 infertile men); and sperm antibodies (found in one in 16 infertile men). In most men sperm antibodies will not affect the chance of a pregnancy but in some men sperm antibodies reduce fertility.  Known causes of male infertility     Sperm production problems • Chromosomal or genetic causes • Undescended testes (failure of the testes to descend at birth) • Infections • Torsion (twisting of the testis in scrotum) • Varicocele (varicose veins of the testes) • Medicines and chemicals • Radiation damage • Unknown cause    Blockage of sperm transport • Infections • Prostate-related problems • Absence of vas deferens • Vasectomy    Sexual problems (erection and ejaculation problems) • Retrograde and premature ejaculation • Failure of ejaculation • Erectile dysfunction • Infrequent intercourse • Spinal cord injury • Prostate surgery • Damage to nerves • Some medicines    Hormonal problems • Pituitary tumours • Congenital lack of LH/FSH (pituitary problem from birth) • Anabolic (androgenic) steroid abuse    Sperm antibodies • Vasectomy • Injury or infection in the epididymis • Unknown cause      The male reproductive system  The male reproductive system is made up of the testes, a system of ducts (tubes) and other glands that open into the ducts. The brain plays an important part in the control of the male reproductive system.  A side view showing the main parts of the male reproductive system  The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain, control the production of male hormones and sperm. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are the two important messenger hormones made by the pituitary gland that act on the testes.  Two messenger hormones act on the testes  The testes (testis: singular) are a pair of egg-shaped glands that sit in the scrotum next to the base of the penis on the outside of the body. The testes make sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. It takes about 70 days for sperm to become mature and able to fertilise an egg.  When released from the testes, the sperm spend two to 10 days passing through the epididymis where they gain the vital ability to swim strongly (become ‘motile’), and to attach to and penetrate (get into) the egg.  At orgasm, waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm, with a small amount of fluid, from the testes through to the vas deferens. The seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. This mixture of sperm and fluid (the semen) travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is ejaculated (released).     Diagnosis  How is male infertility diagnosed?  If a couple has been trying for a pregnancy without success, they should go to their local doctor, family planning clinic or women’s health clinic, and have some initial tests. Both partners should be tested, even if one has a child from another relationship. Diagnosis can involve a medical history from the man and a physical examination along with a semen analysis to check the number, shape and movement of sperm in the ejaculate.  Blood tests may also be done to check the levels of hormones that control sperm production. Genetic investigations and testicular biopsies are sometimes done.    Treatment  How is male infertility treated?  One in eight infertile men has a treatable condition, and after treatment, couples can become pregnant naturally.  In some cases, the doctor will recommend that the couple seek assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as IVF (in vitro fertilisation). ART do not cure or treat the cause of infertility but they can help couples achieve a pregnancy, even if the man’s sperm count is very low.  What is ICSI?  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a form of IVF where a single sperm is placed directly into each egg by piercing the outer covering of the egg. ICSI is particularly helpful for men with poor sperm production. Sperm are collected from the semen or removed carefully from the testis or epididymis.  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)  ICSI can achieve pregnancies even when only a few sperm are produced.  As for IVF, after fertilisation the resulting embryos are then placed into the woman’s uterus.    Management & support  Can I do anything to prevent male infertility?  It is best to avoid cigarette smoking, excess alcohol, sexually transmitted infections, heat stress from tight fitting underwear, and anabolic steroids (taken for body building or sporting purposes) as these factors can be harmful to the production of sperm.  If you work in an occupation that may affect your fertility, it’s important to wear protective clothing and follow all occupational health and safety guidelines. It is recommended that couples trying to conceive avoid exposure to any possibly harmful chemicals.  Because of the possible effects on fertility, it’s important to tell your doctor if you have had hormone treatment or had surgery as a child to move your testes into the scrotum.  Can older age cause male fertility problems?  Healthy men in their 70s and beyond can still father children, however the time taken for a partner to become pregnant is longer when a man is middle-aged or older. Reasons for this may include a decrease in sexual activity, lower semen volume, changes to sperm motility (movement), a lower number of motile sperm, and possibly lower sperm function and DNA quality.  The chance of the child having some genetic or chromosomal problem is also increased for older men.  What emotions might a man experience when diagnosed with infertility?  Men may be shocked when they find out they are infertile. There is still a common but incorrect belief that infertility is a woman’s problem. Therefore, when men are told there is a sperm problem, they are often unprepared.  Being told that there is a sperm problem can affect a man’s sense of masculinity, sexuality and potency. Most infertile men at some time struggle with the idea that they are not able to do what other men can.  An emotional response to infertility is normal. Talking with a doctor or a sexual therapist or counsellor can help some men with their feelings about infertility.

Christopher L. Starks, MD on behalf of StoneSprings Hospital Center    Urology         In this video, Christopher Starks, MD from StoneSprings Hospital Center, says that about 40 percent of infertility is attributable to the male.                     Univ. of Nev. School of Medicine, Family Medicine    Family Medicine         Infertility is defined as a couple being unable to become pregnant after 1 year of regular intercourse without contraception. Infertility is a very complex problem and can be due to many different causes affecting either the male or female. One study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that infertility was due to female causes 37% of the time, male causes 8% of the time, and both 35% of the time. The initial evaluation for a male who is concerned about infertility commonly includes semen analysis to evaluate the number of sperm and, oftentimes, their quality.                   Erika Tabke on behalf of Honor Society of Nursing (STTI)    Nursing         Infertility is equally attributable to both the male and female partners. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, about 40% of infertility cases are due to male factors, about 40% are due to female factors, and the remaining 20% are either a combination of both partners' factors or are unknown/unexplained. Infertility is neither partners' "fault" - it is simply a medical issue that couples must face together. It is estimated that 12% of the population or one in eight couples of reproductive age are affected by infertility.

From a man's point of view, starting a family is easy. While women are on the job for nine months, men can often complete the task in a single evening. When it comes time to try for a pregnancy, they just naturally assume that it will happen. But among the couples who try unsuccessfully for months or even years to get pregnant, about half the time the problem lies either with both partners or with the man.  In the past, women nearly always took the blame when couples failed to conceive. Today we know that fertility is a two-person job. If a woman doesn't get pregnant after more than a year of trying, there's a 30 to 40 percent chance that her partner's fertility problem may play a role, according to a report in the Journal of Urology. Many men don't produce enough sperm, and the sperm they make may be too slow or oddly shaped. Without a few billion sleek, powerful swimmers working on a guy's behalf, fatherhood can be a difficult destination.  A treatable condition  Fortunately, male infertility is often temporary and treatable, says Larry Lipshultz, chief of the division of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine. If a couple has trouble conceiving, both partners should be evaluated by a urologist or a reproductive endocrinologist who specializes in fertility problems, he says. Even men who've fathered children in the past should get a checkup, he says.  For the man, the search for answers will start with a semen analysis. Typically, a doctor will check at least two samples collected a month apart. If a man's samples contain large amounts of active, normal-looking sperm, chances are he's fertile. But if anything seems out of the ordinary, he'll need a thorough physical exam and lab work to get to the root of the problem.  Men may be reluctant to see a doctor for such a personal matter, but they have strong incentives to get help, Lipshultz says. For one thing, a doctor may find a solution for their infertility. At the other end of the spectrum -- and more rarely -- a doctor may determine that biological fatherhood will be impossible, a finding that could help a couple avoid years of frustration and costly fertility treatments. There's another reason to get help, Lipschultz says. In roughly 2 percent of all cases, male infertility is a symptom of a life-threatening disease such as testicular cancer. If a man ignores his fertility problems, he can lose more than a chance for fatherhood.  Most infertile men have reason for optimism. In a study described in Postgraduate Medicine, 76 percent of men who sought treatment for fertility problems had a potentially correctable condition. Among the men who underwent treatment, 32 percent fathered a child without any other medical help, and another 43 percent showed improvement in the number or quality of their sperm.  Blockages in various parts of the sperm pathway are a common, treatable cause of male infertility. These blockages often occur as a result of infections, including the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and gonorrhea. In many cases, surgery can remove the obstruction and get the sperm back on their way. Another form of obstruction is "congenital absence of the vas deferens," common in men who have cystic fibrosis. Other potentially treatable causes of infertility include hormone imbalances, inflammation in the urinary system (including prostatitis and urethritis), and retrograde ejaculation, a condition in which semen flows into the bladder.  Some experts say that varicose veins or "varicoceles," in the testicles can lead to male infertility. As reported in Postgraduate Medicine, these twisted, enlarged veins may hamper sperm production, and the effect tends to get worse over time. "The sooner these can be diagnosed and treated, the better the results," Lipshultz says. A number of doctors assert that surgical repair of the vessels can improve sperm counts and boost the odds of pregnancy, but others say the link between varicoceles and infertility isn't firmly established.  Sometimes a man's hobbies can interfere with infertility. According to a small study conducted in Austria, frequent mountain biking may contribute to a man's infertility. The study looked at 55 avid mountain bikers and found that nearly 90 percent had low sperm counts and abnormalities in their scrotums. In contrast, only 26 percent of 35 non-bike riders had similar damage.  The study, presented at an annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, suggests that the frequent jolts and vibration associated with riding over rough terrain may be to blame. Infertility problems were most common in frequent bike riders who rode about 60 miles a week.  If there's no clear physical explanation for infertility, it's time to take a close look at what a man puts in his body. As reported in Postgraduate Medicine, some common prescription drugs can hamper sperm production. It's important to tell your doctor all the drugs you've been taking. The list of potential culprits includes the heartburn medication cimetidine (Tagamet), the rheumatoid arthritis drug sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), and several chemotherapy drugs. In some cases, a change in a prescription can restore fertility. Likewise, a man may be able to give his sperm a boost by avoiding cigarettes and going easy on alcohol. Heavy drinking can lead to a decrease in sperm count and movement, and smoking harms sperm's motility (ability to move). He should also stay away from recreational drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids.  Stress, obesity, malnutrition, radiation, major surgery, and overexposure to heat, chemicals, and poisons in the environment may also affect fertility. Pesticides with effects similar to those of estrogen have been linked strongly to a drop in sperm production, as has the insecticide DBCP.  Father-friendly tips  If a man tells friends and relatives about his fertility troubles, it often unleashes an avalanche of advice -- some good, some bad. Almost invariably, someone will tell him he needs to wear loose pants and boxer shorts. This common belief is still being debated in the medical community, as studies on the impact of tight-fitting underwear on scrotal temperature are contradictory. Someone else might suggest an herbal "fertility" remedy. There's no evidence that these will take a man any closer to fatherhood, according to a report from the University of Iowa -- and worse, some herbal remedies could be harmful. Since herbs aren't tested for safety and efficacy, as prescription drugs are, men should talk with their doctors before experimenting with any supplement.  Some pieces of common wisdom actually turn out to be true. According to a report from the Mayo Clinic, a man trying to start a family really should stay clear of hot tubs or saunas: The sperm factories in the testicles don't work well under high temperatures. A Stony Brook University Hospital study found that men may also be feeling the heat from another direction -- laptop computers. Researchers found that holding a laptop computer on a man's lap for only an hour raised his testes temperature by 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit, which might be enough to impair fertility. Further research is needed to confirm the findings, say researchers.  Other options  Even if a man takes all the right steps and gets the best treatment possible, he may still be unable to father a child the "old-fashioned" way. But as long as he produces at least a few healthy sperm, there's still hope.  In a procedure known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), doctors collect a single sperm and inject it directly into a woman's egg in a laboratory dish. After fertilization, the embryo is implanted in the woman's uterus. According to the CDC, about 32 percent of ICSI procedures resulted in live births in 2007. In women under 35, pregnancy rates can be 60 percent or higher. Unfortunately, one cycle of ICSI costs from $10,000 to $20,000 -- a high price for a procedure with no guarantees.  After consulting with doctors and, more importantly, with each other, many couples decide not to try such measures. They may turn to a sperm bank or an adoption agency, or decide on a life without children. Some feelings of disappointment are inevitable, but at least they can get off the emotional roller-coaster they experienced month after month.  As easy as it seems, fatherhood isn't for everyone. It only comes to men who are either naturally fertile or willing to take action. A growing number of men are finding the courage to make that first call to the doctor. Their spouses are grateful -- and their children will be too.

In 2006 she began channeling her knowledge into health-related articles for print and online publications. Her work has appeared in "Metroparent Magazine," "Anew Heart Healthcare Magazine" and community newspapers. Lewis earned a diploma from LongRidge Writers Institute.            Signs of Sterility in Males          When a couple is unable to conceive after a year of unprotected sex, infertility is likely the problem. Men are as likely to be sterile as women are, according to the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. Certain factors can raise the risks of sterility in males. Habits like smoking, drinking and drugs or alcohol are considered chemical causes of sterility. Other factors that might lead to sterility are stress and poor nutrition. If these causes have been ruled out, testicular, hormonal, ejaculatory or sperm transport problems may be the cause.   Video of the Day             Testicles  The testicles are important components in fertility. They are small, oval-shaped organs that produce testosterone and sperm. Testosterone is a hormone responsible for male characteristics like facial hair and a low voice. It is crucial to erections and libido. Sperm is necessary for fertilizing female eggs. When testicular problems exist, signs like masses on the scrotum, one smaller testicle and little or no sperm might exist. These issues can cause sterility in males. In addition, slightly enlarged breast tissue or undescended testicles are other signs. Testicles that have not naturally descended into the scrotum decrease fertility and can increase the likelihood of cancer, according to the National Library of Medicine.            Ejaculatory Problems  A male's inability to ejaculate could be the cause of sterility. Ejaculation occurs when an orgasm is achieved and sperm is propelled into a woman's vagina and on to her uterus, where sperm search for eggs to implant. Ejaculatory problems can cause sterility in males. Symptoms that indicate a problem include trouble achieving or maintaining an erection, orgasms that do not result in excretion of semen and unusual urination symptoms. After an orgasm, if urine appears milky or white, ejaculation problems could be the cause.  Hormonal Problems  Hormonal problems are not just a women's issue. Men also have various hormones in their body that can fluctuate and impede normal functions. Factors that affect a male's hormone levels can result in sterility. Clues that indicate such problems include blurred vision, small or soft testicles, impotence, changes in hair growth patterns, voice changes, insomnia, irritability, muscle weakness and advanced maturation in boys. If these or any of the above signs are present, check with your doctor or seek help from a fertility specialist.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

Not anymore. Older dads are more likely to pass on genetic mutations to their offspring than older mums, according to research. And studies show that male infertility is behind half of all cases where couples fail to conceive after one year. Sperm counts in men worldwide have declined by half over the past 50 years and are continuing to fall. Here, in a piece for The Hippocratic Post , a range of experts reveal 23 things that could be diminishing your partner's supply - and what can be done to prevent it. Scroll down for video          Sperm counts in men worldwide have declined by more than half over the past 50 years. But there are plenty of ways that men can optimise their quantity and quality The average European sperm count is in the region of 70 million per millilitre. According to the World Health Organisation, a man needs a sperm count of at least 20 million sperm per millilitre of ejaculate to have a chance of conceiving a child without medical intervention. Sperm, which are the swimming cells that carry a male's DNA, are continually produced in the testicles at the rate of up to 100 million every day.

It then takes a further 10 to 14 days for the sperm to pass through the epididymis, which is where they mature, before they can leave the body via ejaculation. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways that men can optimise the quantity and quality of their sperm. BIOLOGICAL CLOCK          Studies have shown that men's fertility starts to decline after the age of 35 Men have a biological clock just like women. Studies have shown that men's fertility starts to decline after the age of 35 and female partners, regardless of their own age, have less chance of getting pregnant. One French study, published in published in the journal Fertility and Sterility in 2005, found that women younger than 30 years old was 25 per cent less likely to conceive a baby if her male partner was 40 years or older. A woman aged 35 to 37 years was 50 per cent less likely to conceive if the male partner was over 40 years old. Studies have shown that the genes contained in the sperm of older men have a greater chance of being abnormal. A study at the University of California, Berkeley found that the sperm of older men were less mobile and less able to move in a straight line. Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, says: 'We have known for some time that children of older fathers have a higher risk of being born with a range of genetically linked diseases such as Down's syndrome, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders among others. 'There is also evidence that as men get older their partner is at increased risk of infertility and miscarriage because of genetic changes which are evident in his sperm.' WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT You can't turn back the clock and the age of first time fathers in the UK is rising steadily to 32 compared to 27 in 1980. However, perhaps it is time for a rethink, according to Dr Pacey who points out that men over the age of 40 are advised against donating sperm. 'Whilst not wanting to scare the children of older fathers, information like this is important to understand and should remind us that nature designed us to have our children at a young age and if at all possible men and women should not delay parenthood if they are in a position not to.' TIGHT UNDERWEAR          Close-fitting underwear is going to hinder your chance of conceiving a child, as modeled by ex-footballer David Beckham, experts say Male models – and footballer David Beckham – may look great in tight designer briefs, but close-fitting underwear is going to hinder your chance of conceiving a child. That's the conclusion of a large-scale study of 2500 men published in the journal Human Reproduction in June 2012 by researchers at the University of Sheffield and the University of Manchester. Dr Allan Pacey, one of the lead researchers, explains: 'What we found is that the single biggest lifestyle factor affecting sperm count was tight underwear.' The reason is probably related to underwear pulling the testicles closer to the body, reducing air circulation and causing the temperature of inside the testes to rise. 'The scrotum sac hangs outside the body for a reason because testes work at an optimum temperature of around 35 degrees centigrade, or two degrees cooler than body temperature,' says Dr Pacey. Testes that are too hot produce less sperm because the seminferous epithelium, which lines the tubules where cell division takes place, is sensitive to elevated temperatures. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'Switch to boxer shorts and trousers which have room over the groin,' says Dr Pacey. 'Skinny jeans and tight cycling shorts probably have the same negative effect although we did not investigate this in our study.' It will take three months to bring fertility levels back to normal. 'This is how long the body takes to produce a sperm cell from the beginning to the end of the process,' explains Dr Pacey. UNDESCENDED TESTICLE          Testicles that remain inside the body and have not come down into the scrotal sac will not be producing viable sperm (stock) This is a common problem that occurs in 3-4 per cent of full term infants but it usually resolves itself before a child is a year old. Occasionally, a male may reach adulthood with the problem still unresolved. Testicles that remain inside the body and have not come down into the scrotal sac will not be producing viable sperm. They are considered abnormal and are also more prone to becoming cancerous. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT If the testes does not descend on its own, surgeons may perform an operation called an orchiopexy to bring the testes down and stitch it in place within the scrotum. 'Occasionally, this procedure can be carried out on adolescents or adult males and is usually successful,' says Dr Pacey. CANCER TREATMENT          Radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can also impair sperm production 'Men who have undergone cancer treatment may find that their fertility has been affected,' says Dr Mike Bowen, a consultant gynaecologist based in Oxford. In particular, up to 70 per cent of men who have prostate cancer and have undergone a radical prostatectomy will not be able to maintain an erection after surgery, according to Cancer Research UK. Radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can also impair sperm production. If radiation is focused on or near the pelvic area, abdomen, spine, and/or the whole body, it may reduce sperm count and motility in boys — these conditions may be permanent or may reverse after the treatment if sperm production recovers. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 'In many cases, specialists may advise patients to freeze sperm for future use,' says Dr Bowen. 'Men who have erectile dysfunction may be helped by the drug Viagra.' Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely to lead to permanent infertility than others. The high-risk drugs most likely to affect reproductive organs are Cytoxan, Ifosfamide, Procarbazine, Busulfan, and Melphalan. Others, like vincristine and methotrexate, are typically less likely to harm fertility. BEING ILL          Being ill can affect male fertility, but experts say further research is needed to determine why A huge number of illnesses can affect male fertility. Cardiovascular disease, which affects blood circulation, can lead to impotence and failure to maintain an erection. Diabetes, when the body cannot control blood sugar levels and its complications, is another major cause of impotence. A body of research shows that sperm produced by a man with diabetes are more damaged than those from a non-diabetic and less able to fertilise an egg. Further studies are needed in order to determine why this happens and the extent of the problem. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the primary way to minimise your risk of disease and alleviate symptoms of established health problems. Statins are drugs which can help control the complications of cardiovascular disease and may also have a role to play in disease prevention. Control your diabetes through diet and exercise and medication. RANGE OF MEDICATIONS          Some medications may act to decrease male sexual interest in intercourse, or libido. Others may interfere with the ability of a man to get an erection or ejaculate 'Many different types of medication can affect male fertility through different ways,' says Dr Jane Stewart. Some, like the antiobiotic erythromycin, are toxic to the testicles and damage cells that produce sperm – sometimes permanently. Others work indirectly, interrupting hormonal signals that stimulate the cells in the testicles which can result in lower sperm counts, like antipsychotic drugs and trycyclic anti-depressants. Some medications may act to decrease male sexual interest in intercourse, or libido. Other medications may interfere with the ability of a man to get an erection or ejaculate. The antiobiotic tetracycline can block fertilisation. Calcium channel blockers, which are used to treat high blood pressure, have been shown in some studies to block the ability of the sperm to fertilize an egg. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 'This is a question of weighing up your options and discussing them with your doctor,' says consultant gynaecologist Dr Mike Bowen. 'It may be that the risk of in fertility is outweighed by the benefit of the drug. Or there may be an alternative medication which will not have this affect.' SUFFERING FROM VARIOCELE          Variocele, which leads to abnormally dilated veins around the testicles, is one of the most common causes of male infertility Variocele, which leads to abnormally dilated veins around the testicles, is one of the most common causes of male infertility because it increases the temperature of the scrotum. The testes work most effectively at 35 degrees centigrade – two degrees cooler than the rest of the body. Around 15 per cent of the male population has variocele and 40 per cent of men diagnosed with infertility have this condition. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) on over 9,000 men showed that varicocele are commonly accompanied by decreased testicular volume and impaired sperm quality. Varicoceles which are untreated cause more damage to the testicles as time goes on. WHAT YOU CAN DO Surgery to tie off the damaged veins not only halts decline in testicular function but often reverses it. Around 80 per cent of men who undergo the surgery will have improved quality and quantity of sperm. Recent studies also show that female partners of men who have undergone the operation are more likely to get pregnant. BLOCKED DUCTS          Infections, particularly chlamydia and gonnorrhea, can lead to blockages of the tubes which carry the sperm from the testes through the penis Blocked ducts are an obvious mechanical cause of male infertility. When sperm is almost fully formed, it is stored in two coiled tubes called the epididymides to mature. At the point of ejaculation it moves from the epididymides to the vas deferens where it is expelled from the penis. Infections, particularly chlamydia and gonnorrhea, can lead to blockages of the tubes which carry the sperm from the testes through the penis. A blockage can also be caused by an inherited defect or a groin injury. WHAT YOU CAN DO If you play contact sports, wear groin protection. Avoid sexually transmitted infections which can lead to duct blockage. 'If you suspect you have a sexually transmitted infection, go to see your doctor for advice and early treatment,' says Mr Mike Bowen. STAYING FIT          It is important to stay fit and exercise regularly if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child, experts say Staying fit and healthy and exercising regularly is important if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child. However, men and women who exercise too much can impair their natural fertility. 'There is evidence that some endurance trained men can affect their reproductive hormone profile, in particular reducing their testosterone levels,' says Mr Bowen. 'However, there is no direct evidence that this results in male infertility.' Cycling is becoming more popular both as a recreation and a means of beating commuter traffic, but too much cycling can lead to impotence, according to Vinod Nargund, a consultant urological surgeon at St Bartholomew's and Homerton Hospitals London. This is because of prolonged pressure from the saddle on the perineum, which is the area of skin behind the scrotum. This is where nerves and blood vessels enter the penis. Studies on volunteers have shown that cycling in a standing position does not alter penile blood supply after exercise and remain the same as before exercise. Numbness of the genital region is reported by more than 60 per cent of the cyclists. There is a higher incidence of numbness and erectile problems in men who cycle regularly on longer training distances. Penile blood flow is affected due to the compression of vessels by sitting on the saddle. WHAT YOU CAN DO Try a softer saddle and stand up to pedal. 'Studies on volunteers have shown that cycling in a standing position does not alter penile blood supply after exercise and remain the same as before exercise,' says Mr Nargund. 'It is important therefore to take rests intermittently during prolonged and vigorous bicycle riding and to restrict the training distance. BEING OVERLY HOT          Anything that raises the temperature of the testicles is going to have a temporary impact on sperm production Anything that raises the temperature of your testicles is going to have a temporary impact on sperm production, even sitting on a crowded commuter train for long periods in a heatwave. Frequent use of hot tubs or saunas may lower your sperm count, according to studies. Spending more than 30 minutes at a time in water heated to 40 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) or more may lower the sperm count significantly. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'Avoid saunas and hot tubs if you are trying to conceive and any other situation where you feel very hot for prolonged periods of time,' says Mike Bowen. FREQUENT SELF-PLEASURE 'Forget the myth that stored sperm goes stale and needs to be refreshed,' says Dr Pacey. 'If you masturbate frequently, you reduce the volume of sperm held in storage and the quantity available when you ejaculate inside your partner.' Studies have shown that ejaculating more than twice a day can have a negative effect on male fertility. Every man is different. Although the average ejaculate contains around 40 million sperm, many men have sperm counts far lower, closer to the 'fertility minimum' set by the World Health Organisation of 20 million sperm per one millilitre of ejaculate. If they masturbate too often, their sperm count could fall below this. Conversely, it can be as high as 100 million per ejaculate. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'If you want to have a maximise your chances of having a baby, you should be having sex with you partner two or three times a week. 'This is the ideal amount to have maximum number of sperm entering your partner's body,' says Dr Jane Stewart, consultant in reproductive medicine at Newcastle Fertility Centre. Any more than this and the volume of ejaculate will be reduced. And limit masturbation until after conception has occurred. A period of total abstinence of 3-5 days should bring levels up to their maximum, according to Dr Pacey. NOT HAVING ENOUGH SEX          A lack of sexual relations is one of the leading causes of failing to conceive a child One of the leading causes of failing to conceive a child is actually lack of sexual relations. And stress plays a major role in turning people off the idea. Stress reduces male fertility in two ways. Firstly, stress hormones like cortisol seem to have an effect on the way that men ejaculate, according to research. High cortisol levels have a dampening effect on testosterone, which in turn lowers the quantity and quality of sperm. If stress is chronic, this can become a long-term problem. 'Stress also has an important negative effect on libido and the desire to have sex in the first place,' says Dr Jane Stewart. 'Men who are stressed may not be able to get an erection at all because of physiological effects of lower levels of testosterone circulating in the body and the psychological effects which are critical to creating desire in the first place.' In fact, 15 per cent of men experience decreased libido because of stress, while 5 per cent of men experience impotence because of it. WHAT YOU CAN DO If stress is reduced, either by taking up meditation or improving work/life balance, the effect on fertility should be reversed almost immediately. Failure to conceive can be an important cause of stress which is why it helps to be relaxed and not too focus on the goal of having a child. LACK OF VITAMIN D          Getting enough UV rays is key to the health of sperm, according to research eight years ago Vitamin D – the sunshine vitamin – is essential to sperm health. In 2006, it was found that human sperm had multiple Vitamin D receptors on its head and nucleus, suggesting that the cell needs this vitamin to function. Getting enough UV rays is key to the health of male sperm, according to research presented to the Fertility Society of Australia conference in 2008. Laura Thomson, a doctoral student from University of Sydney found that vitamin D deficiency – caused by too little sun exposure – played a a significant role in determining male fertility. Thomson's study involved screening 794 men who attended the same fertility clinic in Sydney in Australia. Nearly a third, which is similar to the average, were found to suffer from too little Vitamin D which is synthesised in the skin during exposure to sunlight. A group of 123 of the vitamin D deficient men in the Australian study were followed for 3 months as they took vitamin D containing multivitamin supplements, antioxidants and lost weight. Follow-up tests showed improvements in sperm shape and a 75 per cent drop in sperm DNA fragmentation, when the DNA is damaged. In a quarter of these men, pregnancy was successful. WHAT YOU CAN DO Go easy on sunscreen when you are out and about not in the heat of the day, between 11am and 3pm. Just rolling up your sleeves in your lunch break while outdoors should be enough to help your skin create enough Vitamin D from sunshine. The effects on fertility should be felt within three months. DRINKING TOO MUCH          Too much alcohol can reduce sperm count and change the shape of sperm cells, making them less effective at fertilising an egg Alcohol is a toxin that kills the cells that generate sperm. Too much alcohol can reduce sperm count and change the shape of sperm cells, making them less effective at fertilising an egg. The effects won't be noticeable unless you drink more than eight units in a day, according to studies. Most alcoholics have a very low sex drive because excessive alcohol over a long period of time raises levels of female hormone oestrogen in the male body. WHAT CAN YOU DO Abstain from alcohol or significantly reduce your intake three months before you try to conceive a child. Heavy drinking can damage DNA in all sperm cells held in the testes so it would take three months of reduced drinking to create sperm from scratch. Impotence caused by alcoholism can take longer to reverse or may not be fully reversible. SMOKING TOBACCO          If you want to have a child, give up smoking at least three months before trying to conceive with your partner, experts say 'In terms of how many sperm you produce in the testes, smoking does not seem to have an effect,' says Dr Pacey. 'However, smoking does damage DNA within the sperm cells, which could lead to infertility and miscarriage, which is the female body's way of getting rid of a developing embryo with major genetic abnormalities. A UK study, published in the medical journal Human Reproduction, recruited 2,249 men from 14 fertility clinics around the UK2 and asked them to fill out detailed questionnaires about their lifestyle. Dr Andrew Povey, from the University of Manchester's School of Community Based Medicine, said: 'Despite lifestyle choices being important for other aspects of our health, our results suggest that many lifestyle choices probably have little influence on how many swimming sperm they ejaculate. For example, whether the man was a current smoker or not was of little importance. The proportion of men who had low numbers of swimming sperm was similar whether they had never been a smoker or a smoker who was currently smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day.' WHAT CAN YOU DO Current NICE guidelines remain that men who want to conceive should give up smoking. However, if you want to have a child, give up smoking at least three months before trying to conceive with your partner. Avoid all recreational drugs. BEING OBESE          Men with a higher body mass index had a significantly higher risk of being infertile compared with men considered to be normal weight, previous research found Studies have found links between obesity and fertility problems in both men and women. In one study, men with a higher body mass index (BMI) had a significantly higher risk of being infertile compared with men considered to be normal weight. In fact, the study found that men who are of normal weight and then put on just 20lbs could increase their chance of male infertility by 10 per cent. 'Several mechanisms may account for the effect of obesity on make infertility, including changes in hormone levels caused by increased weight and increased scotal temperatures due to the fact that larger men tend to have hotter groins with fat acting as insulation,' says Mr Bowen. Men who develop 'man boobs' may be more at risk because the condition suggests heightened levels of the female hormone oestrogen. There is no hard evidence that men who have beer bellies are more at risk than those who are bigger all over. A separate study found that men who had a higher BMI were more likely to have poor quality 'fragmented' sperm where the DNA parcel has broken into pieces. Fragmented sperm DNA is linked to reduced fertility as well as an increased risk of miscarriage. Babies born are more likely to suffer from inherited conditions such as Down's Syndrome. WHAT CAN YOU DO Healthy gradual weight loss should take months and possibly even years to achieve, depending on how much you need to drop to reach a healthy BMI. 'However, neither reversibility of obesity-associated fertility with weight loss not effective therapeutic interventions have been studied in depth,' says Mr Bowen. USING YOUR LAPTOP ON YOUR LAP          Dr Suzanne Kavic, a reproductive endocrinologist based in Pittsburgh, advises men not to place their laptops on their laps as heating of the testicles could result in lower sperm counts 'This is all to do with heat generated by the lap top sitting right over the genital region,' explains Dr Suzanne Kavic, a reproductive endocrinologist based in Pittsburgh in the US. 'However, the heat generated from laptops can impact sperm production and development. 'The heat generated from laptops can impact sperm production and development making it difficult to conceive down the road.' Dr Kavic advises men not to place their laptops on their laps at all since any significant heating of the testicles could result in lower sperm counts and poorer sperm quality. WHAT CAN YOU DO Prop your lap top on the table. In most cases, the effects should be reversed within three months or a full cycle of sperm generation. HAVING A POOR DIET          Researchers at the Harvard Medical School have found that diets high in saturated fat may negatively affect the quality, as well as the quantity of sperm There is some evidence that men who eat a diet rich in antioxidants, which mop up damaging free radicals, are more fertile than men who don't. Colourful vegetables include carrots, purple cabbage, leafy greens are rich in antioxidants like Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Fruit including oranges, lemons and bluecurrants are also a rich sources of Vitamin C. Researchers at the Harvard Medical School have found that diets high in saturated fat may negatively affect the quality, as well as the quantity of sperm. They also found that increasing dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, a polyunsaturated fat, could improve male reproductive health. WHAT CAN YOU DO Eat plenty of oily fish and cut down on red meat. A new study has also pinpointed walnuts as an excellent source of good fatty acids. Eating around two handfuls of walnuts a day improves sperm health in young men, a study in the journal Biology of Reproduction suggests. Sperm shape, movement and vitality improved in men who added walnuts to their diet over 12 weeks. BODYBUILDING          Steroids cause an increase in muscle mass but also trick the body into thinking that the testes, which produce natural testosterone, are producing too much The trend for bulking up with the help of anabolic steroids is having a worrying effect on men's fertility up and down the country. 'In the North East, we are certainly noticing an increase in the number of men who do use steroids and come to us with fertility problems,' says Dr Jane Stewart. High protein shakes should not cause the problems but there is increasing concern that they may contain ingredients which are not on the ingredients lists. Steroids, which mimic the male hormone testosterone, cause an increase in muscle mass but they also trick the body into thinking that the testes, which produce natural testosterone, are producing too much. 'Production of sperm can shut down completely,' says Dr Stewart. 'Men may notice that their testes are shrinking.' WHAT CAN YOU DO 'Sadly, infertility caused by use of steroid drugs is not always reversible,' explains Dr Stewart. However, most men who stop taking steroids will see a gradual return to normal over several months or years. Build muscle naturally with exercise and weight training. YOUR JOB          Studies have shown that men who work regularly with lead – roofers and metal smelters – have lower sperm counts Some jobs are riskier than others when it comes to male infertility. Studies have shown that men who work regularly with lead – roofers and metal smelters – have lower sperm counts and IVF couples who have even small traces of lead in their bloodstream are less likely to conceive than those who don't. 'We know that lead is a testicular toxin and lowers production of motile sperm,' says Dr Pacey. Painters and printers who are exposed to the chemical glycol ether are also more at risk. This chemical is found in glues and printing inks. Occupations which involve working in high temperatures like metal smelting have also been linked to male infertility. WHAT CAN YOU DO It may not be possible to avoid the contaminants altogether but men can take precautions such as wearing face masks when dealing with known chemicals and ensuring that products don't come into direct contact with the skin. 'No one knows for sure but I would predict at least three months, so that new sperm are not affected. The problem with lead is that it tends to stay in the body for a long time, so this effect could take years to remove completely,' says Dr Pacey. GUM DISEASE          Bacteria in gums, which easily passes through the mouth into the bloodstream, may have an inflammatory effect on the testes Visit a dental hygienist regularly if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child, according to research. Bacteria in gums, which easily passes through the mouth into the bloodstream, may have an inflammatory effect on other parts of the body including the testes which produce sperm. Scientists in Israel pinpointed gum disease as one of the causes of male infertility, after seeing an increased rate of gum disease among men having trouble with conceiving a child. The Israeli study looked at the sperm quality of 56 men who came into a fertility clinic. They found that 80 per cent of the men suffered from either gum disease and a low sperm count or zero sperm count was found in 68 per cent of the men. WHAT CAN YOU DO Visit a dental hygienist regularly if you want to maximise your chances of conceiving a child, according to research. The infertility dip can be reversed in a few days after gum disease is eradicated because this is how long it takes any inflammation to subside. GOING VEGETARIAN        A primary source of protein for vegetarians is soya, but research has found over-consuming soya products inhibits sperm production Soya protein, which is a primary source of protein for vegetarians, is a rich source of phyto-oestrogens, or plant oestrogens. Men who drink a lot of soya milk or eat a lot of soya products may inadvertently be raising their levels of female hormones which inhibits sperm production, according to a study carried out by researchers at Queen's University, Belfast. The director of reproductive medicine at Queen's University, Belfast, Dr Sheena Lewis, said: 'What we have shown is that if men are consuming large amounts of soya products, for example, there is a negative relationship between that and the quality of their sperm.' WHAT YOU CAN DO Read the labels on food products. 'If they already have a slight problem in that area, then it might be better for them not to consume so much,' says Dr Lewis who points out that 'hidden' soya protein is often found in fast food and ready meals where it is used to supplement more expensive meat protein. 'You would have to eat a lot to feel the effect,' says Dr Jane Stewart. MOBILE PHONES          'You should probably keep your mobile phone in your jacket pocket rather than in your jeans,' says Dr Stewart Some scientists believe that electromagnetic field exposure from mobile phones may have a negative effect on sperm production. A study published in 2009 found that sperm in a test tube become less active when they are exposed to an electromagnetic field and the DNA within sperm is more likely to break down. Dr Pacey says that the jury is still out and there is no hard evidence that mobile phone emissions have any effect on male fertility. WHAT YOU CAN DO 'It is speculative for now but if you want to play it safe, you should probably keep your mobile phone in your jacket pocket rather than in your jeans,' says Dr Stewart.
