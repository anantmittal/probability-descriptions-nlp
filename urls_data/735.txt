Can I get struck by lightning during a storm in Minecraft?  If so, will it kill me?    minecraft     share | improve this question     asked Apr 14 '12 at 20:36       Zero Stack   18k 53 139 225              3      Since you're building it may be worth looking at How to lightning-proof a structure? – Taz  Apr 15 '12 at 1:17         add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  18  down vote  accepted      Yes, you can be struck by lightning: Being struck by lightning or standing near a lightning strike deals two and a half hearts of damage, not including damage from the fire. Source  Since it doesn't deal too much damage you should survive it as long as you aren't damaged too much. Btw. beware of supercharged creepers, they deal a lot of damage.  Also you don't have to worry about your constructs going up in flames because of a lightning since rain puts fire out.     share | improve this answer      edited Jan 30 '13 at 4:01       BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft   32.2k 39 151 283        answered Apr 14 '12 at 20:46       cedi   1,736 8 11              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      There is a very small possibility that you can be struck by lightning. Other mobs can also be struck, and it has varying effect, for example:   If a pig gets hit by lightning it will turn into a Zombie Pigman.  If lightning strikes a creeper it will become supercharged and be even more deadly.      share | improve this answer      edited Jan 17 '13 at 7:52       Robotnik ♦   24.7k 36 119 208        answered May 13 '12 at 20:41       MrMC   447 4 9 22              add a comment |             up vote  -10  down vote      No, it wont kill you, as Zero stack said. It only deals 2 hearts of damage, and the rain will put it out.  But now in the upgrade of 2013, the damage of lightning is now 3 hearts, and may destroy some items in your inventory.  I've also learned from experience that when you have an item such as   Anvil  Iron bars  End portal  Nether portal  Mine tracks  Mine carts  Iron  Iron armor    You'll get struck more often, and not only that, if you are wearing a complete set of Iron Armor you'll instead take 5 hearts, not 3.  One last thing, if you are wearing Diamond Armor (Full) and get struck by lighting, your armour will have a new enchantment which is called Armour of Gods .  In a nut shell...   It is no longer Diamond Armor , it's godlike armor.  As it will have 2 more bars of full armor, (And each stat, and enchantment will multiply by 10x) and will be 10x more effective, typically for each stat, for example, Blast protection 10x , Feather falling 10x , Protection 10x , Fire protection 10x , etc.  Well I hope this helps     share | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 22:15       Nolonar   25.2k 20 93 152        answered Jan 17 '13 at 5:51       user41041   13 1              14      Do you have a source for all this?

Every tick there is a 1 in 100 thousand chance that lightning will strike in a particular chunk. If this check passes, it picks a random x, z, and selects the highest block on that coordinate. If that block can see the sky, and rain is falling on it, lightning strikes. There is no way to increase the chance of lightning strike.

Lightning also isn't as strong as people think, it usually only takes away two and a half hearts and lights you on fire. To prevent it from hitting the environment would take even more effort judging by the fact that it is about 60 mil blocks wide (1 minecraft world is about 60 mil blocks wide(-30mil - +30mil) Lightning creates fire where it strikes. The accompanying rain can usually put out fires before they spread. Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread. The only time thunder will strike without rain is in a desert since it can't rain in the desert.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 25 '13 at 17:24       Baked Potato   1,300 4 17 33              add a comment |              up vote  4  down vote      Yes, and no. If you are underneath a block, then the lightning will hit the block instead of you. If there is open sky above you, then you cannot prevent lightning from hitting you. This (and spiders) are the reason a ceiling is essential in a house.  Keep in mind that lightning will create fire where it strikes. You can lessen the damage the fire gives you with the Fire Protection enchantment on armor, or you can negate it completely with a Potion of Fire Resistance .  This fire will burn down any wooden buildings you have (If it strikes the building/nearby the building). To counter this, you can build a house made of material other than wood or build an underground house. Some players build a second layer on their roof made of stone, so that lightning strikes from above will not be effective. However, lightning strikes that come from the side of the building will still burn down the house.  When lightning strikes a block, it may destroy that block (depending on the block resistance). To prevent this, you can build a second layer on your roff (the same method mentioned above). This will give your house extra protection against lightning strikes.  Lightning strikes are actually pretty rare, so all this would be extra protection, if you ask me.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 25 '13 at 17:29       avestar101   2,280 20 40 74              1      This fire will burn down any wooden buildings you have - Actually, since lightning can only strike when it rains, and the rain will then put out the fire. Although it may be possible in rare and select cases, in all my years of playing, I have never had any building suffer burn damages by lightning strikes. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 18:54            When lightning strikes a block, it may destroy that block - This is incorrect, lightning will only cause fire. Even the "weakest" of blocks (I can confirm this both with netherack and leaves, both with low blast resistance) will not be destroyed by lightning. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 18:57            Other than those two points, the rest of your information is accurate. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 18:59            @IQAndreas I don't think so.

Getting the creeper struck by lightning is the hard part.  You will likely need lots of luck if you want to avoid finding a mod that will charge one for you. You can see this answer for odds  If you want to use a mod, CommandBook can offer you Thor's hammer to call down lightning strikes with the thor <player> command.  It is also Bukkit compatible.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Jul 13 '13 at 6:14       Batophobia   7,361 21 60 121              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      As David Starkley pointed out , a charged creeper occurs when lightning strikes near a creeper. Although possible, it is extraordinarily improbable that it happens naturally in front of your eyes.  However, you can increase those odds significantly using some tricks by YouTuber Docm77, who was able to pull it off without any mods, map editors, or even creative mode:   YouTube: Minecraft - Producing Power Creepers (video showing off the results)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : Episode 76: Crazy Cats and Power Creepers (video where he explains a bit about the mob trap)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : 77th Episode Special (another video where he explains the mob trap.

Also, via McEdit or other mods/clients, you are able to have supercharged spawn eggs and supercharged spawners.

Pigs turn into Zombie Pig Men when struck by lightning. When a charged creeper explodes it make a large explosion than a regular creeper would.  You can't create them in vanilla minecraft. You have to be patient and wait for lightning to strike. I've only ever seen one in minecraft vanilla once, they are very rare.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 13 '13 at 11:07       PoweredMinecart   41 1                  Welcome to Arqade!

Some mods also allow different ways, but I don't know which those are. If you want to spawn one yourself, install Not Enough Items, it gives you every mob spawner possible.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 4 '13 at 20:36       Galen Nare   969 1 7 10              add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  Jan 3 '14 at 14:07   Thank you for your interest in this question.

First, I'm going to assume that you're playing unmodded, vanilla, single-player Minecraft. It doesn't matter if you're playing in creative or survival mode. I'm also going to assume a 90 degree FOV and normal render distance, just to make the numbers easier. If you increase or decrease either, the chances of seeing a charged Creeper will increase or decrease as well.  Then, there are the requirements:   You must be playing on Easy or higher.  Creepers must have spawned (i.e., at least one night cycle must have started where Creepers spawned)  The Creepers must be on the surface (lightning can't strike underground)  At least one rain cycle must have started after Creepers have spawned.   If any of these conditions aren't met, the chance of encountering a charged Creeper is zero.  So assuming the conditions are met, let's look at the probabilities.  One Creeper, one chunk  Creepers, like all mobs, immediately despawn if they leave a 128-block radius area centered around the player. So if there's a Creeper around, it's somewhere in that area.  Now, if you deobfuscate Minecraft 1.2.5 using MCP 6.2, World::tickBlocksAndAmbiance() indicates Lightning has a 1:100,000 chance of hitting one block in any specific chunk. And if lightning does hit a specific chunk, the game randomly selects one block within that chunk to get the lightning entity.  A chunk contains 16 2 (or 256) blocks so given any specific block, there's a 1:25,600,000 chance of a lightning strike. Since Creepers only take up one block and—once spawned—have no block restrictions, there's a 1:25,600,000 chance of a Creeper getting charged.  One Creeper, all loaded chunks  Since lightning is calculated independently per chunk, we need to account for all loaded chunks. At a normal render distance, a radius of 16 chunks are loaded, for a total of 206. Given the probability of a chunk getting hit by lightning is 1:100,000, that means the probability of at least one chunk getting hit by lightning is 1:485. Multiply that by the chance the Creeper is in that chunk (1:206) and the block the Creeper is on is hit (1:256), the probability of the Creeper being hit by lightning is 1:25,626,249.  One Creeper, all chunks, over time  This is only after one lightning strike, and lightning strikes are calculated once per tick. A tick is 1/20 a second, and according to World::updateWeather() , lightning storms can last for 3,600–15,600 ticks or 3–13 minutes.  So, over time, the probability of that Creeper getting struck by lightning is 1:7,118 at 3 minutes and 1:1,643 at 13 minutes.  Encountering the charged Creeper  But you want to know what the chances are of encountering a charged Creeper are, not the chances of whether one will exist. Since encounter can mean a lot of things, I'm going to use the most liberal definition, which is seeing a charged Creeper. At a normal render distance, you can see 128 blocks out, which corresponds nicely to the allowable radius of the Creeper. And at a 90 degree FOV, you should be able to see 1/4 of the possible render area. If a Creeper is on the surface, you have a 1/4 chance of actually looking in the right direction to see said Creeper.  It's way too complex to try and figure out what happens if the Creeper moves and you move or you're not looking in the right direction, so I'm going to ignore that and assume you and the Creeper aren't moving, but you're actively looking for it by rotating your field of view 360 degrees. Thus, the probability of encountering a charged Creeper should be the same as the Creeper existing.  More Creepers, more fun  Now, if there are more Creepers on the field, you have a better chance of finding a charged Creeper. There are way too many different combinations and scenarios to list out, but here are two idealized scenarios:   There's a Creeper in every block. After one tick, the chances of finding a charged Creeper is 1:485. After 3,600 ticks, there's a ~99.93% chance of encountering a charged Creeper. After 15,600 ticks, the probability is effectively 100%.  There's exactly one Creeper in every chunk. After one tick, the chances of finding a charged Creeper is 1:124,399. After 3,600 ticks, it's 1:35. After 15,600 ticks, it's 1:8.5.      share | improve this answer      edited Oct 12 '13 at 0:45       Anonymous Pi   280 2 4 17        answered Apr 25 '12 at 5:47      user3389                  Just a note: the difference between the figure for 1 creeper, 1 chunk, and 1 creeper, all loaded chunks is just a little bit of calculation error. That's because a creeper is only ever in one chunk, and the chance of that chunk being hit by lightning is 1:100,000 independently of other chunks. So the number of chunks loaded does not effect the probability of a single creeper being hit by lightning. – Theodore Murdock  Jul 13 '13 at 12:32        add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      Edit: See Mark Trapp's answer for the chance of seeing one with the proper conditions met  I would imagine a slim to none chance if you don't improve your chances of seeing one by the means of: going out into an open area outside at night where creepers can spawn while there is a thunderstorm .  As shown in this post, mobs despawn when you unload or leave a certain chunk of land .  That being said, if you don't stay in an area for a long time and the creepers don't despawn.... You would have a slight chance BUT creepers only get charged by being struck by lightning.  (therefore you would need a storm as well)  If you are really interested in seeing a creeper BECOMING CHARGED , try using the Bukkit  mod to spawn mobs.  So,  go into a [creative] world and use the console command:  /spawnmob creeper 1  That should spawn one creeper per the syntax shown here.  For weather type:  /weather storm <time> 
    /lighting <true/false> 
    /thunder <true/false>  Or you can just spawn a charged creeper with this command with the Bukkit mod:  /spawnmob creeper electric  Keep in mind you need Operator privileges to use the Bukkit mod  Also keep in mind charged creepers do a lot more damage then normal creepers.  If you are not in creative mode, keep your distance if you want to survive!     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Apr 25 '12 at 6:07       Zero Stack   18k 53 139 225              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Source  Since it doesn't deal too much damage you should survive it as long as you aren't damaged too much. Btw. beware of supercharged creepers, they deal a lot of damage.  Also you don't have to worry about your constructs going up in flames because of a lightning since rain puts fire out.     share | improve this answer      edited Jan 30 '13 at 4:01       BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft   32.2k 39 151 283        answered Apr 14 '12 at 20:46       cedi   1,736 8 11              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      There is a very small possibility that you can be struck by lightning. Other mobs can also be struck, and it has varying effect, for example:   If a pig gets hit by lightning it will turn into a Zombie Pigman.  If lightning strikes a creeper it will become supercharged and be even more deadly.      share | improve this answer      edited Jan 17 '13 at 7:52       Robotnik ♦   24.7k 36 119 208        answered May 13 '12 at 20:41       MrMC   447 4 9 22              add a comment |             up vote  -10  down vote      No, it wont kill you, as Zero stack said. It only deals 2 hearts of damage, and the rain will put it out.  But now in the upgrade of 2013, the damage of lightning is now 3 hearts, and may destroy some items in your inventory.  I've also learned from experience that when you have an item such as   Anvil  Iron bars  End portal  Nether portal  Mine tracks  Mine carts  Iron  Iron armor    You'll get struck more often, and not only that, if you are wearing a complete set of Iron Armor you'll instead take 5 hearts, not 3.  One last thing, if you are wearing Diamond Armor (Full) and get struck by lighting, your armour will have a new enchantment which is called Armour of Gods .  In a nut shell...   It is no longer Diamond Armor , it's godlike armor.  As it will have 2 more bars of full armor, (And each stat, and enchantment will multiply by 10x) and will be 10x more effective, typically for each stat, for example, Blast protection 10x , Feather falling 10x , Protection 10x , Fire protection 10x , etc.  Well I hope this helps     share | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 22:15       Nolonar   25.2k 20 93 152        answered Jan 17 '13 at 5:51       user41041   13 1              14      Do you have a source for all this? The wiki disagrees, but then it's often slightly behind the updates. – SevenSidedDie  Jan 17 '13 at 8:40         4      I have checked the code, and the odds of getting struck by lightning is entirely random, and has nothing to do with your inventory, or the type of block that the lightning strikes at. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 19:02        2      And as for the Armour of the Gods , you must be playing with some sort of mod, because there is NOTHING of the sort anywhere in the game code, and I have never seen such armor appear in any let's plays. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 19:03            Downvoted for possible data forging. – Anonymous Pi  Oct 4 '13 at 16:34        add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  May 19 '13 at 21:56   Thank you for your interest in this question.

 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

I tried a metal pole and creepers but that didn't work. I have seen them be spawned by a dropper but nothing else. I'm not entirely sure if they exist in vanilla Mine craft or not. It may come in a mod but if it's possible to get it in vanilla please help me.    minecraft     share | improve this question     asked Jul 13 '13 at 5:48       Kitty   36 1 1 2                  Metal actually has no effect on how frequently lightning strikes in MineCraft, and as far as I know, no other material does either. – IQAndreas  Jul 16 '13 at 2:13            um, I'm sure you can spawn them with Command Blocks is 1.7.2, and that's about it. – user63281  Dec 7 '13 at 2:56            No idea if it helps with Minecraft logic, but you could try getting them to the highest point you can to increase their chances of getting struck...my question is why would you WANT to meet such a creeper? – Zibbobz  Jan 3 '14 at 14:23        add a comment |           5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  7  down vote      According to the wiki   A charged Creeper is created when lightning strikes within 3 - 4 blocks of a normal Creeper   You will know it works when the creeper has a blue aura around it.  Getting the creeper struck by lightning is the hard part.  You will likely need lots of luck if you want to avoid finding a mod that will charge one for you. You can see this answer for odds  If you want to use a mod, CommandBook can offer you Thor's hammer to call down lightning strikes with the thor <player> command.  It is also Bukkit compatible.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Jul 13 '13 at 6:14       Batophobia   7,361 21 60 121              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      As David Starkley pointed out , a charged creeper occurs when lightning strikes near a creeper. Although possible, it is extraordinarily improbable that it happens naturally in front of your eyes.  However, you can increase those odds significantly using some tricks by YouTuber Docm77, who was able to pull it off without any mods, map editors, or even creative mode:   YouTube: Minecraft - Producing Power Creepers (video showing off the results)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : Episode 76: Crazy Cats and Power Creepers (video where he explains a bit about the mob trap)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : 77th Episode Special (another video where he explains the mob trap. The explanation begins at around 1hr 5min.)      share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Jul 14 '13 at 0:47       IQAndreas   3,124 1 22 45              1      Could you include a summary of the tricks in these videos for those of us who cannot watch them ourselves? – dlras2  Sep 4 '13 at 20:15        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      To get charged (actually called supercharged) creepers, a lighting bolt has to land within 4 blocks of them. Also, via McEdit or other mods/clients, you are able to have supercharged spawn eggs and supercharged spawners.  Hope this helped!     share | improve this answer      edited Jul 13 '13 at 18:58       Batophobia   7,361 21 60 121        answered Jul 13 '13 at 16:24       user51803   91 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Creepers turn into charged creepers when struck by lightning. Pigs turn into Zombie Pig Men when struck by lightning. When a charged creeper explodes it make a large explosion than a regular creeper would.  You can't create them in vanilla minecraft. You have to be patient and wait for lightning to strike. I've only ever seen one in minecraft vanilla once, they are very rare.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 13 '13 at 11:07       PoweredMinecart   41 1                  Welcome to Arqade!

Please avoid duplicating content and only provide answers that add something new. – Jupotter  Jul 13 '13 at 11:42            @Jupotter Technically it adds some new info.  My answer assumes you know what a Charged Creeper is/does.  As far as OP though, you are right it does not add helpful information to the issue at hand. – Batophobia  Jul 13 '13 at 17:58        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The only possible ways to get a charged creeper is for lightning to strike near it or you use a spawner in NEI to spawn one. Some mods also allow different ways, but I don't know which those are. If you want to spawn one yourself, install Not Enough Items, it gives you every mob spawner possible.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 4 '13 at 20:36       Galen Nare   969 1 7 10              add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  Jan 3 '14 at 14:07   Thank you for your interest in this question.

A lightning bolt strikes a tree. A creeper can be seen hopping about in the woods. If it had been closer to the strike, it would have become charged.  Not to be confused with Lighting .      “   MUOAHAHA! Thunder Storms lower the brightness. That means daytime monsters during storms. This is freakily atmospheric.   „      — Notch on thunderstorms [1]     Thunderstorms are a somewhat common and dangerous weather condition.  Contents   1  Behavior  2  Effects   2.1  Lightning   2.1.1  Thunder  2.1.2  Lightning mechanics      3  History  4  Issues  5  Trivia  6  Gallery  7  References    Behavior [ edit ]  Thunderstorms are a semi-common temporary, global occurrence [2] that can happen randomly at any time, within the Overworld . The exact type of precipitation during a thunderstorm will vary depending on the temperature of the current biome , and the current altitude , too. Thunderstorms may occur randomly, as rain or snow storms worsen. The average storm lasts 0.5 – 1 Minecraft day , and there is a 0.5 to 7.5 day delay between thunderstorms. They can be skipped entirely with the use of a bed .  Effects [ edit ]  As with rain and snow, the sky is darkened and the sun , moon , and stars are no longer visible. Thunderstorms darken the world, causing light from the sky to decrease to a level of 10 in full daylight (however, brightness is closer to a level 11.5 and is tinted blue). The clouds darken from white to a dark gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate or create lightning. While the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible. Unlike during regular rainstorms or snowstorms, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 5 for the purposes of hostile mob spawning, which allows hostile mobs to spawn at any time of the day.  Lightning [ edit ]     Lightning Bolt     Internal ID    JE : none BE : 93     Entity ID    lightning_bolt note: this is not a savegame ID, this is an alias for the purposes of the / summon command.      Lightning is a lethal element to thunderstorms. Lightning momentarily increases the sky light's brightness to slightly greater than full daylight.   The fire that a lightning bolt creates.  Lightning strikes randomly and creates fires where it strikes. Such fires act normally, igniting all flammable materials, detonating TNT , and even activating nether portals . The lightning itself however, is not destructive and will not destroy blocks. While most fires are extinguished by the rain, areas that block rain can allow the fire to spread, and any netherrack lit by lightning will not be extinguished by the rain. Most entities struck by lightning are dealt 5 ( ) damage, and are set on fire, which may cause additional damage. If lightning strikes a pig , it turns into a zombie pigman . If lightning strikes a creeper , it becomes charged . If lightning strikes a villager , it transforms into a witch .   A group of skeletal horsemen spawned during a thunderstorm.  Lightning may randomly spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse , with a chance of 0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.8125–6.75% on Hard, depending on the regional difficulty . If the player is killed by a lightning strike, the death message will read "[player] was struck by lightning." However, this message will not display if the player was killed by the fire created by a lightning bolt. Lightning may be manually summoned with the / summon lightning_bolt command. While it is summoned as an entity, it cannot be referred to by commands or selectors . This may have changed as of 1.12.2.  Thunder [ edit ]  Thunder is a sound event that occurs every time lightning strikes. It can be heard by the player up to 160,000 blocks away from the position of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard instantly, regardless of the player's distance from the lightning strike itself.  Lightning mechanics [ edit ]  For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a 1 ⁄ 100,000 chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm. When lightning is to strike, random X and Z coordinates within the chunk are chosen, and the block just above the highest block that is liquid or blocks movement is chosen for the lightning strike. Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×3× h region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity is standing in. The target block is checked again for the following conditions:  Target block can see sky.  Rain (not snow) is falling in the target block. Thus, lightning does not naturally strike within cold biomes, or biomes where it does not rain (except in the Console Edition ).  If these conditions pass, lightning strikes. When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; damage immunity usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than 5 ( ) damage. Non-solid blocks (such as redstone , torches , and snow layers ) are not directly affected by lightning.  History [ edit ]  Beta  1.5 Added thunderstorms and lightning. Added the ability for lightning to charge creepers and transform pigs into zombie pigmen.  Official release  1.7.2 The rendering brightness is now decreased during thunderstorms. Previously, the sky would darken, but the ground wouldn't appear to get darker, even though monsters could spawn. The clouds and the sky now appear much darker during thunderstorms.  1.8 14w03a Lightning will now transform villagers into witches.  14w30a Lightning can now be manually summoned with the / summon LightningBolt command.  14w32a Lightning now damages Nether mobs and mobs with the Fire Resistance status effect.  1.9 15w38a There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  1.11 16w32a The entity ID is changed from LightningBolt to lightning_bolt .  Upcoming  1.13 18w07a If a player throws a trident enchanted with Channeling at a mob, a lightning bolt will be summoned and will strike that mob. This is the first and only way that a player can manually summon lightning without commands.  Pocket Edition Alpha  0.12.1 build 1 Added thunderstorms.  0.16.0 build 1 There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  Pocket Edition  1.1 build 1 The entity ID is changed from lightningbolt to lightning_bolt .  Legacy Console Edition  TU1 CU1 1.00 Patch 1 Added thunderstorms.   Issues [ edit ]  Issues relating to “Lightning” or “Thunder“ are maintained on the issue tracker . Report issues there.  Trivia [ edit ]  In Bedrock Edition , If the player leaves the world during a thunderstorm and rejoins, it would only be raining.  Lightning, unlike other weather effects, does not have an image file associated with it. Thus, it is coded directly into the game engine, allowing for dynamic, realistic lightning.  In Bedrock Edition , lightning strikes closer to the player more often than in Java Edition and Legacy Console Edition, due to spawn distance limits.  If multiple lightning bolts strike a single villager at the same time, the number of witches spawned as a result is equal to the number of lightning bolts, making it possible, but ridiculously unlikely, to get multiple witches from one villager. This also works with pig-to-pigman transformations, but not creeper-to-charged transformations as the latter is just a change of state rather than a new entity creation.  The player cannot see mobs, water, glass, etc., through lightning.  In Legacy Console Edition , If the player leaves the world with Weather Cycle on during a thunderstorm, it would look like it's only raining, even if it is technically still a thunderstorm.

A lightning bolt strikes a tree. A creeper can be seen hopping about in the woods. If it had been closer to the strike, it would have become charged.  Not to be confused with Lighting .      “   MUOAHAHA! Thunder Storms lower the brightness. That means daytime monsters during storms. This is freakily atmospheric.   „      — Notch on thunderstorms [1]     Thunderstorms are a somewhat common and dangerous weather condition.  Contents   1  Behavior  2  Effects   2.1  Lightning   2.1.1  Thunder  2.1.2  Lightning mechanics      3  History  4  Issues  5  Trivia  6  Gallery  7  References    Behavior [ edit ]  Thunderstorms are a semi-common temporary, global occurrence [2] that can happen randomly at any time, within the Overworld . The exact type of precipitation during a thunderstorm will vary depending on the temperature of the current biome , and the current altitude , too. Thunderstorms may occur randomly, as rain or snow storms worsen. The average storm lasts 0.5 – 1 Minecraft day , and there is a 0.5 to 7.5 day delay between thunderstorms. They can be skipped entirely with the use of a bed .  Effects [ edit ]  As with rain and snow, the sky is darkened and the sun , moon , and stars are no longer visible. Thunderstorms darken the world, causing light from the sky to decrease to a level of 10 in full daylight (however, brightness is closer to a level 11.5 and is tinted blue). The clouds darken from white to a dark gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate or create lightning. While the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible. Unlike during regular rainstorms or snowstorms, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 5 for the purposes of hostile mob spawning, which allows hostile mobs to spawn at any time of the day.  Lightning [ edit ]     Lightning Bolt     Internal ID    JE : none BE : 93     Entity ID    lightning_bolt note: this is not a savegame ID, this is an alias for the purposes of the / summon command.      Lightning is a lethal element to thunderstorms. Lightning momentarily increases the sky light's brightness to slightly greater than full daylight.   The fire that a lightning bolt creates.  Lightning strikes randomly and creates fires where it strikes. Such fires act normally, igniting all flammable materials, detonating TNT , and even activating nether portals . The lightning itself however, is not destructive and will not destroy blocks. While most fires are extinguished by the rain, areas that block rain can allow the fire to spread, and any netherrack lit by lightning will not be extinguished by the rain. Most entities struck by lightning are dealt 5 ( ) damage, and are set on fire, which may cause additional damage. If lightning strikes a pig , it turns into a zombie pigman . If lightning strikes a creeper , it becomes charged . If lightning strikes a villager , it transforms into a witch .   A group of skeletal horsemen spawned during a thunderstorm.  Lightning may randomly spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse , with a chance of 0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.8125–6.75% on Hard, depending on the regional difficulty . If the player is killed by a lightning strike, the death message will read "[player] was struck by lightning." However, this message will not display if the player was killed by the fire created by a lightning bolt. Lightning may be manually summoned with the / summon lightning_bolt command. While it is summoned as an entity, it cannot be referred to by commands or selectors . This may have changed as of 1.12.2.  Thunder [ edit ]  Thunder is a sound event that occurs every time lightning strikes. It can be heard by the player up to 160,000 blocks away from the position of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard instantly, regardless of the player's distance from the lightning strike itself.  Lightning mechanics [ edit ]  For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a 1 ⁄ 100,000 chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm. When lightning is to strike, random X and Z coordinates within the chunk are chosen, and the block just above the highest block that is liquid or blocks movement is chosen for the lightning strike. Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×3× h region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity is standing in. The target block is checked again for the following conditions:  Target block can see sky.  Rain (not snow) is falling in the target block. Thus, lightning does not naturally strike within cold biomes, or biomes where it does not rain (except in the Console Edition ).  If these conditions pass, lightning strikes. When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; damage immunity usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than 5 ( ) damage. Non-solid blocks (such as redstone , torches , and snow layers ) are not directly affected by lightning.  History [ edit ]  Beta  1.5 Added thunderstorms and lightning. Added the ability for lightning to charge creepers and transform pigs into zombie pigmen.  Official release  1.7.2 The rendering brightness is now decreased during thunderstorms. Previously, the sky would darken, but the ground wouldn't appear to get darker, even though monsters could spawn. The clouds and the sky now appear much darker during thunderstorms.  1.8 14w03a Lightning will now transform villagers into witches.  14w30a Lightning can now be manually summoned with the / summon LightningBolt command.  14w32a Lightning now damages Nether mobs and mobs with the Fire Resistance status effect.  1.9 15w38a There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  1.11 16w32a The entity ID is changed from LightningBolt to lightning_bolt .  Upcoming  1.13 18w07a If a player throws a trident enchanted with Channeling at a mob, a lightning bolt will be summoned and will strike that mob. This is the first and only way that a player can manually summon lightning without commands.  Pocket Edition Alpha  0.12.1 build 1 Added thunderstorms.  0.16.0 build 1 There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  Pocket Edition  1.1 build 1 The entity ID is changed from lightningbolt to lightning_bolt .  Legacy Console Edition  TU1 CU1 1.00 Patch 1 Added thunderstorms.   Issues [ edit ]  Issues relating to “Lightning” or “Thunder“ are maintained on the issue tracker . Report issues there.  Trivia [ edit ]  In Bedrock Edition , If the player leaves the world during a thunderstorm and rejoins, it would only be raining.  Lightning, unlike other weather effects, does not have an image file associated with it. Thus, it is coded directly into the game engine, allowing for dynamic, realistic lightning.  In Bedrock Edition , lightning strikes closer to the player more often than in Java Edition and Legacy Console Edition, due to spawn distance limits.  If multiple lightning bolts strike a single villager at the same time, the number of witches spawned as a result is equal to the number of lightning bolts, making it possible, but ridiculously unlikely, to get multiple witches from one villager. This also works with pig-to-pigman transformations, but not creeper-to-charged transformations as the latter is just a change of state rather than a new entity creation.  The player cannot see mobs, water, glass, etc., through lightning.  In Legacy Console Edition , If the player leaves the world with Weather Cycle on during a thunderstorm, it would look like it's only raining, even if it is technically still a thunderstorm.

Will it power redstone dust?
Will lightning be attracted to iron blocks? (the cubes made with 9 pieces of iron ingots)
Are there any other effects from lightning strikes hitting other creatures IE: Will lightning hitting a zombie pigmen cause a special item to drop? Vanstrat 03:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC) I Don't Think it does any of those things but I sure hope Notch adds something like lightning rods that attract lightning. User:Skeptical Melon  –The preceding undated comment was added on 15:45, 23 April 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning hitting a creeper makes it become charged and more powerful, pigs that get hit by lightning get morphed into standard zombie pigmen, deals 2.5 damage if hit by lightning. -- R ocĸetor talk 21:21, 5 May 2011 (UTC)  Correct. Lightning has no affect on any other animals but creepers and pigs, aside from hurting them and lighting them on fire of course. – ultradude25  ( T | C ) at 05:15, 6 May 2011 (UTC)  If it causes sand and gravel to fall, surely it will cause other events triggered by block updates; maybe this should be mentioned but I'm not entirely certain so I shan't add it. 86.146.120.232 16:02, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  The sand falls because the fire gives a block update; and it only happens by floating sand. Pokechu22 23:15, 18 April 2013 (UTC)  Just to update the topic, in recent versions lightning can also turn a villager into a witch. -- MentalMouse42 ( talk ) 17:29, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  1.3.1 Changes [ edit ]  Is it just me, or are thunderstorms more common in 1.3.1? So far it has rained 3 times and 2 of them have been thunderstorms. CycloneChilli 19:08, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Fire [ edit ]  So you take damage from the fire, but it doesn't create real fire?
Does it set you on fire?
Have you seen it strike netherrack, as it's likely the rain puts out the fire? Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires. If lightning hits netherrack it will stay flaming. It just looks bad if there's a question with no answer :D -- R ocĸetor talk 09:31, 17 May 2011 (UTC)  Chances [ edit ]  How often do thunderstorms occur? Roughly how many times would it have to rain before there was a thunderstorm? PLEASE HELP! CycloneChilli 19:30, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  Likelihood [ edit ]  Is there a distinguishing factor that makes lightning strike in a certain place, if so it should be added to this wiki page. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Robeluke  ( Talk | Contribs ) 17:36, 22 April 2011.

It seems like a very minor difference, and feels highly judgmental. Darkid 01:03, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Long story short, there isn't. If something happens when lightning strikes, move it to effects. Tinaun 01:54, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Pigmen [ edit ]  I'm not sure but it doesn't appear that a pigman will take damage from the lightning strike itself.

What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?

Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt

It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire. It deals 3½ hearts of damage to the player. - Asterick6 22:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Charged Creeper??? [ edit ]  Open the page "Thunderstorm".

HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message.

[ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

[ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'.

If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC).

You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects .

-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't.

Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.

Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.

Will it power redstone dust?
Will lightning be attracted to iron blocks? (the cubes made with 9 pieces of iron ingots)
Are there any other effects from lightning strikes hitting other creatures IE: Will lightning hitting a zombie pigmen cause a special item to drop? Vanstrat 03:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC) I Don't Think it does any of those things but I sure hope Notch adds something like lightning rods that attract lightning. User:Skeptical Melon  –The preceding undated comment was added on 15:45, 23 April 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning hitting a creeper makes it become charged and more powerful, pigs that get hit by lightning get morphed into standard zombie pigmen, deals 2.5 damage if hit by lightning. -- R ocĸetor talk 21:21, 5 May 2011 (UTC)  Correct. Lightning has no affect on any other animals but creepers and pigs, aside from hurting them and lighting them on fire of course. – ultradude25  ( T | C ) at 05:15, 6 May 2011 (UTC)  If it causes sand and gravel to fall, surely it will cause other events triggered by block updates; maybe this should be mentioned but I'm not entirely certain so I shan't add it. 86.146.120.232 16:02, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  The sand falls because the fire gives a block update; and it only happens by floating sand. Pokechu22 23:15, 18 April 2013 (UTC)  Just to update the topic, in recent versions lightning can also turn a villager into a witch. -- MentalMouse42 ( talk ) 17:29, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  1.3.1 Changes [ edit ]  Is it just me, or are thunderstorms more common in 1.3.1? So far it has rained 3 times and 2 of them have been thunderstorms. CycloneChilli 19:08, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Fire [ edit ]  So you take damage from the fire, but it doesn't create real fire?
Does it set you on fire?
Have you seen it strike netherrack, as it's likely the rain puts out the fire? Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires. If lightning hits netherrack it will stay flaming. It just looks bad if there's a question with no answer :D -- R ocĸetor talk 09:31, 17 May 2011 (UTC)  Chances [ edit ]  How often do thunderstorms occur? Roughly how many times would it have to rain before there was a thunderstorm? PLEASE HELP! CycloneChilli 19:30, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  Likelihood [ edit ]  Is there a distinguishing factor that makes lightning strike in a certain place, if so it should be added to this wiki page. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Robeluke  ( Talk | Contribs ) 17:36, 22 April 2011.

It seems like a very minor difference, and feels highly judgmental. Darkid 01:03, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Long story short, there isn't. If something happens when lightning strikes, move it to effects. Tinaun 01:54, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Pigmen [ edit ]  I'm not sure but it doesn't appear that a pigman will take damage from the lightning strike itself.

CycloneChilli 19:11, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Is there any reason lightning shouldn't occur in a snow biome?  I can assure you that lightning does not require rain. -- 119.242.124.233 12:02, 23 February 2012 (UTC)  It does happen in this video -- assuming it is indeed natural. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrQLl9pufxU  Whatsifsowhatsit ( talk ) 19:37, 25 November 2013 (UTC)Whatsifsowhatsit  "Trivia: Lightning can go directly through blocks to hit the ground." [ edit ]  What does this phrase mean? How does Minecraft determine which blocks are the "ground" and which block are not the "ground"? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Jecowa  ( Talk | Contribs ) 04:59, 18 July 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   I haven't studied lightning storms or anything, but lightning can be targeted through the use of mods, and it can strike the bedrock through solid ground. I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?  Yilante 10 /28 /2012 6:31 pm 108.228.150.192 01:32, 29 October 2012 (UTC)  Name [ edit ]  If lightning bolt is an entity, what is its technical name? IllidanS4 16:54, 22 September 2011 (UTC)  Also, we need to know the entity ID for lightning. Can we make lightning spawners? :D –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 204.167.95.3  ( Talk ) 15:54, 18 November 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~  O: Lightning spawners?! Actually sounds kinda interesting. I hope Notch adds an ID to Lightning so we can investigate that theory. Wait no, Jeb is in charge of Minecraft for the time being... Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt
The only problem is that the SAVEGAME-Id's of the most technical entities are nowhere to find in the internet.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   well, i got hit and lit on fire –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 99.231.4.68  ( Talk ) 04:32, 27 November 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~  Yes it is possible, although very rare. I was struck by lightning from a thunderstorm while playing on a Beta 1.7.3 SMP server. It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire. It deals 3½ hearts of damage to the player. - Asterick6 22:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Charged Creeper??? [ edit ]  Open the page "Thunderstorm". If you look at the animation, you will see a creeper in the forest.

Has this happened to anyone else? Donatello 23:45, 5 January 2012 (UTC)  Never mind, the Nether page mentions this. Donatello 23:48, 5 January 2012 (UTC)  blizzards [ edit ]  o.k i think we should call lightning in snow biomes blizzards anyone with me? Uthink 22:20, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  Blizzards are extreme snow. Lightning does not classify snow as a blizzard! CycloneChilli 19:25, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  Can Lightning hit any kind of block?

I'd guess it's the same-amount as other "transparent" blocks?  Yilante 10 /28 /12 6:28 pm 108.228.150.192 01:29, 29 October 2012 (UTC)  Charged creepers struck twice [ edit ]  The page says that creepers die after being hit a second time by lightning by "overload". My creeper died after being hit by lightning four times . Does it just die from damage, then? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 75.132.35.214  ( Talk ) 14:23, 8 June 2012.

But the portal definitely is activated when lightning strikes the frame. Is the article wrong then? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 75.132.35.214  ( Talk ) 22:15, 8 June 2012. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Technically, Nether portals are activated by fire inside the portal frame. More fire does not deactivate them, so yes, the article was incorrect. Fixed. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Death Message [ edit ]  What is the death message if you die from lightning? Make sure it's the lightning that kills you and not the fire afterwards. HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message. Haven't actually tested in-game yet. -- Orthotope 20:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Light levels? When did it become 7? [ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

[ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that. I'm still gonna ask them about this. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 87.178.81.201 ( talk ) at 11:56, 18 December 2015 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'. So you were right in your reading of the code! – Sealbudsman  talk / contr 03:06, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  Aaaaah If one could read correctly :P Thank you for clearing up, Superspace ! –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Entereloaded ( talk • contribs ) at 03:21, 26 July 2016 (UTC).

Will it power redstone dust?
Will lightning be attracted to iron blocks? (the cubes made with 9 pieces of iron ingots)
Are there any other effects from lightning strikes hitting other creatures IE: Will lightning hitting a zombie pigmen cause a special item to drop? Vanstrat 03:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC) I Don't Think it does any of those things but I sure hope Notch adds something like lightning rods that attract lightning. User:Skeptical Melon  –The preceding undated comment was added on 15:45, 23 April 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning hitting a creeper makes it become charged and more powerful, pigs that get hit by lightning get morphed into standard zombie pigmen, deals 2.5 damage if hit by lightning. -- R ocĸetor talk 21:21, 5 May 2011 (UTC)  Correct. Lightning has no affect on any other animals but creepers and pigs, aside from hurting them and lighting them on fire of course. – ultradude25  ( T | C ) at 05:15, 6 May 2011 (UTC)  If it causes sand and gravel to fall, surely it will cause other events triggered by block updates; maybe this should be mentioned but I'm not entirely certain so I shan't add it. 86.146.120.232 16:02, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  The sand falls because the fire gives a block update; and it only happens by floating sand. Pokechu22 23:15, 18 April 2013 (UTC)  Just to update the topic, in recent versions lightning can also turn a villager into a witch. -- MentalMouse42 ( talk ) 17:29, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  1.3.1 Changes [ edit ]  Is it just me, or are thunderstorms more common in 1.3.1? So far it has rained 3 times and 2 of them have been thunderstorms. CycloneChilli 19:08, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Fire [ edit ]  So you take damage from the fire, but it doesn't create real fire?
Does it set you on fire?
Have you seen it strike netherrack, as it's likely the rain puts out the fire? Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires. If lightning hits netherrack it will stay flaming. It just looks bad if there's a question with no answer :D -- R ocĸetor talk 09:31, 17 May 2011 (UTC)  Chances [ edit ]  How often do thunderstorms occur? Roughly how many times would it have to rain before there was a thunderstorm? PLEASE HELP!

It seems like a very minor difference, and feels highly judgmental. Darkid 01:03, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Long story short, there isn't. If something happens when lightning strikes, move it to effects. Tinaun 01:54, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Pigmen [ edit ]  I'm not sure but it doesn't appear that a pigman will take damage from the lightning strike itself.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   I haven't studied lightning storms or anything, but lightning can be targeted through the use of mods, and it can strike the bedrock through solid ground. I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?

Actually sounds kinda interesting. I hope Notch adds an ID to Lightning so we can investigate that theory. Wait no, Jeb is in charge of Minecraft for the time being... Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt

It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire.

HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message.

[ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

[ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'. So you were right in your reading of the code! – Sealbudsman  talk / contr 03:06, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  Aaaaah If one could read correctly :P Thank you for clearing up, Superspace ! –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Entereloaded ( talk • contribs ) at 03:21, 26 July 2016 (UTC).

Are there any other effects from lightning strikes hitting other creatures IE: Will lightning hitting a zombie pigmen cause a special item to drop? Vanstrat 03:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC) I Don't Think it does any of those things but I sure hope Notch adds something like lightning rods that attract lightning.

Lightning has no affect on any other animals but creepers and pigs, aside from hurting them and lighting them on fire of course. – ultradude25  ( T | C ) at 05:15, 6 May 2011 (UTC)  If it causes sand and gravel to fall, surely it will cause other events triggered by block updates; maybe this should be mentioned but I'm not entirely certain so I shan't add it. 86.146.120.232 16:02, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  The sand falls because the fire gives a block update; and it only happens by floating sand.

Does it set you on fire?
Have you seen it strike netherrack, as it's likely the rain puts out the fire? Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires. If lightning hits netherrack it will stay flaming. It just looks bad if there's a question with no answer :D -- R ocĸetor talk 09:31, 17 May 2011 (UTC)  Chances [ edit ]  How often do thunderstorms occur?

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   I haven't studied lightning storms or anything, but lightning can be targeted through the use of mods, and it can strike the bedrock through solid ground. I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?

Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt

[ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section?

-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

If it does, please clarify. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 75.165.49.48 ( talk ) at 0:50, 19 January 2015 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning can strike in any loaded chunk, as would be expected (why load a chunk to randomly start fires). – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 00:57, 19 January 2015 (UTC)  Frequency? [ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that. I'm still gonna ask them about this. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 87.178.81.201 ( talk ) at 11:56, 18 December 2015 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'. So you were right in your reading of the code! – Sealbudsman  talk / contr 03:06, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  Aaaaah If one could read correctly :P Thank you for clearing up, Superspace ! –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Entereloaded ( talk • contribs ) at 03:21, 26 July 2016 (UTC).

I was wondering something.   There is a way to make it so creepers can become "charged", and once they are charged I THINK they drop more gunpowder, exciperence, and they increase the chances for mob heads to spawn in game once they are killed. Which is neat becuase it will let me have a production of mob heads to (and maybe player heads!)   I saw on a youtube video some guy making a charged creeper farm, and basically how he set it up is, he has boats on a top roof to further increase the chances of lightning spawning there. I wanted to know if it was true though.   Here is the video link, its a little outdated but I think its still a thing in Minecraft            Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack     Hey you!

I've certainly never heard of them having a different loot table from normal creepers and the wiki doesn't say anything about that.  As for XP, again I think it's the same as a normal creeper since they are a variant of normal creepers.  They certainly aren't listed on the XP page on the wiki , which could be an oversight I suppose.

If they intersect (i.e. its raining and it's thundering) you have a thunder storm.  When this happens there is a chance that a lightning bolt will spawn per tick (something like 1 in 100000 if I remember the code correctly).  On a single player server the strike will occur nearby the player.  On multiplayer it will strike around one of the players.

About the only control you have that will optimize your chances where lightning will strike is to reduce your render distance so the lightning has a smaller space to strike in.

Here is a much better farm you can use (can be scaled). Keep in mind that all charged creeper farms are pretty damn slow, especially when thunderstorms are rare in the first place.

This will not work because the chance of lighting striking is per chunk - fewer chunks loaded will actually decrease the number of lighting strikes in a given time interval - but the number per unit area (chunk) remains the same:  For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a 1/100000 chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm.   http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Thunderstorm#Lightning_mechanics  So, for example, with a render distance of 10 you'll have 441 chunks loaded so the chance of a lightning strike is 441/100000 or once every 11.33 seconds (I believe that lightning does not strike in the outermost chunks so this is probably more. In 1.6.4 the active chunk radius is always 7 for 225 active chunks and one strike every 22.2 seconds regardless of view or render distance).  The most important factor is to make sure they are spread out - lightning does not have to directly strike them:  Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×3×h region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity is standing in...  ...When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning.  Basically, spacing them every 6 blocks would ensure that at one will get struck by lightning; with a smaller spacing you can get more at once (since lightning favors hitting entities it will likely strike one and only affect any others within 3 blocks to the north and west or 2 blocks to the south and east of the target block). Also, since lightning can affect entities 3 blocks below a ceiling it is possible to have an indoor farm (this is also why villagers can be turned into witches despite appearing to be safe).

Charged creepers only occur when struck by lighting. If you put them in your spawn chunks, you can expect to get one after maybe a week of real life gameplay. It's quite uncommon.   Once you get one, use it to blow up a creeper, skeleton or zombie. You'll get a creeper, skeleton or zombie head, respectively. These have no real use in game, but they're pretty.

I recently had my first charged creeper in survival, and obtained a zombie skull via it. Now I'm eager to get the others. But the only obvious way to me seemed to be to obtain a load of name tags (I have a few librarian villagers who trade them), and create some 2 deep pits in a nice flattish area of a single chunk with a tallish observation platform in the middle, and whenever the specifc mob whose skull you want spawns in a pit, name him so he wont despawn and repeat this til you have a good few scattered around, and then hope next time there's a storm, get on your observation platform, and with the increased saturation of your chosen mob, you might get lucky. But it does seem impractical and a waste in the long run of name tags.   I have an observation platform in a partially cleared swamp biome, and I use it for locating and hunting slimes. It was on their during a thunderstorm that heard a lightning strike near me, looked over and there was the charged creeper! But I've also got a lot of wild pigs roaming around which I haven't penned in, and I've had two zombie pigmen created from lightning strikes since, so thae name tag idea would increase your chances (you can approach a mob with an invisibility potion and no armour and it wont see you to tag it - that's how I named my charged creeper and lured him later to a temp set up near my base where I detonated him with a zombie)           Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack                 #3   Sep 21, 2015           rodabon    rodabon      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  Enderdragon Slayer  Join Date: 10/27/2010   Posts: 11,275   Member Details           In addition to what Derman said, you can use mob sorting on a mob trap to sort out creepers to put in a designated area and wait for a thunder storm.  With the steady supply of creepers and if you're close enough for them to not despawn you increase your chances to about maximum possible in a legit survival scenario.

Oh i want this to be survival friendly    In case you didn't know if you get a charged creeper and then it explodes around different mobs their heads drop off        Last edited by Maniac1702 : Jan 17, 2015      Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack                   #2   Jan 17, 2015           DuhDerp    DuhDerp      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  A Space Odyssey  Join Date: 1/10/2015   Posts: 2,183   Member Details          1)find an ocean biome (rain, and thus thunderstorms, happen more frequently there)  2)find and light up or fill in all the caves in the area so mobs cannot spawn there  3)cover the surface with land so mobs can spawn there instead (being a large open area with nowhere else to spawn, I imagine there'd be a really large spawn rate like deserts)  4)kill all the lights (hostile mobs won't spawn with a light level of 8 or more)    This probably won't be significantly effective, given that lightning strikes are relatively rare and totally random, but perhaps there's a mod that gets all Dr. Frankenstein or Thomas Edison for controlled electrical funtimes.

Lightning strikes are completely random, and when and where they strike are not affected by anything (Except for the fact that there is or isn't a current thunder storm). A good idea (Requires many nametags) is to trap Creepers in a spread out area, the more you have revealed to the surface, the more likely it is to strike one. But adding more Creepers doesn't directly affect lightning. It just gives it more 'targets' to hit.

You ninja'd me....! And you're wrong about ocean biomes having more chances of rain/lightning. If you can give me an official source saying that, i'd like to see. The rest of your facts, can indeed indirectly increase your chances.

Lightning strikes randomly throughout the world. And there is no percentage of what or where it strikes.

The space between every hole is then 6 blocks, since lightning strikes always on a 3 by 3 blocks space, and some players even surround the edges of every hole with netherrack, to see right away if it is hit. So that is a way to have a little bit more change of getting a lightning creeper. However, luring a creeper in such a hole and nametag it can be quite tricky and dangerous and such a farm does only increase luck for real if it is very large and if every hole has a creeper in it.

I'm in a new world and there hasn't been any rain since i started (about 2 months). I'm NOT  asking if there is a way to make it rain more often. But unfortunately i'm on a VERY hilly place :/ looks like i will just have to wait until i actually get rain and hopefully it's a thunderstorm           Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack                   #8   Jan 17, 2015           RobertFrans    RobertFrans      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  A Space Odyssey  Join Date: 1/19/2013   Posts: 2,418   Location: The Netherlands   Member Details          Do you sleep at night? Because everytime you sleep, the weather gets a reset. So if you sleep every night, it will never rain. And as a sidenote: biomes and landscapes do not influence the weather.

Forcing a creeper to get struck by lighting is very difficult because lightning is random.    On a side note, I was playing some multiplayer with my friends and we saw a charged creeper.    Good luck by the way!

There should be reasons to stay inside.  And seeing how illnesses would be a bit on the complex side for minecraft, this would work perfectly.   seems like the code would be easy enough to make, as well. Just shift the lightning strikes x blocks closer to the player for every y amount of armor...  although, I don't know how the RNG they used for lightning works, so I could be wrong.

Alright. I'll accept this if you take this into account:  Lava is generally 700~1300 degrees celcius. This is 1300~2400 fahrenheit.  If you come within 2 meters of lava, you will be immolated, if you come within 1 meter of lava, you will take lava burn damage. If you stand in lava, you will instantly die... If you are immolated and move away to heal, you are permanently burned, you lose your maximum health until you die (you're arms/legs/otherwise are now scorched cinders)  THAT'S REALISM.

There are a few different types of weather effects, which only occur in the Overworld . Weather may have positive or negative effects on the environment, Mobs or Players .  Contents [ show ]  Rain  Rain is a semi-common weather occurrence and is one of the two possible forms of precipitation. When it is raining, blue Particles streak directly down from the sky until they come into contact with a surface. Small blue particles are left for a few seconds when individual droplets hit the ground (similar to how drops can seep through blocks when seen from below).      During a rainstorm the ambient light level drops.    Monsters cannot spawn in the rain during daylight (light level 12). Rain will extinguish Fire upon the surface of the overworld, and even mobs that may happen to be on fire. Rain cannot be heard near the Bedrock layer of a world. Passive mobs will jump up and down, trying to keep dry. On multiplayer servers, players can toggle between rain and clear skies using the " toggledownfall " command .    Thunderstorms  Thunderstorms (sometimes called Thunder or Lightning ) are a special type of weather. They are considered dangerous because they not only make the environment dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn, but have various effects on certain mobs, nearly all of which are bad for a player. Pigs , if hit by lightning become Zombie Pigmen , Villagers become Witches , and Creepers become a variant known as "Charged Creepers". Lightning can also set blocks on Fire . If lightning strikes within a few blocks/meters of any mob, they lose health. As of The Combat Update , a lighning may spawn a Skeleton Trap Horse . These spawn aditional horsemen when a player comes near them.  Snow  Snow falls occasionally in cold Biomes , such as the Ice Plains Biome , Ice Plains Spikes Biome , and Cold Taiga Biomes . Snow can also occur in the Extreme Hills Biome , at high altitudes. Snow can cover the land with a layer, creating "ice caps" on the mountains of an Extreme Hills biome.  Overcast  Overcast occurs in dry biomes, such as Deserts , Savannas , and Mesa Biomes . While it does not rain in those biomes, the light level will still drop and the Sun and Moon become shrouded, so a player can only tell their position with a clock . Overcast can be a useful sign that weather is occurring elsewhere while a player is in a Desert, Savanna or Mesa.  Trivia  Since thunderstorms are darker than rain , it is possible for mobs to spawn at any time of Daytime or Night . Players can still sleep during a thunderstorm, even during the daytime. It is very rare, but possible for a lightning bolt to activate a Nether Portal . If a "Charged Creeper" is struck by lightning again, it dies. This is because lightning deals damage. Rain can deal damage to Endermen , Blazes and Snow Golems . If Endermen are out in the Overworld during a rain storm, they will rapidly teleport around randomly as they attempt to find a spot where they won't get wet. Weather was introduced to Minecraft in Beta 1.5 . Weather can be changed using " weather " command . To use the weather command a player must type: /weather <clear/rainy/stormy> . The console will then announce: "Turning to (rainy/stormy/clear)". When the Sun is visible, it can be considered "clear weather". Leaving a Cauldron in the rain, may cause it to fill up with water, if a block tick hits the cauldron. This onlyhas a small chance of occurring. A block of Farmland may become hydrated during a rainfall.  Gallery  A "Charged" Creeper A Zombie Pigman Lightning strikes a tree. Lightning in Minecraft . Lightning in Minecraft .

Source  Since it doesn't deal too much damage you should survive it as long as you aren't damaged too much. Btw. beware of supercharged creepers, they deal a lot of damage.  Also you don't have to worry about your constructs going up in flames because of a lightning since rain puts fire out.     share | improve this answer      edited Jan 30 '13 at 4:01       BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft   32.2k 39 151 283        answered Apr 14 '12 at 20:46       cedi   1,736 8 11              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      There is a very small possibility that you can be struck by lightning. Other mobs can also be struck, and it has varying effect, for example:   If a pig gets hit by lightning it will turn into a Zombie Pigman.  If lightning strikes a creeper it will become supercharged and be even more deadly.      share | improve this answer      edited Jan 17 '13 at 7:52       Robotnik ♦   24.7k 36 119 208        answered May 13 '12 at 20:41       MrMC   447 4 9 22              add a comment |             up vote  -10  down vote      No, it wont kill you, as Zero stack said. It only deals 2 hearts of damage, and the rain will put it out.  But now in the upgrade of 2013, the damage of lightning is now 3 hearts, and may destroy some items in your inventory.  I've also learned from experience that when you have an item such as   Anvil  Iron bars  End portal  Nether portal  Mine tracks  Mine carts  Iron  Iron armor    You'll get struck more often, and not only that, if you are wearing a complete set of Iron Armor you'll instead take 5 hearts, not 3.  One last thing, if you are wearing Diamond Armor (Full) and get struck by lighting, your armour will have a new enchantment which is called Armour of Gods .  In a nut shell...   It is no longer Diamond Armor , it's godlike armor.  As it will have 2 more bars of full armor, (And each stat, and enchantment will multiply by 10x) and will be 10x more effective, typically for each stat, for example, Blast protection 10x , Feather falling 10x , Protection 10x , Fire protection 10x , etc.  Well I hope this helps     share | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 22:15       Nolonar   25.2k 20 93 152        answered Jan 17 '13 at 5:51       user41041   13 1              14      Do you have a source for all this?

Every tick there is a 1 in 100 thousand chance that lightning will strike in a particular chunk. If this check passes, it picks a random x, z, and selects the highest block on that coordinate. If that block can see the sky, and rain is falling on it, lightning strikes. There is no way to increase the chance of lightning strike.

Lightning also isn't as strong as people think, it usually only takes away two and a half hearts and lights you on fire. To prevent it from hitting the environment would take even more effort judging by the fact that it is about 60 mil blocks wide (1 minecraft world is about 60 mil blocks wide(-30mil - +30mil) Lightning creates fire where it strikes. The accompanying rain can usually put out fires before they spread. Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread. The only time thunder will strike without rain is in a desert since it can't rain in the desert.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 25 '13 at 17:24       Baked Potato   1,300 4 17 33              add a comment |              up vote  4  down vote      Yes, and no. If you are underneath a block, then the lightning will hit the block instead of you. If there is open sky above you, then you cannot prevent lightning from hitting you. This (and spiders) are the reason a ceiling is essential in a house.  Keep in mind that lightning will create fire where it strikes. You can lessen the damage the fire gives you with the Fire Protection enchantment on armor, or you can negate it completely with a Potion of Fire Resistance .  This fire will burn down any wooden buildings you have (If it strikes the building/nearby the building). To counter this, you can build a house made of material other than wood or build an underground house. Some players build a second layer on their roof made of stone, so that lightning strikes from above will not be effective. However, lightning strikes that come from the side of the building will still burn down the house.  When lightning strikes a block, it may destroy that block (depending on the block resistance). To prevent this, you can build a second layer on your roff (the same method mentioned above). This will give your house extra protection against lightning strikes.  Lightning strikes are actually pretty rare, so all this would be extra protection, if you ask me.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 25 '13 at 17:29       avestar101   2,280 20 40 74              1      This fire will burn down any wooden buildings you have - Actually, since lightning can only strike when it rains, and the rain will then put out the fire. Although it may be possible in rare and select cases, in all my years of playing, I have never had any building suffer burn damages by lightning strikes. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 18:54            When lightning strikes a block, it may destroy that block - This is incorrect, lightning will only cause fire. Even the "weakest" of blocks (I can confirm this both with netherack and leaves, both with low blast resistance) will not be destroyed by lightning. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 18:57            Other than those two points, the rest of your information is accurate. – IQAndreas  Jul 25 '13 at 18:59            @IQAndreas I don't think so. I've never seen rain put out fire, and see lightning striking dirt and destroying it. – avestar101  Jul 25 '13 at 19:37            Hm, I'll have to poke around a bit in the code and get back to you, they may have changed things since I last looked at the code, or I misread it the first time. – IQAndreas  Jul 30 '13 at 10:51         |  show 1 more comment            up vote  3  down vote      Lightning cannot strike underneath blocks, so a ceiling is the only real way to protect yourself.

Getting the creeper struck by lightning is the hard part.  You will likely need lots of luck if you want to avoid finding a mod that will charge one for you. You can see this answer for odds  If you want to use a mod, CommandBook can offer you Thor's hammer to call down lightning strikes with the thor <player> command.  It is also Bukkit compatible.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Jul 13 '13 at 6:14       Batophobia   7,361 21 60 121              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      As David Starkley pointed out , a charged creeper occurs when lightning strikes near a creeper. Although possible, it is extraordinarily improbable that it happens naturally in front of your eyes.  However, you can increase those odds significantly using some tricks by YouTuber Docm77, who was able to pull it off without any mods, map editors, or even creative mode:   YouTube: Minecraft - Producing Power Creepers (video showing off the results)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : Episode 76: Crazy Cats and Power Creepers (video where he explains a bit about the mob trap)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : 77th Episode Special (another video where he explains the mob trap.

Also, via McEdit or other mods/clients, you are able to have supercharged spawn eggs and supercharged spawners.

Pigs turn into Zombie Pig Men when struck by lightning. When a charged creeper explodes it make a large explosion than a regular creeper would.  You can't create them in vanilla minecraft. You have to be patient and wait for lightning to strike. I've only ever seen one in minecraft vanilla once, they are very rare.     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 13 '13 at 11:07       PoweredMinecart   41 1                  Welcome to Arqade!

Some mods also allow different ways, but I don't know which those are. If you want to spawn one yourself, install Not Enough Items, it gives you every mob spawner possible.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 4 '13 at 20:36       Galen Nare   969 1 7 10              add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  Jan 3 '14 at 14:07   Thank you for your interest in this question.

First, I'm going to assume that you're playing unmodded, vanilla, single-player Minecraft. It doesn't matter if you're playing in creative or survival mode. I'm also going to assume a 90 degree FOV and normal render distance, just to make the numbers easier. If you increase or decrease either, the chances of seeing a charged Creeper will increase or decrease as well.  Then, there are the requirements:   You must be playing on Easy or higher.  Creepers must have spawned (i.e., at least one night cycle must have started where Creepers spawned)  The Creepers must be on the surface (lightning can't strike underground)  At least one rain cycle must have started after Creepers have spawned.   If any of these conditions aren't met, the chance of encountering a charged Creeper is zero.  So assuming the conditions are met, let's look at the probabilities.  One Creeper, one chunk  Creepers, like all mobs, immediately despawn if they leave a 128-block radius area centered around the player. So if there's a Creeper around, it's somewhere in that area.  Now, if you deobfuscate Minecraft 1.2.5 using MCP 6.2, World::tickBlocksAndAmbiance() indicates Lightning has a 1:100,000 chance of hitting one block in any specific chunk. And if lightning does hit a specific chunk, the game randomly selects one block within that chunk to get the lightning entity.  A chunk contains 16 2 (or 256) blocks so given any specific block, there's a 1:25,600,000 chance of a lightning strike. Since Creepers only take up one block and—once spawned—have no block restrictions, there's a 1:25,600,000 chance of a Creeper getting charged.  One Creeper, all loaded chunks  Since lightning is calculated independently per chunk, we need to account for all loaded chunks. At a normal render distance, a radius of 16 chunks are loaded, for a total of 206. Given the probability of a chunk getting hit by lightning is 1:100,000, that means the probability of at least one chunk getting hit by lightning is 1:485. Multiply that by the chance the Creeper is in that chunk (1:206) and the block the Creeper is on is hit (1:256), the probability of the Creeper being hit by lightning is 1:25,626,249.  One Creeper, all chunks, over time  This is only after one lightning strike, and lightning strikes are calculated once per tick. A tick is 1/20 a second, and according to World::updateWeather() , lightning storms can last for 3,600–15,600 ticks or 3–13 minutes.  So, over time, the probability of that Creeper getting struck by lightning is 1:7,118 at 3 minutes and 1:1,643 at 13 minutes.  Encountering the charged Creeper  But you want to know what the chances are of encountering a charged Creeper are, not the chances of whether one will exist. Since encounter can mean a lot of things, I'm going to use the most liberal definition, which is seeing a charged Creeper. At a normal render distance, you can see 128 blocks out, which corresponds nicely to the allowable radius of the Creeper. And at a 90 degree FOV, you should be able to see 1/4 of the possible render area. If a Creeper is on the surface, you have a 1/4 chance of actually looking in the right direction to see said Creeper.  It's way too complex to try and figure out what happens if the Creeper moves and you move or you're not looking in the right direction, so I'm going to ignore that and assume you and the Creeper aren't moving, but you're actively looking for it by rotating your field of view 360 degrees. Thus, the probability of encountering a charged Creeper should be the same as the Creeper existing.  More Creepers, more fun  Now, if there are more Creepers on the field, you have a better chance of finding a charged Creeper. There are way too many different combinations and scenarios to list out, but here are two idealized scenarios:   There's a Creeper in every block. After one tick, the chances of finding a charged Creeper is 1:485. After 3,600 ticks, there's a ~99.93% chance of encountering a charged Creeper. After 15,600 ticks, the probability is effectively 100%.  There's exactly one Creeper in every chunk. After one tick, the chances of finding a charged Creeper is 1:124,399. After 3,600 ticks, it's 1:35. After 15,600 ticks, it's 1:8.5.      share | improve this answer      edited Oct 12 '13 at 0:45       Anonymous Pi   280 2 4 17        answered Apr 25 '12 at 5:47      user3389                  Just a note: the difference between the figure for 1 creeper, 1 chunk, and 1 creeper, all loaded chunks is just a little bit of calculation error. That's because a creeper is only ever in one chunk, and the chance of that chunk being hit by lightning is 1:100,000 independently of other chunks. So the number of chunks loaded does not effect the probability of a single creeper being hit by lightning. – Theodore Murdock  Jul 13 '13 at 12:32        add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      Edit: See Mark Trapp's answer for the chance of seeing one with the proper conditions met  I would imagine a slim to none chance if you don't improve your chances of seeing one by the means of: going out into an open area outside at night where creepers can spawn while there is a thunderstorm .  As shown in this post, mobs despawn when you unload or leave a certain chunk of land .  That being said, if you don't stay in an area for a long time and the creepers don't despawn.... You would have a slight chance BUT creepers only get charged by being struck by lightning.  (therefore you would need a storm as well)  If you are really interested in seeing a creeper BECOMING CHARGED , try using the Bukkit  mod to spawn mobs.  So,  go into a [creative] world and use the console command:  /spawnmob creeper 1  That should spawn one creeper per the syntax shown here.  For weather type:  /weather storm <time> 
    /lighting <true/false> 
    /thunder <true/false>  Or you can just spawn a charged creeper with this command with the Bukkit mod:  /spawnmob creeper electric  Keep in mind you need Operator privileges to use the Bukkit mod  Also keep in mind charged creepers do a lot more damage then normal creepers.  If you are not in creative mode, keep your distance if you want to survive!     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Apr 25 '12 at 6:07       Zero Stack   18k 53 139 225              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Source  Since it doesn't deal too much damage you should survive it as long as you aren't damaged too much. Btw. beware of supercharged creepers, they deal a lot of damage.  Also you don't have to worry about your constructs going up in flames because of a lightning since rain puts fire out.     share | improve this answer      edited Jan 30 '13 at 4:01       BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft   32.2k 39 151 283        answered Apr 14 '12 at 20:46       cedi   1,736 8 11              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      There is a very small possibility that you can be struck by lightning. Other mobs can also be struck, and it has varying effect, for example:   If a pig gets hit by lightning it will turn into a Zombie Pigman.  If lightning strikes a creeper it will become supercharged and be even more deadly.      share | improve this answer      edited Jan 17 '13 at 7:52       Robotnik ♦   24.7k 36 119 208        answered May 13 '12 at 20:41       MrMC   447 4 9 22              add a comment |             up vote  -10  down vote      No, it wont kill you, as Zero stack said. It only deals 2 hearts of damage, and the rain will put it out.  But now in the upgrade of 2013, the damage of lightning is now 3 hearts, and may destroy some items in your inventory.  I've also learned from experience that when you have an item such as   Anvil  Iron bars  End portal  Nether portal  Mine tracks  Mine carts  Iron  Iron armor    You'll get struck more often, and not only that, if you are wearing a complete set of Iron Armor you'll instead take 5 hearts, not 3.  One last thing, if you are wearing Diamond Armor (Full) and get struck by lighting, your armour will have a new enchantment which is called Armour of Gods .  In a nut shell...   It is no longer Diamond Armor , it's godlike armor.  As it will have 2 more bars of full armor, (And each stat, and enchantment will multiply by 10x) and will be 10x more effective, typically for each stat, for example, Blast protection 10x , Feather falling 10x , Protection 10x , Fire protection 10x , etc.  Well I hope this helps     share | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 22:15       Nolonar   25.2k 20 93 152        answered Jan 17 '13 at 5:51       user41041   13 1              14      Do you have a source for all this?

 (NOAA) and other partners, Lightning Safety Week is held the last
 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

That talking on the telephone is the leading cause of lightning injuries inside the home? That standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter? And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

Getting the creeper struck by lightning is the hard part.  You will likely need lots of luck if you want to avoid finding a mod that will charge one for you. You can see this answer for odds  If you want to use a mod, CommandBook can offer you Thor's hammer to call down lightning strikes with the thor <player> command.  It is also Bukkit compatible.     share | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:09       Community ♦   1        answered Jul 13 '13 at 6:14       Batophobia   7,361 21 60 121              add a comment |              up vote  2  down vote      As David Starkley pointed out , a charged creeper occurs when lightning strikes near a creeper. Although possible, it is extraordinarily improbable that it happens naturally in front of your eyes.  However, you can increase those odds significantly using some tricks by YouTuber Docm77, who was able to pull it off without any mods, map editors, or even creative mode:   YouTube: Minecraft - Producing Power Creepers (video showing off the results)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : Episode 76: Crazy Cats and Power Creepers (video where he explains a bit about the mob trap)  YouTube: Docm77´s NEW Minecraft World Tour : 77th Episode Special (another video where he explains the mob trap.

Also, via McEdit or other mods/clients, you are able to have supercharged spawn eggs and supercharged spawners.  Hope this helped!     share | improve this answer      edited Jul 13 '13 at 18:58       Batophobia   7,361 21 60 121        answered Jul 13 '13 at 16:24       user51803   91 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Creepers turn into charged creepers when struck by lightning. Pigs turn into Zombie Pig Men when struck by lightning. When a charged creeper explodes it make a large explosion than a regular creeper would.  You can't create them in vanilla minecraft. You have to be patient and wait for lightning to strike.

Please avoid duplicating content and only provide answers that add something new. – Jupotter  Jul 13 '13 at 11:42            @Jupotter Technically it adds some new info.  My answer assumes you know what a Charged Creeper is/does.  As far as OP though, you are right it does not add helpful information to the issue at hand. – Batophobia  Jul 13 '13 at 17:58        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The only possible ways to get a charged creeper is for lightning to strike near it or you use a spawner in NEI to spawn one. Some mods also allow different ways, but I don't know which those are. If you want to spawn one yourself, install Not Enough Items, it gives you every mob spawner possible.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 4 '13 at 20:36       Galen Nare   969 1 7 10              add a comment |         protected by Community ♦  Jan 3 '14 at 14:07   Thank you for your interest in this question.

The exact type of precipitation during a thunderstorm will vary depending on the temperature of the current biome , and the current altitude , too. Thunderstorms may occur randomly, as rain or snow storms worsen. The average storm lasts 0.5 – 1 Minecraft day , and there is a 0.5 to 7.5 day delay between thunderstorms. They can be skipped entirely with the use of a bed .  Effects [ edit ]  As with rain and snow, the sky is darkened and the sun , moon , and stars are no longer visible. Thunderstorms darken the world, causing light from the sky to decrease to a level of 10 in full daylight (however, brightness is closer to a level 11.5 and is tinted blue). The clouds darken from white to a dark gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate or create lightning. While the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible. Unlike during regular rainstorms or snowstorms, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 5 for the purposes of hostile mob spawning, which allows hostile mobs to spawn at any time of the day.  Lightning [ edit ]     Lightning Bolt     Internal ID    JE : none BE : 93     Entity ID    lightning_bolt note: this is not a savegame ID, this is an alias for the purposes of the / summon command.      Lightning is a lethal element to thunderstorms. Lightning momentarily increases the sky light's brightness to slightly greater than full daylight.   The fire that a lightning bolt creates.  Lightning strikes randomly and creates fires where it strikes. Such fires act normally, igniting all flammable materials, detonating TNT , and even activating nether portals . The lightning itself however, is not destructive and will not destroy blocks. While most fires are extinguished by the rain, areas that block rain can allow the fire to spread, and any netherrack lit by lightning will not be extinguished by the rain. Most entities struck by lightning are dealt 5 ( ) damage, and are set on fire, which may cause additional damage. If lightning strikes a pig , it turns into a zombie pigman . If lightning strikes a creeper , it becomes charged . If lightning strikes a villager , it transforms into a witch .   A group of skeletal horsemen spawned during a thunderstorm.  Lightning may randomly spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse , with a chance of 0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.8125–6.75% on Hard, depending on the regional difficulty . If the player is killed by a lightning strike, the death message will read "[player] was struck by lightning." However, this message will not display if the player was killed by the fire created by a lightning bolt. Lightning may be manually summoned with the / summon lightning_bolt command. While it is summoned as an entity, it cannot be referred to by commands or selectors . This may have changed as of 1.12.2.  Thunder [ edit ]  Thunder is a sound event that occurs every time lightning strikes. It can be heard by the player up to 160,000 blocks away from the position of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard instantly, regardless of the player's distance from the lightning strike itself.  Lightning mechanics [ edit ]  For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a 1 ⁄ 100,000 chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm. When lightning is to strike, random X and Z coordinates within the chunk are chosen, and the block just above the highest block that is liquid or blocks movement is chosen for the lightning strike. Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×3× h region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity is standing in. The target block is checked again for the following conditions:  Target block can see sky.  Rain (not snow) is falling in the target block. Thus, lightning does not naturally strike within cold biomes, or biomes where it does not rain (except in the Console Edition ).  If these conditions pass, lightning strikes. When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; damage immunity usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than 5 ( ) damage. Non-solid blocks (such as redstone , torches , and snow layers ) are not directly affected by lightning.  History [ edit ]  Beta  1.5 Added thunderstorms and lightning. Added the ability for lightning to charge creepers and transform pigs into zombie pigmen.  Official release  1.7.2 The rendering brightness is now decreased during thunderstorms. Previously, the sky would darken, but the ground wouldn't appear to get darker, even though monsters could spawn. The clouds and the sky now appear much darker during thunderstorms.  1.8 14w03a Lightning will now transform villagers into witches.  14w30a Lightning can now be manually summoned with the / summon LightningBolt command.  14w32a Lightning now damages Nether mobs and mobs with the Fire Resistance status effect.  1.9 15w38a There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  1.11 16w32a The entity ID is changed from LightningBolt to lightning_bolt .  Upcoming  1.13 18w07a If a player throws a trident enchanted with Channeling at a mob, a lightning bolt will be summoned and will strike that mob. This is the first and only way that a player can manually summon lightning without commands.  Pocket Edition Alpha  0.12.1 build 1 Added thunderstorms.  0.16.0 build 1 There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  Pocket Edition  1.1 build 1 The entity ID is changed from lightningbolt to lightning_bolt .  Legacy Console Edition  TU1 CU1 1.00 Patch 1 Added thunderstorms.   Issues [ edit ]  Issues relating to “Lightning” or “Thunder“ are maintained on the issue tracker . Report issues there.  Trivia [ edit ]  In Bedrock Edition , If the player leaves the world during a thunderstorm and rejoins, it would only be raining.  Lightning, unlike other weather effects, does not have an image file associated with it. Thus, it is coded directly into the game engine, allowing for dynamic, realistic lightning.  In Bedrock Edition , lightning strikes closer to the player more often than in Java Edition and Legacy Console Edition, due to spawn distance limits.  If multiple lightning bolts strike a single villager at the same time, the number of witches spawned as a result is equal to the number of lightning bolts, making it possible, but ridiculously unlikely, to get multiple witches from one villager. This also works with pig-to-pigman transformations, but not creeper-to-charged transformations as the latter is just a change of state rather than a new entity creation.  The player cannot see mobs, water, glass, etc., through lightning.  In Legacy Console Edition , If the player leaves the world with Weather Cycle on during a thunderstorm, it would look like it's only raining, even if it is technically still a thunderstorm.

The target block is checked again for the following conditions:  Target block can see sky.  Rain (not snow) is falling in the target block. Thus, lightning does not naturally strike within cold biomes, or biomes where it does not rain (except in the Console Edition ).  If these conditions pass, lightning strikes. When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; damage immunity usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than 5 ( ) damage. Non-solid blocks (such as redstone , torches , and snow layers ) are not directly affected by lightning.  History [ edit ]  Beta  1.5 Added thunderstorms and lightning. Added the ability for lightning to charge creepers and transform pigs into zombie pigmen.  Official release  1.7.2 The rendering brightness is now decreased during thunderstorms. Previously, the sky would darken, but the ground wouldn't appear to get darker, even though monsters could spawn. The clouds and the sky now appear much darker during thunderstorms.  1.8 14w03a Lightning will now transform villagers into witches.  14w30a Lightning can now be manually summoned with the / summon LightningBolt command.  14w32a Lightning now damages Nether mobs and mobs with the Fire Resistance status effect.  1.9 15w38a There is a chance (depending on regional difficulty ) that a lightning strike will spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse .  1.11 16w32a The entity ID is changed from LightningBolt to lightning_bolt .  Upcoming  1.13 18w07a If a player throws a trident enchanted with Channeling at a mob, a lightning bolt will be summoned and will strike that mob.

Issues [ edit ]  Issues relating to “Lightning” or “Thunder“ are maintained on the issue tracker . Report issues there.  Trivia [ edit ]  In Bedrock Edition , If the player leaves the world during a thunderstorm and rejoins, it would only be raining.  Lightning, unlike other weather effects, does not have an image file associated with it. Thus, it is coded directly into the game engine, allowing for dynamic, realistic lightning.  In Bedrock Edition , lightning strikes closer to the player more often than in Java Edition and Legacy Console Edition, due to spawn distance limits.  If multiple lightning bolts strike a single villager at the same time, the number of witches spawned as a result is equal to the number of lightning bolts, making it possible, but ridiculously unlikely, to get multiple witches from one villager. This also works with pig-to-pigman transformations, but not creeper-to-charged transformations as the latter is just a change of state rather than a new entity creation.  The player cannot see mobs, water, glass, etc., through lightning.  In Legacy Console Edition , If the player leaves the world with Weather Cycle on during a thunderstorm, it would look like it's only raining, even if it is technically still a thunderstorm.

A lightning bolt strikes a tree. A creeper can be seen hopping about in the woods. If it had been closer to the strike, it would have become charged.  Not to be confused with Lighting .      “   MUOAHAHA! Thunder Storms lower the brightness. That means daytime monsters during storms. This is freakily atmospheric.   „      — Notch on thunderstorms [1]     Thunderstorms are a somewhat common and dangerous weather condition.  Contents   1  Behavior  2  Effects   2.1  Lightning   2.1.1  Thunder  2.1.2  Lightning mechanics      3  History  4  Issues  5  Trivia  6  Gallery  7  References    Behavior [ edit ]  Thunderstorms are a semi-common temporary, global occurrence [2] that can happen randomly at any time, within the Overworld . The exact type of precipitation during a thunderstorm will vary depending on the temperature of the current biome , and the current altitude , too. Thunderstorms may occur randomly, as rain or snow storms worsen. The average storm lasts 0.5 – 1 Minecraft day , and there is a 0.5 to 7.5 day delay between thunderstorms. They can be skipped entirely with the use of a bed .  Effects [ edit ]  As with rain and snow, the sky is darkened and the sun , moon , and stars are no longer visible. Thunderstorms darken the world, causing light from the sky to decrease to a level of 10 in full daylight (however, brightness is closer to a level 11.5 and is tinted blue). The clouds darken from white to a dark gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate or create lightning. While the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible. Unlike during regular rainstorms or snowstorms, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 5 for the purposes of hostile mob spawning, which allows hostile mobs to spawn at any time of the day.  Lightning [ edit ]     Lightning Bolt     Internal ID    JE : none BE : 93     Entity ID    lightning_bolt note: this is not a savegame ID, this is an alias for the purposes of the / summon command.      Lightning is a lethal element to thunderstorms. Lightning momentarily increases the sky light's brightness to slightly greater than full daylight.   The fire that a lightning bolt creates.  Lightning strikes randomly and creates fires where it strikes. Such fires act normally, igniting all flammable materials, detonating TNT , and even activating nether portals . The lightning itself however, is not destructive and will not destroy blocks. While most fires are extinguished by the rain, areas that block rain can allow the fire to spread, and any netherrack lit by lightning will not be extinguished by the rain. Most entities struck by lightning are dealt 5 ( ) damage, and are set on fire, which may cause additional damage. If lightning strikes a pig , it turns into a zombie pigman . If lightning strikes a creeper , it becomes charged . If lightning strikes a villager , it transforms into a witch .   A group of skeletal horsemen spawned during a thunderstorm.  Lightning may randomly spawn a "skeleton trap" skeletal horse , with a chance of 0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.8125–6.75% on Hard, depending on the regional difficulty . If the player is killed by a lightning strike, the death message will read "[player] was struck by lightning." However, this message will not display if the player was killed by the fire created by a lightning bolt. Lightning may be manually summoned with the / summon lightning_bolt command. While it is summoned as an entity, it cannot be referred to by commands or selectors . This may have changed as of 1.12.2.  Thunder [ edit ]  Thunder is a sound event that occurs every time lightning strikes. It can be heard by the player up to 160,000 blocks away from the position of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard instantly, regardless of the player's distance from the lightning strike itself.  Lightning mechanics [ edit ]  For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a 1 ⁄ 100,000 chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm. When lightning is to strike, random X and Z coordinates within the chunk are chosen, and the block just above the highest block that is liquid or blocks movement is chosen for the lightning strike. Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×3× h region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity is standing in. The target block is checked again for the following conditions:  Target block can see sky.  Rain (not snow) is falling in the target block. Thus, lightning does not naturally strike within cold biomes, or biomes where it does not rain (except in the Console Edition ).  If these conditions pass, lightning strikes. When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; damage immunity usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than 5 ( ) damage.

Are there any other effects from lightning strikes hitting other creatures IE: Will lightning hitting a zombie pigmen cause a special item to drop? Vanstrat 03:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC) I Don't Think it does any of those things but I sure hope Notch adds something like lightning rods that attract lightning. User:Skeptical Melon  –The preceding undated comment was added on 15:45, 23 April 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning hitting a creeper makes it become charged and more powerful, pigs that get hit by lightning get morphed into standard zombie pigmen, deals 2.5 damage if hit by lightning. -- R ocĸetor talk 21:21, 5 May 2011 (UTC)  Correct. Lightning has no affect on any other animals but creepers and pigs, aside from hurting them and lighting them on fire of course. – ultradude25  ( T | C ) at 05:15, 6 May 2011 (UTC)  If it causes sand and gravel to fall, surely it will cause other events triggered by block updates; maybe this should be mentioned but I'm not entirely certain so I shan't add it. 86.146.120.232 16:02, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  The sand falls because the fire gives a block update; and it only happens by floating sand. Pokechu22 23:15, 18 April 2013 (UTC)  Just to update the topic, in recent versions lightning can also turn a villager into a witch. -- MentalMouse42 ( talk ) 17:29, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  1.3.1 Changes [ edit ]  Is it just me, or are thunderstorms more common in 1.3.1? So far it has rained 3 times and 2 of them have been thunderstorms. CycloneChilli 19:08, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Fire [ edit ]  So you take damage from the fire, but it doesn't create real fire?
Does it set you on fire?
Have you seen it strike netherrack, as it's likely the rain puts out the fire? Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires. If lightning hits netherrack it will stay flaming. It just looks bad if there's a question with no answer :D -- R ocĸetor talk 09:31, 17 May 2011 (UTC)  Chances [ edit ]  How often do thunderstorms occur? Roughly how many times would it have to rain before there was a thunderstorm? PLEASE HELP! CycloneChilli 19:30, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  Likelihood [ edit ]  Is there a distinguishing factor that makes lightning strike in a certain place, if so it should be added to this wiki page. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Robeluke  ( Talk | Contribs ) 17:36, 22 April 2011.

It seems like a very minor difference, and feels highly judgmental. Darkid 01:03, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Long story short, there isn't. If something happens when lightning strikes, move it to effects. Tinaun 01:54, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Pigmen [ edit ]  I'm not sure but it doesn't appear that a pigman will take damage from the lightning strike itself.

CycloneChilli 19:11, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Is there any reason lightning shouldn't occur in a snow biome?  I can assure you that lightning does not require rain. -- 119.242.124.233 12:02, 23 February 2012 (UTC)  It does happen in this video -- assuming it is indeed natural. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrQLl9pufxU  Whatsifsowhatsit ( talk ) 19:37, 25 November 2013 (UTC)Whatsifsowhatsit  "Trivia: Lightning can go directly through blocks to hit the ground." [ edit ]  What does this phrase mean? How does Minecraft determine which blocks are the "ground" and which block are not the "ground"? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Jecowa  ( Talk | Contribs ) 04:59, 18 July 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   I haven't studied lightning storms or anything, but lightning can be targeted through the use of mods, and it can strike the bedrock through solid ground. I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?  Yilante 10 /28 /2012 6:31 pm 108.228.150.192 01:32, 29 October 2012 (UTC)  Name [ edit ]  If lightning bolt is an entity, what is its technical name? IllidanS4 16:54, 22 September 2011 (UTC)  Also, we need to know the entity ID for lightning. Can we make lightning spawners? :D –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 204.167.95.3  ( Talk ) 15:54, 18 November 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~  O: Lightning spawners?! Actually sounds kinda interesting. I hope Notch adds an ID to Lightning so we can investigate that theory. Wait no, Jeb is in charge of Minecraft for the time being... Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt
The only problem is that the SAVEGAME-Id's of the most technical entities are nowhere to find in the internet.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~  Yes it is possible, although very rare. I was struck by lightning from a thunderstorm while playing on a Beta 1.7.3 SMP server. It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire. It deals 3½ hearts of damage to the player. - Asterick6 22:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Charged Creeper??? [ edit ]  Open the page "Thunderstorm".

HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message.

[ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

[ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'. So you were right in your reading of the code! – Sealbudsman  talk / contr 03:06, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  Aaaaah If one could read correctly :P Thank you for clearing up, Superspace ! –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Entereloaded ( talk • contribs ) at 03:21, 26 July 2016 (UTC).

Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires.

I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC).

IllidanS4 16:54, 22 September 2011 (UTC)  Also, we need to know the entity ID for lightning. Can we make lightning spawners? :D –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 204.167.95.3  ( Talk ) 15:54, 18 November 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~  O: Lightning spawners?! Actually sounds kinda interesting. I hope Notch adds an ID to Lightning so we can investigate that theory. Wait no, Jeb is in charge of Minecraft for the time being... Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt
The only problem is that the SAVEGAME-Id's of the most technical entities are nowhere to find in the internet.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~  Yes it is possible, although very rare. I was struck by lightning from a thunderstorm while playing on a Beta 1.7.3 SMP server. It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire. It deals 3½ hearts of damage to the player. - Asterick6 22:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Charged Creeper??? [ edit ]  Open the page "Thunderstorm".

HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message.

[ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

[ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   I haven't studied lightning storms or anything, but lightning can be targeted through the use of mods, and it can strike the bedrock through solid ground. I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?

IllidanS4 16:54, 22 September 2011 (UTC)  Also, we need to know the entity ID for lightning.

Actually sounds kinda interesting. I hope Notch adds an ID to Lightning so we can investigate that theory. Wait no, Jeb is in charge of Minecraft for the time being... Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt

Please sign your posts with ~~~~  Yes it is possible, although very rare. I was struck by lightning from a thunderstorm while playing on a Beta 1.7.3 SMP server. It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire. It deals 3½ hearts of damage to the player. - Asterick6 22:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Charged Creeper??? [ edit ]  Open the page "Thunderstorm".

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Technically, Nether portals are activated by fire inside the portal frame. More fire does not deactivate them, so yes, the article was incorrect. Fixed. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Death Message [ edit ]  What is the death message if you die from lightning? Make sure it's the lightning that kills you and not the fire afterwards. HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message. Haven't actually tested in-game yet. -- Orthotope 20:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Light levels? When did it become 7? [ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

[ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'.

I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though.

It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?

While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?

Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC).

Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.

Will it power redstone dust?
Will lightning be attracted to iron blocks? (the cubes made with 9 pieces of iron ingots)
Are there any other effects from lightning strikes hitting other creatures IE: Will lightning hitting a zombie pigmen cause a special item to drop? Vanstrat 03:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC) I Don't Think it does any of those things but I sure hope Notch adds something like lightning rods that attract lightning. User:Skeptical Melon  –The preceding undated comment was added on 15:45, 23 April 2011. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning hitting a creeper makes it become charged and more powerful, pigs that get hit by lightning get morphed into standard zombie pigmen, deals 2.5 damage if hit by lightning. -- R ocĸetor talk 21:21, 5 May 2011 (UTC)  Correct. Lightning has no affect on any other animals but creepers and pigs, aside from hurting them and lighting them on fire of course. – ultradude25  ( T | C ) at 05:15, 6 May 2011 (UTC)  If it causes sand and gravel to fall, surely it will cause other events triggered by block updates; maybe this should be mentioned but I'm not entirely certain so I shan't add it. 86.146.120.232 16:02, 3 March 2012 (UTC)  The sand falls because the fire gives a block update; and it only happens by floating sand. Pokechu22 23:15, 18 April 2013 (UTC)  Just to update the topic, in recent versions lightning can also turn a villager into a witch. -- MentalMouse42 ( talk ) 17:29, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  1.3.1 Changes [ edit ]  Is it just me, or are thunderstorms more common in 1.3.1? So far it has rained 3 times and 2 of them have been thunderstorms. CycloneChilli 19:08, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  Fire [ edit ]  So you take damage from the fire, but it doesn't create real fire?
Does it set you on fire?
Have you seen it strike netherrack, as it's likely the rain puts out the fire? Darkid 10:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)  You probably already know this, but getting directly struck by lightning deals 2.5 hearts of damage. The rain puts out all fires except netherrack fires. If lightning hits netherrack it will stay flaming. It just looks bad if there's a question with no answer :D -- R ocĸetor talk 09:31, 17 May 2011 (UTC)  Chances [ edit ]  How often do thunderstorms occur?

It seems like a very minor difference, and feels highly judgmental. Darkid 01:03, 15 May 2011 (UTC)  Long story short, there isn't. If something happens when lightning strikes, move it to effects.

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   I haven't studied lightning storms or anything, but lightning can be targeted through the use of mods, and it can strike the bedrock through solid ground. I doubt it uses this ability much in normal gameplay, though. Father Toast 05:10, 18 July 2011 (UTC)  The ground is the ground. What it means is that Lightning aims towards the "ground" and will go through structures such as houses to get to it. 72.183.110.199 19:29, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  It means lightning can travel through transparent blocks until it hits an opaque block. -- Wolfeye68 ( talk ) 11:33, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  Lighting Level [ edit ]  This page is missing a single piece of data that is moderately important: While it is true that Thunderstorms decrease the lighting level to 7 during the day, what do they reduce it to at night? If it's the same level of light, then we should probably mention that explicitly. BobChao 16:16, 6 September 2011 (UTC)  I think it is reduced, but I wondered what amount? I think it's still 4 to be honest. CycloneChilli 19:23, 7 April 2012 (UTC)  I'll do the math. It has to be less then 7 because it's night, right? Has to be above 4 though. Depending on the time of night, that concludes it is either 5 or 6. 72.183.110.199 19:16, 8 December 2013 (UTC)  Valid lightning targets [ edit ]  I know the article states that it is possible for lightning to shoot through blocks, but the only evidence of this that I've found is when the lightning has been called by the player to a specified target using a mod.  It is important for anyone who builds wooden structures to know which blocks naturally-occurring lightning will target.  Does it only target the top block in one column of blocks?  Does it favor taller structures?  Could you lightning-proof a wooden structure by encasing it in transparent materials, such as a glass jar, or does it pass through transparent blocks? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 74.192.15.82  ( Talk ) 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   It is also worth noting that structures built from flammable materials in desert biomes are not safe from the fire, as there is no rain to put it out.  I would assume this is the case in snowy biomes too, or will be once they are re-implemented. 74.192.15.82 09:33, 20 September 2011 (UTC)  In desert biomes, there is NO lightning. You may see it strike in other biomes if you're near the edge, but it will NOT strike desert biome ground. CycloneChilli 19:28, 7 August 2012 (UTC)  If that is true then the line: "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." needs to be removed from Effects . Cultist O 11:31, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  And should then be replaced with the pre-existing (and contradictory to the-opposite): "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain."?

IllidanS4 16:54, 22 September 2011 (UTC)  Also, we need to know the entity ID for lightning.

Actually sounds kinda interesting. I hope Notch adds an ID to Lightning so we can investigate that theory. Wait no, Jeb is in charge of Minecraft for the time being... Jeb should implement the ID. 90.191.11.233 21:50, 13 June 2012 (UTC)  Even if it had an ID (which it doesn't appear to, as of 1.2.5), monster spawners can only produce living entities. Could be done with a mod, though. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Indeed, Single Player Commands allows you to do that, I believe. Btw 90.191.11.233 is actually me. MaryTheTiger 22:27, 19 June 2012 (UTC)  What we mean is that we could use the ID to spawn an “item” version of lightning that has the same functionality of game-spawned lightning. MaryTheTiger 19:40, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  In 12w34b it is possible to spawn non living entities like XPOrb via Mob cage. Note: for 1.8, it is LightingBolt

Please sign your posts with ~~~~  Yes it is possible, although very rare. I was struck by lightning from a thunderstorm while playing on a Beta 1.7.3 SMP server. It dealt like 7 hearts of damage or something and I think I caught on fire. I don't remember exactly how much. - Asterick6 22:20, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Nvm the ~7 hearts of damage was probably from the combined effects of the hit and the fire. It deals 3½ hearts of damage to the player. - Asterick6 22:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)  Charged Creeper??? [ edit ]  Open the page "Thunderstorm".

Yilante 10 /28 /12 6:28 pm 108.228.150.192 01:29, 29 October 2012 (UTC)  Charged creepers struck twice [ edit ]  The page says that creepers die after being hit a second time by lightning by "overload".

But the portal definitely is activated when lightning strikes the frame. Is the article wrong then? –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 75.132.35.214  ( Talk ) 22:15, 8 June 2012. Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Technically, Nether portals are activated by fire inside the portal frame. More fire does not deactivate them, so yes, the article was incorrect. Fixed. -- Orthotope 05:29, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  Death Message [ edit ]  What is the death message if you die from lightning? Make sure it's the lightning that kills you and not the fire afterwards. HotdogPi Come to my page! 17:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Looking at the code, it's considered the same type of damage as being in a fire, so you should get the 'went up in flames' message. Haven't actually tested in-game yet. -- Orthotope 20:10, 9 June 2012 (UTC)  Light levels? When did it become 7? [ edit ]  Unless I'm really senile, lightning in 1.2.5 was light level 10 (5 levels of sky darkening), not 7. Is this a 1.3 change? If so, should there be a history section? Also, a question on lighting and fire. 125 would not set something on fire (normal difficulty) during thunder, yet there is no mention of difficulty affecting fire in the article.
-- Keybounce 16:50, 15 August 2012 (UTC)  Thunderstorm without rain [ edit ]  Right now I am witnessing a thunderstorm WITHOUT rain. I'm in the JungleHills biome and for 64 blocks around me there is no desert. I play with OptiFine_1.3.2_HD_UB3  mod, weather is not switched off (I'm not hearing any sound of rain, besides). This is the first and so far the only time I see such weather effect. Had anybody else observed it? -- N21LV 17:33, 24 September 2012 (UTC) Probably way too late for you, but if you had recently updated at that time, while using a world from a previous version, the terrain generation system could have changed, placing your previous jungle biome into a desert biome. -- 98.114.242.134 19:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)  Lightning striking under overhangs [ edit ]  In Effects it says: "Overhangs can prevent rain from putting out lightning fires, allowing the fire to spread." and later in Trivia : "Forest fires made by lightning are rare unless the lightning strikes underneath a tree where the rain won't be able to extinguish the fire." How far under an overhang can lightning go, or how do you know whether lightning is able to hit a particular point? Cultist O 11:38, 7 October 2012 (UTC)  Desert [ edit ]  There's a discrepancy with deserts.  The Effects section lists lightning able to touch down in desert, while the Trivia says it can't. I assume this is due to a recent change, but can someone confirm what is correct and edit one of these entries? Direpinnacle 19:17, 6 December 2012 (UTC)  Lightning strikes within Desert biomes - yes or no? [ edit ]  As several others have previously noted here on the talk page, there continues to be a contradiction in the article between two sections: Under the 'Effects' section, it is stated, "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts, with no rain to extinguish fires." While, under the 'Trivia' section, the opposite is stated, "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes, nor does rain." Can someone with knowledge on the subject please clear this issue up and make appropriate edits? Thanks!  I have seen several comments about this with what I feel are iffy answers. I do not believe that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and both should potentially be left in the wiki, although it seems to have been changed since the last comments about this were made. Is it not possible for a lightning storm to occur in a biome adjacent to a desert biome and for lightning to come down from the adjacent biome that has an active thunderstorm to touch down in the desert biome that is not having a thunderstorm? This would make both statements "Lightning does not occur in desert biomes" and "Lightning can still touch down in dry biomes such as Deserts" true and therefore both be left in the wiki. This is only speculation and needs confirmation about whether or not it is actually possible for lightning to cross over the edge of the biome to land in the desert, though I cannot imagine why it can't happen.-- Reitrahc ( talk ) 23:41, 1 January 2015 (UTC) I just checked decompiled code for 1.8.2-pre1, and also tested it by modding the "chance for lightning strike" to 1 ⁄ 10 (versus 1 ⁄ 100000 ). Lightning only strikes where it is raining, so no strikes in dry or snowy biomes (including Extreme Hills above the snow line). The fire resulting from the strike might overflow into an adjacent biome, of course, but the lightning itself won't. Anomie x ( talk ) 13:56, 2 January 2015 (UTC)  User:Reitrahc 's proposal would be confusing anyway, since it isn't obvious that thunderstorms have a point of origin rather than being global, nor that they can cross biome borders. Seahen ( talk ) 01:42, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  Thunderstorm=More Loot? [ edit ]  I've noticed that during thunderstorms, mobs with better gear spawn. For instance, normally skeletons only show up with enchanted bows once in a blue moon- it's a regular occurence during thunderstorms. Also, zombies seem to have a better chance of spawning with armor or other stuff during a thunderstorm. 
I've only tested this with a Superflat world and artificially induced thunderstorms. Can someone do full testing on this? 75.189.153.145 21:44, 17 April 2013 (UTC)  Power by Lightning [ edit ]  Could, in theory, lightning be used for a power supply?  Since it can activate inactive redstone and fry active redstone, (like real world lightning will do to electrical objects), then couldn't it, par-say, be used for a redstone power supply?  I will be doing some experiments to find this out.  The experiments will involve large towers made of varying materials and layered in redstone wire in a grid pattern.  These will be one block wide but will go all the way up to 2 blocks away from the height limit so I can put redstone on top.  These will then be hooked up to a meter just like the one seen on the daylight sensor page.  If I can get a signal on the ground from a lightning strike to the tower then however long the meter stays on for will determine if this is possible.  The material may make a difference so I will be doing lots of experiments with different materials for the tower but all will be layered in redstone.  I hope this works. Brickticks ( talk ) 20:03, 25 October 2013 (UTC)  That won't work. Blocks don't attract lightning, although players wearing a full set of iron armor have a higher chance of being struck. Lightning won't power redstone, and I tested this by changing to hard difficulty in 1.7.2 wearing a full set of iron armor. The lightning struck some redstone dust, and it did nothing. Meeples10 t ~ c 21:30, 27 October 2013 (UTC)  I'm still going to try, it may take a while but eventually some lightning will strike, I can't control the weather and neither can you, so there is no way that you can be sure that it won't work.  Besides, it might be that the redstone dust that you saw get struck was fried, not powered, so yeah.  It says that the lightning can power or deactivate, (fry), redstone dust so you might have seen the dust get fried not powered, like in the real world, wires can be forcibly powered by lightning for forcibly turn off and destroyed or "fried", so that's what you might have seen.  Thank you, goodbye. Brickticks ( talk ) 02:28, 29 October 2013 (UTC)  This is Minecraft , a game, in which you can go into the code and modify it, and thus able to modify/ control the weather. And no, I checked other sources and the coding itself; there is no correlation with lightning and powering redstone. I'm going to delete that info right now, along with many others; there are so many speculations and false info on this page. But hey, that feature is very appealing. -- Neutral0814 ( talk ) 05:39, 18 November 2013 (UTC)  I've tried (in 1.8.2-pre6) using /summon to trigger a lightning bolt on a wire, connected to a redstone lamp 2 blocks away. It didn't blink on. (I'd already used /weather thunder, so this bolt did indeed arrive during a storm.) That tells me that lightning doesn't generate spurious redstone signals (except possibly in situations where fires from other causes would do so). Seahen ( talk ) 02:10, 2 February 2015 (UTC)  I have a question, again. [ edit ]  O.K. so, didn't there used to be a command string for getting/forcing lightning to strike a certain place?  I think it was something that involved a command for lightning and then some coordinates, I think.  Does anybody know what that was, or am I just going crazy? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
Oh, I just thought of something, didn't it have something to do with the spawn command, or am i just going crazier? Brickticks ( talk ) 20:11, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  Only possible with mods. Lightning doesn't have an entity ID, so it can't be created with /summon . -- Orthotope talk 20:47, 22 May 2014 (UTC)  You can use /summon to create lightning in snapshot 14w30+. -- 812402 ( talk ) 12:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)  Definition of the lighting bolt [ edit ]  There seems to be some contingency on the definition of a lighting bolt, according to the code, such events are classed on the "entity" superclass which includes all regular entities, it is also created with a uuid, however lighting bolts are incapable of doing things like catching on fire, having health, or other things. This potentially means that the definition of entities is flawed and should be tweaked, it is important to do this because currently there is much needless discussion on whether or not lighting bolts are entities. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.4 ( talk ) at 23:25, 11 December 2014 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   As lightning bolts are the only entity that behaves like that, I say we should treat them as an exception rather than a rule. I don't see the point in redefining the definition of an entity just because a single one does not fit the case, rather it can simply be said lightning is an entity, but does not display the standard entity behaviors. – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 23:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)  Some reference material relevant to the root of the discussion - here -- Bb 20 (Edits) 01:00, 12 December 2014 (UTC)  I agree however I am unable to understand the format of the wiki and therefore I would request someone more qualified to add the little note in the thunderstorm article. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 187.189.164.91 ( talk ) at 14:52, 12 December 2014 (UTC).

Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Lightning can strike in any loaded chunk, as would be expected (why load a chunk to randomly start fires). – KnightMiner  ( t · c ) 00:57, 19 January 2015 (UTC)  Frequency? [ edit ]  It says 1/100000 per tick per chunk, which with the usual 81 chunks and 20 ticks would mean roughly one per minute. This can't be right at all. True, sometimes when I was somewhere in a swamp I get them pretty rarely, but right now I'm in a hills biome and I am getting up to 3 PER SECOND.
I do have Thaumcraft installed, but I doubt Thaumcraft does that. I'm still gonna ask them about this. –Preceding unsigned comment was added by 87.178.81.201 ( talk ) at 11:56, 18 December 2015 (UTC). Please sign your posts with ~~~~   Believe it or not, the code says 1/100000 per chunk per tick. 81 chunks seems small though. Anomie x ( talk ) 12:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)  Lighting [ edit ]  Superspace : In your recent rewrite, you introduced claims that lighting reduces to 7 during thunderstorms and that mobs spawn as if the light level were 7, including a history entry for 1.7.2. Both of these seem to be incorrect.  Sky light level is determined by what MCP calls World.calculateSkylightSubtracted . During full daylight, the calculation is floor(11 * (1.0 − ([sunlight] 1.0 * [rain decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0) * [storm decrease] (1.0 - (1.0 * 5.0) / 16.0)))) = 5 , giving a light level of 10, not 7. This appears to go back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  As for rendering brightness , at gamma=0 full sky light with 0 block light gives rgb(0.46,0.46,0.61), which is between the rgb(0.43,0.43,0.43) for normal daylight level 11 and the rgb(0.63,0.63,0.63) for normal daylight level 12, again not anywhere near level 7. This goes back to at least 1.8, and considering the similarities in the code to the formula for the sky light subtraction I'd be surprised if it was different in 1.7.2.  The mob spawning change is in what MCP calls EntityMob.isValidLightLevel , which is what enforces the "hostile mobs only spawn in darkness" constraint. When thunderstorming, it temporarily overrides the sky light subtraction value to 10 which means an effective light level of 5, not 7. This goes back to beta 1.5 when weather was added.  Anomie x ( talk ) 12:00, 21 June 2016 (UTC)  Thunderstorm - Altitude - Biom [ edit ]  Hi there, the Wiki page states that Altitude and Biom tenoerature influence the quantity of thunderbolts.
<Um, so I think this is how 2 refenrence sb? Superspace was the person adding this info?! >
I do not find any other source for that tho. I found the place in the code checking if the potential spawning spot is rained on, but other than that no reference to altutude nor temperature. At no point I found a reference to the present biom. I am extremely unskilled in reading the code tho. This was my first attempt. 'Is anybody out there' who could provide me with information about this temerature/alltitude dependende? -- Entereloaded ( talk ) 02:44, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  The page says it's the 'type of precipitation' (rain or snow) of the storm that changes with biome temp and altitude.  Not the 'quantity of thunderbolts'. So you were right in your reading of the code! – Sealbudsman  talk / contr 03:06, 26 July 2016 (UTC)  Aaaaah If one could read correctly :P Thank you for clearing up, Superspace ! –Preceding unsigned comment was added by Entereloaded ( talk • contribs ) at 03:21, 26 July 2016 (UTC).

I was wondering something.   There is a way to make it so creepers can become "charged", and once they are charged I THINK they drop more gunpowder, exciperence, and they increase the chances for mob heads to spawn in game once they are killed. Which is neat becuase it will let me have a production of mob heads to (and maybe player heads!)   I saw on a youtube video some guy making a charged creeper farm, and basically how he set it up is, he has boats on a top roof to further increase the chances of lightning spawning there. I wanted to know if it was true though.   Here is the video link, its a little outdated but I think its still a thing in Minecraft            Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack     Hey you!

I've certainly never heard of them having a different loot table from normal creepers and the wiki doesn't say anything about that.  As for XP, again I think it's the same as a normal creeper since they are a variant of normal creepers.  They certainly aren't listed on the XP page on the wiki , which could be an oversight I suppose.

If they intersect (i.e. its raining and it's thundering) you have a thunder storm.  When this happens there is a chance that a lightning bolt will spawn per tick (something like 1 in 100000 if I remember the code correctly).  On a single player server the strike will occur nearby the player.  On multiplayer it will strike around one of the players.

About the only control you have that will optimize your chances where lightning will strike is to reduce your render distance so the lightning has a smaller space to strike in.

Here is a much better farm you can use (can be scaled). Keep in mind that all charged creeper farms are pretty damn slow, especially when thunderstorms are rare in the first place.

This will not work because the chance of lighting striking is per chunk - fewer chunks loaded will actually decrease the number of lighting strikes in a given time interval - but the number per unit area (chunk) remains the same:  For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a 1/100000 chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm.   http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Thunderstorm#Lightning_mechanics  So, for example, with a render distance of 10 you'll have 441 chunks loaded so the chance of a lightning strike is 441/100000 or once every 11.33 seconds (I believe that lightning does not strike in the outermost chunks so this is probably more. In 1.6.4 the active chunk radius is always 7 for 225 active chunks and one strike every 22.2 seconds regardless of view or render distance).  The most important factor is to make sure they are spread out - lightning does not have to directly strike them:  Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×3×h region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity is standing in...  ...When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×6×12 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning.  Basically, spacing them every 6 blocks would ensure that at one will get struck by lightning; with a smaller spacing you can get more at once (since lightning favors hitting entities it will likely strike one and only affect any others within 3 blocks to the north and west or 2 blocks to the south and east of the target block). Also, since lightning can affect entities 3 blocks below a ceiling it is possible to have an indoor farm (this is also why villagers can be turned into witches despite appearing to be safe).

Charged creepers only occur when struck by lighting. If you put them in your spawn chunks, you can expect to get one after maybe a week of real life gameplay. It's quite uncommon.   Once you get one, use it to blow up a creeper, skeleton or zombie. You'll get a creeper, skeleton or zombie head, respectively. These have no real use in game, but they're pretty.

I recently had my first charged creeper in survival, and obtained a zombie skull via it. Now I'm eager to get the others. But the only obvious way to me seemed to be to obtain a load of name tags (I have a few librarian villagers who trade them), and create some 2 deep pits in a nice flattish area of a single chunk with a tallish observation platform in the middle, and whenever the specifc mob whose skull you want spawns in a pit, name him so he wont despawn and repeat this til you have a good few scattered around, and then hope next time there's a storm, get on your observation platform, and with the increased saturation of your chosen mob, you might get lucky. But it does seem impractical and a waste in the long run of name tags.   I have an observation platform in a partially cleared swamp biome, and I use it for locating and hunting slimes. It was on their during a thunderstorm that heard a lightning strike near me, looked over and there was the charged creeper! But I've also got a lot of wild pigs roaming around which I haven't penned in, and I've had two zombie pigmen created from lightning strikes since, so thae name tag idea would increase your chances (you can approach a mob with an invisibility potion and no armour and it wont see you to tag it - that's how I named my charged creeper and lured him later to a temp set up near my base where I detonated him with a zombie)           Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack                 #3   Sep 21, 2015           rodabon    rodabon      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  Enderdragon Slayer  Join Date: 10/27/2010   Posts: 11,275   Member Details           In addition to what Derman said, you can use mob sorting on a mob trap to sort out creepers to put in a designated area and wait for a thunder storm.  With the steady supply of creepers and if you're close enough for them to not despawn you increase your chances to about maximum possible in a legit survival scenario.

Lightning strikes are completely random, and when and where they strike are not affected by anything (Except for the fact that there is or isn't a current thunder storm). A good idea (Requires many nametags) is to trap Creepers in a spread out area, the more you have revealed to the surface, the more likely it is to strike one. But adding more Creepers doesn't directly affect lightning. It just gives it more 'targets' to hit.

The space between every hole is then 6 blocks, since lightning strikes always on a 3 by 3 blocks space, and some players even surround the edges of every hole with netherrack, to see right away if it is hit. So that is a way to have a little bit more change of getting a lightning creeper. However, luring a creeper in such a hole and nametag it can be quite tricky and dangerous and such a farm does only increase luck for real if it is very large and if every hole has a creeper in it.

I'm in a new world and there hasn't been any rain since i started (about 2 months). I'm NOT  asking if there is a way to make it rain more often. But unfortunately i'm on a VERY hilly place :/ looks like i will just have to wait until i actually get rain and hopefully it's a thunderstorm           Rollback Post to Revision   RollBack                   #8   Jan 17, 2015           RobertFrans    RobertFrans      View User Profile       View Posts       Send Message                  A Space Odyssey  Join Date: 1/19/2013   Posts: 2,418   Location: The Netherlands   Member Details          Do you sleep at night? Because everytime you sleep, the weather gets a reset. So if you sleep every night, it will never rain. And as a sidenote: biomes and landscapes do not influence the weather.

Forcing a creeper to get struck by lighting is very difficult because lightning is random.    On a side note, I was playing some multiplayer with my friends and we saw a charged creeper.    Good luck by the way!

There should be reasons to stay inside.  And seeing how illnesses would be a bit on the complex side for minecraft, this would work perfectly.   seems like the code would be easy enough to make, as well. Just shift the lightning strikes x blocks closer to the player for every y amount of armor...  although, I don't know how the RNG they used for lightning works, so I could be wrong.

Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet.

After escaping the bedrock I saw that it was built in a very similar place to where I had made a mob farm on my single player game. I then checked the seed and it was exactly the same. I made my world with a random seed and just wanted to know what the chances of that were. Just a random thought I had in my head.  P.s. I would try to provide some proof to this but it was like 2 years ago and i don't have either save and I just felt like sharing this.

Create an account [–] bilde2910  29 points 30 points 31 points  2 years ago *  (6 children) EDIT: The chance of an adventure map having the exact same seed as the only Minecraft world you've ever generated is 1/2 48 , or about twelve times as unlikely as explained below. To put this into perspective, it's almost the same likelihood as being bitten by a shark and being struck by lightning on the same day . The below explanation assumes OP has 10 worlds and that the seed of one of them matched the seed of another of them. It might be worth a read regardless.   Seeds in Java are stored as 64-bit integers, however, the implementation only uses 48 of those bits . 48 bits can form 2 48 (or 281,474,976,710,656) unique numbers. While at first it may seem like getting two identical seeds is impossible, even within, say, 10 million years, the birthday problem makes things more interesting. However, the probabilities are still ridiculous on a practical scale.  With the number of different possible seeds above, there's a 10% chance that at least one seed will match at least one other seed from a selection of 7.7 million randomly generated seeds. This means that if you had generated one new world every second, you'd only need to keep going for just under 3 months to get a 10% chance that at least one of those worlds is identical to at least one other of those worlds. If you wanted, say, a 50% chance of a match, you'd need to do this for 7.5 months, and if you wanted a 90% chance, you need to keep going for a little over a year. Given the amount of worlds generated worldwide since Minecraft's birth, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the worlds are identical in terms of seeds.  However, that's on a global scale. The actual probability for any single person to generate the same world twice is so small I don't even know if it can be compared to anything in a realistic manner. The probability for any given person to select the same value twice from 2 48 possible values on 10 attempts (10 generated worlds, and if my calculations are correct) is 4.44 × 10 -14 (where 0 means it will never happen and 1 means it will certainly happen), or, when put as a percentage, 0.000000000004%.  So how does this compare to (relatively) mundane things? You are:   6 million times more likely to be bitten by a shark at some point in your life  7.5 billion times more likely to be struck by lightning  128,000 times more likely to win the next Powerball grand prize  728 million times more likely to be dealt a royal flush in your next game of Texas Hold'em  Roughly as likely to be bitten by a shark and be struck by lightning within two weeks.   Of course, my calculations may be incorrect, so it would be great if someone could double check these calculations. I'm sure there are better mathematicians out there than me.   permalink embed save give gold [–] CraftedBot  9 points 10 points 11 points  2 years ago *  (0 children) /r/theydidthemath  EDIT: Actually, you should post this story there to see what they manage or to ask someone to double check your calculations.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Jenoxide  4 points 5 points 6 points  2 years ago  (1 child)  While at first it may seem like getting two identical seeds is impossible, even within, say, 10 million years, the birthday problem makes things more interesting.   That doesn't really apply to what OP has been asking. The seed of given adventure map is a static one, and the chances of having another map with the same seed is exactly (number of possible seeds)^(-1) . No birthday paradox here.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] bilde2910  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I knew I had done something wrong..  I have actually not noticed until now that one of the maps was an adventure map. I might have accidentally calculated the chances that one user randomly generated two worlds with the same seed. You're right that the chance of a random seed equaling a static seed isn't a birthday paradox, it is indeed 2 -48 . The probability in this case is roughly 1/12 of the probability outlined in my comment above. So in OP's case, it is almost as likely to be struck by lightning and bitten by a shark in a single day as it is to randomly generate the world used in the adventure map. Thanks for pointing this out!   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] andrew28_reddit  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Someone give this man a gold   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] TheSteveKiller  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) How 3 months multiple by 5 is 7.5 months?  Also liked those calculations at the end there XD  Even if they are not true :P   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] bilde2910  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) This is because of how the birthday paradox does weird things to probability. As you add more random selections, the probability for a shared value being selected increases exponentially at first and then levels out in the same fashion. Here's a graph for illustration.  Basically, if there are two people in a class, the probability for both of them to have the same birthday is obviously 1/365. The more people you have, the quicker the probability increases. However, once you get past a certain point, the whole thing switches from exponential-like growth to logarithmic-like growth. Assuming a year always has 365 days (i.e. ignoring February 29th), even if you had 365 students in a class, there's still a tiny chance that all of the students have different birthdays, although that chance is really, really small. The only way to guarantee that multiple people have birthday on the same day is to have one more person than the number of days in a year. That person has to have a birthday on the same day as someone else, as there are no remaining free dates on the calendar.  If you look at the illustration above, you'll be able to see that the number of people at P=0.1 (n=9) isn't 1/5 of the number of people at P=0.5 (n=23). Based on n at P=0.1, you'd expect n at P=0.5 to be 45, though in reality it's only 23, due to the birthday paradox. In summary, it's because the birthday paradox makes probability non-linear (i.e. not a straight line).  Wikipedia probably does a better job of explaining this than I do.  P means probability and n means number of values/persons, FYI   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Herxheim  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (3 children) it's way more likely you copied the seed and forgot about it.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Kedama  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (2 children) He downloaded an adventure map by someone else   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Master_1398  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) What if both maps where generated with the same version and with the same seed, let's say 1.2.5 and "MyAwesomeSeed"?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] TheMinecraft13  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) OP's world used a random seed.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] liquid_at  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (2 children) If you tend to write seeds by hand, there's a chance you had an idea for the same word. the word gets translated into numbers.  If you take a random seed, it takes the current timestamp to generate that seed. So it's extremely unlikely that you get 2 similar seeds. Before you could add it by hand, people said it was impossible to get a world twice.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Some seed inputs can be hashed to same world seed.   permalink embed save parent [–] liquid_at  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) As I said. If he manually puts in the seed, there is a chance. If he always picked a random seed, it's very unlikely.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (2 children) Well looking at how many possible seeds there are the chanses that 2 people who know each other getting the same seed or on your case that a map had the same seed as yours is very small since we'll you got a bilion seeds I guess not that I know for sure how many but it's a huge number.   permalink embed save [–] CraftedBot  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (1 child) According to bilde2910's numbers, the amount of possible seeds is:   2 48 (or 281,474,976,710,656) unique numbers   Which is about 280 trillion   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Wow that's allot I knew it was allot but this is insane much   permalink embed save parent [–] Hatchling13  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago *  (0 children) Conjectures on what happened:   The "best seeds" - the map maker was into seeds when he planned the map, so he seached for some seeds online, found a popular one and used it, and you used the same popular seed at the time, just a month before.  The "hash colision" - Both you and the map maker generate worlds typing the seeds, and some seeds that are not the full number translates into the same number, this is called a hash colision, what probably happened is that both of you used, either the same word-seed or one that, when translated to the numeric seed, ended on the same number  The "lottery" - he just generated a world with the same seed as yours, which is a unlikely coincidence due to the insane amount of seed possibilities.   EDIT: another conjecture (its just one, i just break into two parts)   The "Pseudo Random" - Most random numbers generated on computers, maybe all of them, are not completely random, they are pseudo-random. This basically is: given a seed (not a minecraft seed, a random number generator [RNG] seed) a random function can generate a random number, and then generate other random numbers in sequence, the problem is: given a sequence of random results from a seed X, if you get a new sequence from the same seed, it will be the same sequence  What could have happened is that somehow, when you generated your world, the RNG seed was the same as the RNG seed when the map maker generated his world, this could make the coincidence of two same seeds on different random generated worlds significantly less unlikely depending on how the RNG seed is/was generated.    permalink embed save give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

There are a few different types of weather effects, which only occur in the Overworld . Weather may have positive or negative effects on the environment, Mobs or Players .  Contents [ show ]  Rain  Rain is a semi-common weather occurrence and is one of the two possible forms of precipitation. When it is raining, blue Particles streak directly down from the sky until they come into contact with a surface. Small blue particles are left for a few seconds when individual droplets hit the ground (similar to how drops can seep through blocks when seen from below).      During a rainstorm the ambient light level drops.    Monsters cannot spawn in the rain during daylight (light level 12). Rain will extinguish Fire upon the surface of the overworld, and even mobs that may happen to be on fire. Rain cannot be heard near the Bedrock layer of a world. Passive mobs will jump up and down, trying to keep dry. On multiplayer servers, players can toggle between rain and clear skies using the " toggledownfall " command .    Thunderstorms  Thunderstorms (sometimes called Thunder or Lightning ) are a special type of weather. They are considered dangerous because they not only make the environment dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn, but have various effects on certain mobs, nearly all of which are bad for a player. Pigs , if hit by lightning become Zombie Pigmen , Villagers become Witches , and Creepers become a variant known as "Charged Creepers". Lightning can also set blocks on Fire . If lightning strikes within a few blocks/meters of any mob, they lose health. As of The Combat Update , a lighning may spawn a Skeleton Trap Horse . These spawn aditional horsemen when a player comes near them.  Snow  Snow falls occasionally in cold Biomes , such as the Ice Plains Biome , Ice Plains Spikes Biome , and Cold Taiga Biomes . Snow can also occur in the Extreme Hills Biome , at high altitudes. Snow can cover the land with a layer, creating "ice caps" on the mountains of an Extreme Hills biome.  Overcast  Overcast occurs in dry biomes, such as Deserts , Savannas , and Mesa Biomes . While it does not rain in those biomes, the light level will still drop and the Sun and Moon become shrouded, so a player can only tell their position with a clock . Overcast can be a useful sign that weather is occurring elsewhere while a player is in a Desert, Savanna or Mesa.  Trivia  Since thunderstorms are darker than rain , it is possible for mobs to spawn at any time of Daytime or Night . Players can still sleep during a thunderstorm, even during the daytime. It is very rare, but possible for a lightning bolt to activate a Nether Portal . If a "Charged Creeper" is struck by lightning again, it dies. This is because lightning deals damage. Rain can deal damage to Endermen , Blazes and Snow Golems . If Endermen are out in the Overworld during a rain storm, they will rapidly teleport around randomly as they attempt to find a spot where they won't get wet. Weather was introduced to Minecraft in Beta 1.5 . Weather can be changed using " weather " command . To use the weather command a player must type: /weather <clear/rainy/stormy> . The console will then announce: "Turning to (rainy/stormy/clear)". When the Sun is visible, it can be considered "clear weather". Leaving a Cauldron in the rain, may cause it to fill up with water, if a block tick hits the cauldron. This onlyhas a small chance of occurring. A block of Farmland may become hydrated during a rainfall.  Gallery  A "Charged" Creeper A Zombie Pigman Lightning strikes a tree. Lightning in Minecraft . Lightning in Minecraft .
