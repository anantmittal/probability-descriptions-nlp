View Images      Most bear attacks happen when people get too close to bears. Here, a photographer shoots photos of a brown bear in Alaska.    Photograph by Roy Toft, National Geographic Creative            PUBLISHED September 16, 2015     From the mountains of Maryland to the swamps of Florida to the snowy peaks of the U.S. West, bears are making a comeback.   Thanks to regulated hunting and more habitat, "there's a pretty dramatic increase in bear populations across the U.S., and people are going to be encountering bears more and more," says Dave Garshelis, bear project leader at the Minnesota Department of  Natural Resources. (Related: " Black Bears Are Rebounding—What Does That Mean For People? ")   In August, a grizzly bear killed a hiker in Yellowstone National Park—a tragic yet extremely rare event, experts say. The chances of being injured by a bear are approximately 1 in 2.1 million, according to the National Park Service . In other words, you're more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear.    Living With the Wild. As bear populations rebound across the United States, and as people increasingly move into their habitat, bear-human run-ins are inevitable. This is one of several stories asking: How do we live with the predators ?   To gain more insight into bear attacks and how to prevent them, scientists recently completed a study—not yet published—examining 675 bear attacks on people. Their research revealed distinct patterns of bear behavior that can help people stay safe in bear habitat.   “There is a lot of mythology out there about why bear attacks happen,” says Tom Smith , a biologist at Brigham Young University in Utah.   “If I wanted to make a key point, it is that the vast majority of these negative encounters are avoidable. People don’t need to go out into bear country and get hurt, nor do bears. These incidents are largely preventable, but humans have to take more responsibility.”   Here's how to be smart in bear habitat—whether it's in the deep wilderness or your own backyard.   Know your bears.   North America is home to three bear species: The black bear , brown bear (a species that includes the grizzly bear) , and polar bear .                Range of polar bear (Ursus maritimus)     Range of brown bear (Ursus arctos)     Range of American black bear (Ursus americanus)             arctic  Ocean    Greenland    canada    North  america    Pacific  Ocean    United  States    atlantic  Ocean    500 mi    mexico    500 km        NG STAFF     Find out which species live in the place where you live or plan to travel. Some places, such as Montana's Glacier National Park , are home to both grizzlies and black bears. It can be difficult to tell them apart, since black bears can also be brown, like grizzlies. However, black bears are generally smaller.  Notably, Smith says, brown bears inflicted more injuries than any other species in Alaska. The average brown bear encounter is more dangerous—3.5 times more likely to result in injury—than the average polar bear encounter, and 21 times more dangerous than the average black bear encounter, according to Smith and colleague Stephen Herrero, professor emeritus at the University of Calgary in Canada.  More than half of the attacks in the new analysis were over in less than three minutes, “consistent with the notion that the primary motivation for attacking bears is to neutralize a perceived threat, and once that is done they go on their way,” Smith says.  Don't unwittingly attract them.  Bears have a better sense of smell than dogs and love humans' food. So the main strategy to avoid run-ins is to minimize any scents or attractants on your body, campsite, or property.  "If you're a hiker, be more careful about various kind of scents and things that you would have on you," such as food, deodorant, and even chewing gum, Garshelis says.  Carry bear spray.  "The absolute best thing" to prevent a bear attack, particularly for grizzlies, is to use bear spray, a type of pepper spray, Garshelis says. (See " What Happens to Problem Bears That Go to Rehab? ")  He recommends people practice in advance how to operate the spray, including being familiar with far it shoots. (Practice outdoors and upwind; bear spray is powerful stuff.) He also says a person traveling in bear country should wear the spray on a holster in front of their bodies, so that they're not fumbling for it if they run smack into a grizzly.  In a 2008 study that also involved Smith and Herrero, scientists found that bear spray was 92 percent effective in deterring attacks from the three species of North American bear in Alaska between 1985 and 2006. Ninety-eight percent of people carrying bear spray who got into close encounters with bears were uninjured.      Travel in groups.  Being alone in the wilderness can be fulfilling, but for safety's sake it's better to walk in a group of three people or more, he says. A bear is more likely to retreat if it sees or smells several people walking toward it than if a single person approaches. (See "Why Are Black Bear Attacks Up in Florida? ")  "For the most part, they want to avoid us," he says.  Of the people injured by bears in Yellowstone National Park since 1970, 91 percent were hiking alone or with one other person .  If dogs are allowed in the area where you'll be, it's generally a good idea to bring them, since the canines often scare away bears. However, this approach can backfire: If a dog is ahead of its owner and then runs into a bear, the bear may chase it, which is not only dangerous to the dog but could endanger humans if the dog runs back to its owner.  Be alert for signs of bears.  If you see fresh scat, for instance, a bear has recently passed by. "It's a good idea to be very alert. Think through, 'How am I going to react?'"  Don't let yourself fall into a daze, either—stay present and look around as you walk.  If you're attacked or pursued, react according to the species of bear.  "Typically if you're in a place where there's just black bears, you would be bold and aggressive to a bear that approaches you," says Garshelis. Throwing things, standing tall, and yelling will drive away most black bears—although that strategy isn't foolproof.  "I've seen pretty scary videos where black bears have actually attacked people when they're doing everything right," he says. "Nothing's 100 percent." (Related: " What Do You Do With a Bear That Kills a Person ?")  If you run into a grizzly, your approach should be the opposite: Backing away slowly and getting away from the situation without provoking the animal, he says.  That's especially true with female grizzly bears with cubs, which can be particularly dangerous. (See " Video of Yellowstone Bear Chasing Tourists Isn't What You Think .")  When threatened, female grizzlies will often stand up, slap the ground, and make blowing sounds. However, "that means it's nervous; it's not aggressive," he says.  In Smith and Herrero's analysis of 675 bear attacks in Alaska, the vast majority of incidents in which bears charged occurred when people and bears confronted each other at close range, within ten yards (nine meters) or less.  In more than 50 percent of those situations, the person was not physically hurt. Of the 313 cases in which the bears injured the person, 36 percent of injuries were to legs and feet, 18 percent to the back, 18 percent to arms, and 9 percent to head and neck.  Never run.  "You can't outrun a bear," Garshelis says. "The best thing to do is walk away slowly from a bear if it already clearly sees you."  Keep watching the animal as you walk away, and some experts suggest speaking out loud in a calm voice.          WATCH: A bear can go from disinterested to dangerous in an instant. Do you know what to do if you're attacked by a startled grizzly?       Know when to play dead.  Only play dead after a bear has made contact with you.   If it's a black bear, try to fight back. If that strategy doesn't work, lay on your stomach (protecting your vital organs), clasp your hands on the back of your neck, and pull up your knees. At this point, the bear may give up and leave.  If it's a grizzly, do not try to defend yourself. "Once it's on you, and there's nothing else you can do, collapse and play dead," Garshelis says.  Since 1970, Yellowstone National Park has tracked bear encounters and found that those who play dead when attacked by a bear during a surprise encounter only got minor injuries 75 percent of the time . Those who fought back, on the other hand, suffered severe injuries 80 percent of the time.  The analysis by Smith and Herrero also revealed that things don't always end well for the bear: In 600 physical run-ins with people, bears died 34 percent of the time from injury incurred during the incident or from subsequent management actions.  Be tolerant and put things in perspective.  "Tolerance goes a long way to living with wildlife," Garshelis says.  For instance, if you're a homeowner and like to put out birdseed, consider doing it in the winter, when birds really need it and when bears are hibernating—otherwise you could have an unwelcome visitor.  Also remember that bear encounters can be enjoyable, as long as you keep your distance. (See National Geographic's best bear pictures .)

Bear attack   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Although rare, bear attacks can be fatal.    A bear attack is an attack by any mammal of the family Ursidae , on another animal, although it usually refers to bears attacking humans or domestic pets. Bear attacks are of particular concern for those who are in bear habitats. They can be fatal and often hikers, hunters, fisherman, and others in bear country take precautions against bear attacks.  According to Taylor Y. Cardall and Peter Rosen, in their article "Grizzly Bear Attack" published in the Journal of Emergency Medicine , there were 162 bear-inflicted injuries reported in the United States between 1900 and 1985. This constitutes approximately two reported bear-inflicted injuries per year. [1] Likewise, Stephen Herrero , a Canadian biologist, reports that during the 1990s bears killed around three people a year in the U.S. and Canada, as compared to the 15 people killed every year by dogs . [2] Multiple reports remark that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to be attacked by a bear when outdoors; around 90 people are killed by lightning each year. [3] However, with the increase in habitat destruction, interactions between bears and humans have increased and one would expect bear attacks to likewise be on the rise.

According to Wild Bears of the Worlds , by Paul Ward and Suzanne Kynaston, human contact with bears has existed since the time of the Neanderthals and the European cave bear around 200,000 to 75,000 years ago. [4] There is some evidence of cave bear worship during these early years: between the years 1917 and 1922, Emil Bachler discovered a large stone chest filled with cave bear skulls in the Drachenloch Cave, one of the Wildkirchli ; between 1916 and 1922, Konrad Hormann found narrow niches filled with five cave bear skulls. [4] However, at these sites, there have been little evidence of any human presence, and so some scientists have come to regard such discoveries as the result of some natural cause. [4]  Ward and Kynaston go on to report that Cro-Magnon humans, who first appeared nearly 35,000 years ago, show more obvious evidence of cave bear worship in the forms of paintings, sculptures, and engravings; however, there is still some doubt as to whether these works specifically depict the cave bear or the European brown bear. [5]  In the 1900s, bear populations had been decreasing because of increased hunting of bears for sustenance (done mostly by native peoples such as the Inupiat of Alaska and the Inuvialuit of Canada) and for trophy prizes. [6] Polar bear skins became popular as a sign of wealth and prestige, especially in Europe during the Victorian era. [7] Comparatively, the pelts of giant panda , were also highly valued, priced at around 176,000 U.S. dollars. [8]  More recently, laws have been instated to protect the dwindling populations of bears; however, as stated in Return of the Grizzly by David Whitman, these laws have increased the tensions between bears and humans. While this allows bear populations to recuperate, it also prevents people from killing bears that have invaded their property and killed their livestock. [9]  Species, and respective aggressiveness [ edit ]  American black bears [ edit ]     Damage done by a black bear to a car door in Yosemite Valley    Unlike grizzly bears, which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled in. Black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans, and usually limit themselves to making mock charges, emitting blowing noises and swatting the ground with their forepaws. However, according to Stephen Herrero in his Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance , 23 people were killed by black bears from 1900 to 1980. The number of black bear attacks on humans is higher than those of brown bears, though this is largely because the black species outnumbers the brown rather than their being more aggressive. Compared to brown bear attacks, violent encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury and death. However, the majority of black bear attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality, and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike grizzlies, female black bears do not display the same level of protectiveness to their cubs, and will seldom attack humans in their vicinity. [10]  The worst recorded fatality incident occurred in May 1978, in which a black bear killed three teenagers fishing in Algonquin Park in Canada. [11] The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become habituated to human contact and food. [10] 1028 incidences of black bears acting aggressively toward people, 107 of which resulted in injury, were recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park , and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots, where people regularly fed the bears handouts. [11]  Asian black bears [ edit ]     An Asian black bear, shot after charging the "Old Shekarry", as illustrated in Wild sports of the world: a boy's book of natural history and adventure    Though usually shy and cautious animals, Asian black bears are more aggressive toward humans than the brown bears of Eurasia. [12] According to Brigadier General R.G. Burton:   The Himalayan black bear is a savage animal, sometimes attacking without provocation, and inflicting horrible wounds, attacking generally the head and face with their claws, while using their teeth also on a prostrate victim. It is not uncommon to see men who have been terribly mutilated, some having the scalp torn from the head, and many sportsmen have been killed by these bears.  — A Book of Man Eaters , Chapter XVII Bears   E. T. Vere of Srinagar , Kashmir wrote of how his hospital received dozens of black bear victims annually. He wrote that, when attacking humans, black bears will rear up on their hind legs and knock victims over with their paws. They then make one or two bites on an arm or leg and finish with a snap to the head, this being the most dangerous part of the attack. [13] There are no records of predation on humans by Asiatic black bears in Russia [14] and no conflicts have been documented in Taiwan. [15] However, in India, attacks on humans have been increasing yearly and have occurred largely in the northwestern and western Himalayan region. In the Chamba District of Himachal Pradesh , the number of black bear attacks on humans has gradually increased from 10 in 1988–89 to 21 in 1991–92. [16]  Recent bear attacks on humans have been reported from Junbesi and Langtang National Park in Nepal, and occurred in villages as well as in the surrounding forest. [17]  Li Guoxing , the second person in history to have received a facial transplant , was a victim of a black bear attack. [18] [19] Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979–1989, [20] and more recently, in September 2009 it was reported that a black bear attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. [21] The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to be surprised by approaching humans. [10] They are also likely to attack when protecting food. [22]  Brown bears [ edit ]     Illustration of a brown bear attacking Russian hunters    As a rule, brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and will attack if they are surprised or feel threatened. [23] Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. Habituated or food conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and in some cases associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with no attacks being recorded against parties of more than seven people. [24] In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and in some cases death. [23] In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound, [10] and seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to "disarm" their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn. [25] Such a bite can be more severe than that of a tiger, and has been known to crush the heads of some human victims. [13]  Most attacks occur in the months of July, August and September, the time when the number of outdoor recreationalists, such as hikers or hunters, is higher. People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back. [10]  Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the former Soviet Union , though exceptions exist in districts where they are not pursued by hunters. [26]  East Siberian brown bears for example tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more frequently hunted European counterparts . [27] In 2008, a platinum mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 Kamchatka brown bears that killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes. [28] In Scandinavia, only three fatal attacks were recorded in the 20th century. [29] Due to increasing brown bear population in Turkey , attacks still occur in mountainous areas of Northeastern Turkey. [30]  Native American tribes whose territories overlapped with those of grizzly bears often viewed them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act was done with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4 to 10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies. [25] Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately 1 per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, though it increased to 4 per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to 1 injury every 2 years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Between 1980-2002, there were only 2 grizzly bear-caused human injuries in a developed area. However, although grizzly attacks were rare in the back-country before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately 1 per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. [31]  Polar bears [ edit ]  Polar bear attacks on humans are extremely rare, but according to records by James Wilder, there have been only 20 fatal polar bear attacks out of 73 fatal attacks between 1870 and 2014. Polar bear attacks can also happen in captivity like Binky.  Sloth bears [ edit ]  In some areas of India and Burma , sloth bears are more feared than tigers, due to their unpredictable temperament. [32] In Madhya Pradesh , sloth bear attacks accounted for the deaths of 48 people and the injuring of 686 others between the years 1989 and 1994, probably due in part to the density of population and competition for food sources. [33] One specimen, known as the sloth bear of Mysore , was single-handedly responsible for the deaths of 12 people and the mutilation of 2 dozen others before being shot by Kenneth Anderson . Sloth bears defend themselves when surprised, with the majority of confrontations occurring at night. They typically charge on all fours with their head held low, before rearing on their hind legs and striking at their attackers with their claws and teeth. [34]  Natural weapons [ edit ]  The various species of bears are well-developed for survival, both for attaining food and defending against predators, including unarmed humans. The different species all have the same general physical characteristics and senses that allow them to adapt to situations that threaten their survival.  Fur [ edit ]  A bear's fur is often very thick, and it can function much like armor. In situations between bears and other predators, such as humans, this thick fur acts with the bear's thick skin and layers of fat as a buffer against most physical attacks, sometimes buffering to some extent even against firearms. [35] According to Charles Fergus' Wild Guide: Bears , bear fur is also a source of insulation that allows bears to inhabit almost any habitat, from the hot jungles inhabited by sun bears and sloth bears to the frozen tundra inhabited by polar bears, thus occupying most of the same territory as man. [36]  Muscle [ edit ]  A bear's muscular structure is highly suited for strength and power. Polar bears are known to swim for miles in search of food and to scoop 450-pound seals out of the water. [36] An analogue to a bear for muscle for its size is a dog, an animal stronger than humans per unit of weight and never bred to sizes of an adult black bear.  Grizzly bears can bring down prey, such as bison or moose , that outweigh the bear by several hundred pounds and can steal kills from entire packs of wolves. Their top speed running on all fours has been reported to be around 40 mph (60 km/h); [37] [38] comparatively, Usain Bolt ran at a record-breaking speed of 27 mph (43 km/h) at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [39] Most people are incapable of reaching speeds even remotely close to this number; thus, it is impossible for a human to outrun a bear.  Claws [ edit ]     Claws and pawprints of an American black bear (left) and brown bear    Bears have five digits on each dextrous paw, each digit with a long non-retractable claw. The shape of the claw differs between the bear species: black bear claws are strong and curved, which allows them to claw at tree bark; grizzly bear claws are long and straight, ideal for digging, and can be up to six inches long; [40] [41] polar bear claws are thick and sharp for holding the slippery skins of seals. [40]  Jaws [ edit ]  The jaws of a bear reflect its omnivorous eating habits. A bear has forty-two teeth, with canines, which can be even longer than those of a tiger of which the lower ones are very suitable curved to ram. While a bear's canines can pierce flesh and tear meat, a bear's back teeth are relatively flat, better suited for eating plants rather than meat. However, the jaws of bears are controlled by large muscles that are capable of crushing bones, which gives access to the nutritious marrow within. [9] [42] Some grizzly bears have jaws that can bite through 6-inch-thick (150 mm) pine trees. [43]  Humans in contrast have thirty-two teeth, sixteen on each jaw, each tooth less than a half-inch long. Of these teeth, there are four incisors, two canines, four premolars, and six molars. While human incisors are capable of biting into meat, bears have more powerful jaw muscles, which make their bite more destructive to flesh. [44] More appropriate comparisons to bear dentition are to those of dogs whose teeth are similar in proportion to those of bears (and of course much smaller, although capable of inflicting much damage even at their smaller size).  Other senses and characteristics [ edit ]  Bears' senses are likely similar to those of dogs, animals that at times have much the same build and dietary habits of bears.  Bears' sense of smell is dependent on a Jacobson's organ, or vomeronasal organ , which allows the bear to easily detect airborne scents. [45] Bears use this sense of smell not only to hunt, but to detect other bears as well; male bears use smell to stay away from other male bears and to find female bears during mating season. While humans have a sense of olfaction, or smell, they do not use it for communication or for hunting; its usual range is around 10 square centimeters as compared to a polar bear that can smell a seal from twenty miles away. [45] [46]  Little is known about a bear's hearing, but scientists concluded that it is at least as good as a human's. [40] Some scientists believe that bears may even be able to detect ultrasonic sounds as well. [40]  Natural observers believe that most bear species are near-sighted, which allows bears to forage for small objects such as berries. [40] However, bears are also capable of discerning faraway movements, helping them hunt prey. [40] The Kodiak bear, when compared to other species, appears to have vision comparable to a human (not near-sighted). Experiments show that black bears can see color, unlike many mammals. [40] With scientists still working to determine exactly how perceptive bear eyes are, it is difficult to compare bear eyesight with human eyesight.  Causes of bear attacks [ edit ]  Almost all recorded bear attacks in the wild have resulted from the human surprising the bear. Hunters are the people most at risk of bear attacks because, as Tom Smith, a U.S. Geographical Survey research biologist, describes, "Hunters typically aren't making any noise, and they sleuth around while wearing camo." [47] Hunters try to be silent and, though many hunters wear reflective clothing so as not to become targets for other hunters, they try to hide their movements so as not to startle game. Most bear attacks result from hunters suddenly appearing in front of them, startling a bear into an instinctive act of aggression.  However, a bear's first reaction upon detecting a human is to run away. [2] Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from thousands of years ago when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. [2] Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. [2] Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before. [2]  Protecting young [ edit ]     Most bear attacks happen when a mother bear senses a dangerous approach to her offspring    One of the most dangerous situations that leads to bear attacks is when a bear perceives a threat to her offspring. Female bears are very defensive of their young, devoting, on their own without any participation of the male bear, many years of their lives just to raise their cubs and teach them to hunt, hence the term "mama bear" to refer to extremely reactive and protective mothers of humans, particularly those who do this without paternal care. [48] While solo bears will usually retreat, a mother bear protecting her cubs is mostly likely to attack any sudden threat. Black bears present something of an exception to this, however, as mother black bears sometimes urge their cubs to climb trees for safety instead of remaining on the ground to protect their young. [49]  Hunger [ edit ]  Another dangerous situation is when a human is faced with a hungry bear that has lost its natural fear of humans. With the decrease of hunting grounds and food crops such as berries and bark, bears often become more desperate and aggressive. [43] However, this hunger has also triggered an unexpected reaction: bears began to follow gunfire because they associate it with dead animals that they can eat. [43]  Once a bear claims an animal carcass, it becomes very protective of its kill. This becomes a problem when a bear claims a hunter's kill, as the hunter may not wish to kill the bear as well. By avoiding a bear over a carcass, the risk of attack is reduced by around fifty percent. [47]  Recovery from bear attacks [ edit ]  Aside from the large lacerations, fractures, and other wounds that can result from bear attacks, infections are also physically detrimental. A bear's mouth is full of potentially harmful bacteria, especially if the bear has been feeding on a gut pile or feces. Bear bites can result in infections common to most animal bites, including abscesses, septicemia, and even rabies. Though there is little data, what is available from bear bite statistics indicate that bears don't tend to carry many of the most well-known dangerous anaerobic bacteria strains in their normal oral flora; [50] however, given the circumstances around most bear attacks, wound contamination from the environment is highly likely and means there is risk for tetanus and other external microbial agents.  Recovery from bear attacks depends on the extent of damage, but often involves long-term medical treatment. As shown in the medical procedure led by Professor Shuzhong Guo, extreme cases of bear attacks have resulted in plastic surgeries and even facial transplants that, while successful, may take several years to complete and are sometimes fatal.

Bird feeders and unsecured pet food, garbage and grills may be bringing them to your back door.  Adapted from the book Wild Neighbors      Black bears eat mostly plants but sometimes find easy food sources in bird feeders, pet food and garbage.

Photo by iStockphoto.com     As black bear numbers increase in some North American communities and more people move into bear habitat, encounters between bears and people have risen. Whether you live in bear country or are just visiting, you can take simple steps to avoid conflicts.   Why bears lose their fear of humans  How to prevent conflicts with bears  Why hunting doesn’t solve conflicts with bears  What to do if you encounter a black bear  Bears and public health concerns  Other resources   Why bears lose their fear of humans  Bears have acute eyesight and hearing. Their sense of smell is seven times greater than a bloodhound’s. They have a keen ability to detect pet food, garbage, barbecue grills and bird feeders—and once they locate a food source, they remember where it is.  Bears are normally wary of people, but if a bear finds food without getting frightened away, he may come back for more. Each time this happens, he can become less fearful—and this habituation can lead to problems. Conflicts can heighten during hyperphagia, a feeding frenzy in late summer and fall in which bears bulk up for hibernation, gaining 3-4 pounds and consuming 20,000 calories a day.  Bears who lose their fear of people are called “nuisance bears.” These are most often subadult males—young bears who have just dispersed from their mothers and are still learning how to obtain food—and mothers with young cubs. In many states, nuisance bears are killed or trapped and moved far away in hopes that they won’t come back. But most of the time this outcome wouldn’t have been necessary if people hadn’t made food so easy to find in the yard or trash dumpster.  Animal Proof Trash Cans on Amazon.com »  How to prevent conflicts with bears  To avoid habituating the bears in your area, follow these steps.  Make trash cans inaccessible. Bring them inside at night or buy a bear-resistant trash can or an enclosure for the container.  Enclose your compost pile. Open compost piles, especially those that include kitchen scraps, are an irresistible treat in bear country. Burying compost won’t work because bears will easily find and dig it up.  Recycle wisely. If you store recyclables outside, use enclosed bins. (Persistent bears will break into even ruggedly built bins.)  Keep your barbecue grill clean and as free of drippings as possible. Move the grill away from your house when you aren’t using it, and clean it regularly with ammonia or bleach.  Rethink your bird feeders. In the summer, birds can make do with naturally available foods. If you do set up feeders, install them away from your house.  Communities experiencing bear problems can take steps such as fining people who knowingly or unknowingly feed bears, requiring bear-resistant trash cans, distributing educational flyers and training police and animal control officers in aversive conditioning techniques that use rubber bullets, fireworks and pepper spray.  Biologist Stephen Herrero: “There’s no question that it’s possible for people and bears to coexist without serious problems if we’re willing to manage our food and garbage.” Read our story on how some communities in bear country are coping »  Why hunting doesn’t solve conflicts with bears  When communities start experiencing conflicts with bears, too often state wildlife agencies institute a hunt or raise the quota of an existing hunt. But a host of studies show that hunting does nothing to resolve human-bear conflicts; hunters target bears in the woods, not the ones causing problems near human habitation.  Hunting also does not permanently reduce bear populations. Numbers actually rebound with the increased availability of food.  What to do if you encounter a black bear  If you see a black bear in your yard, don’t fear the worst. A youngster may simply be passing through in search of a home of his own. Or an adult may be checking out an enticing smell or interesting sound. Usually when he finds out there are people around, he’ll head for the hills, never to be seen again.  If you do encounter a bear, remain calm and remember that the bear is likely more scared of you than you are of him. Attacks by black bears on people are very rare and most black bears can be easily scared away with the following approach:   Stand and face the bear directly. Never run away from or approach him.  Make yourself look as big as possible by spreading your arms or, better yet, a coat.  Make as much noise as possible by yelling, banging pots and pans or using other noisemaking devices.  If the bear approaches and you have bear spray, spray the bear as he approaches.  In the very rare case that a black bear does attack you, fight back (don’t play dead).  After the bear leaves, remove whatever attracted him to the location (barbecue grill, bird feeder, pet food or garbage).   (Please note that these directions are specific for black bears; check here for information about what to do if you encounter a grizzly bear.)  Bears and public health concerns  People have little to fear in terms of catching diseases or parasites from bears. As warm-blooded animals, bears can get rabies, but it is very rare. There are no known cases of a person catching rabies from a bear.

View Images      Most bear attacks happen when people get too close to bears. Here, a photographer shoots photos of a brown bear in Alaska.    Photograph by Roy Toft, National Geographic Creative            PUBLISHED September 16, 2015     From the mountains of Maryland to the swamps of Florida to the snowy peaks of the U.S. West, bears are making a comeback.   Thanks to regulated hunting and more habitat, "there's a pretty dramatic increase in bear populations across the U.S., and people are going to be encountering bears more and more," says Dave Garshelis, bear project leader at the Minnesota Department of  Natural Resources. (Related: " Black Bears Are Rebounding—What Does That Mean For People? ")   In August, a grizzly bear killed a hiker in Yellowstone National Park—a tragic yet extremely rare event, experts say. The chances of being injured by a bear are approximately 1 in 2.1 million, according to the National Park Service . In other words, you're more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear.    Living With the Wild. As bear populations rebound across the United States, and as people increasingly move into their habitat, bear-human run-ins are inevitable. This is one of several stories asking: How do we live with the predators ?   To gain more insight into bear attacks and how to prevent them, scientists recently completed a study—not yet published—examining 675 bear attacks on people. Their research revealed distinct patterns of bear behavior that can help people stay safe in bear habitat.   “There is a lot of mythology out there about why bear attacks happen,” says Tom Smith , a biologist at Brigham Young University in Utah.   “If I wanted to make a key point, it is that the vast majority of these negative encounters are avoidable. People don’t need to go out into bear country and get hurt, nor do bears. These incidents are largely preventable, but humans have to take more responsibility.”   Here's how to be smart in bear habitat—whether it's in the deep wilderness or your own backyard.   Know your bears.   North America is home to three bear species: The black bear , brown bear (a species that includes the grizzly bear) , and polar bear .                Range of polar bear (Ursus maritimus)     Range of brown bear (Ursus arctos)     Range of American black bear (Ursus americanus)             arctic  Ocean    Greenland    canada    North  america    Pacific  Ocean    United  States    atlantic  Ocean    500 mi    mexico    500 km        NG STAFF     Find out which species live in the place where you live or plan to travel. Some places, such as Montana's Glacier National Park , are home to both grizzlies and black bears. It can be difficult to tell them apart, since black bears can also be brown, like grizzlies. However, black bears are generally smaller.  Notably, Smith says, brown bears inflicted more injuries than any other species in Alaska. The average brown bear encounter is more dangerous—3.5 times more likely to result in injury—than the average polar bear encounter, and 21 times more dangerous than the average black bear encounter, according to Smith and colleague Stephen Herrero, professor emeritus at the University of Calgary in Canada.  More than half of the attacks in the new analysis were over in less than three minutes, “consistent with the notion that the primary motivation for attacking bears is to neutralize a perceived threat, and once that is done they go on their way,” Smith says.  Don't unwittingly attract them.  Bears have a better sense of smell than dogs and love humans' food. So the main strategy to avoid run-ins is to minimize any scents or attractants on your body, campsite, or property.  "If you're a hiker, be more careful about various kind of scents and things that you would have on you," such as food, deodorant, and even chewing gum, Garshelis says.  Carry bear spray.  "The absolute best thing" to prevent a bear attack, particularly for grizzlies, is to use bear spray, a type of pepper spray, Garshelis says. (See " What Happens to Problem Bears That Go to Rehab? ")  He recommends people practice in advance how to operate the spray, including being familiar with far it shoots. (Practice outdoors and upwind; bear spray is powerful stuff.) He also says a person traveling in bear country should wear the spray on a holster in front of their bodies, so that they're not fumbling for it if they run smack into a grizzly.  In a 2008 study that also involved Smith and Herrero, scientists found that bear spray was 92 percent effective in deterring attacks from the three species of North American bear in Alaska between 1985 and 2006. Ninety-eight percent of people carrying bear spray who got into close encounters with bears were uninjured.      Travel in groups.  Being alone in the wilderness can be fulfilling, but for safety's sake it's better to walk in a group of three people or more, he says. A bear is more likely to retreat if it sees or smells several people walking toward it than if a single person approaches. (See "Why Are Black Bear Attacks Up in Florida? ")  "For the most part, they want to avoid us," he says.  Of the people injured by bears in Yellowstone National Park since 1970, 91 percent were hiking alone or with one other person .  If dogs are allowed in the area where you'll be, it's generally a good idea to bring them, since the canines often scare away bears. However, this approach can backfire: If a dog is ahead of its owner and then runs into a bear, the bear may chase it, which is not only dangerous to the dog but could endanger humans if the dog runs back to its owner.  Be alert for signs of bears.  If you see fresh scat, for instance, a bear has recently passed by. "It's a good idea to be very alert. Think through, 'How am I going to react?'"  Don't let yourself fall into a daze, either—stay present and look around as you walk.  If you're attacked or pursued, react according to the species of bear.  "Typically if you're in a place where there's just black bears, you would be bold and aggressive to a bear that approaches you," says Garshelis. Throwing things, standing tall, and yelling will drive away most black bears—although that strategy isn't foolproof.  "I've seen pretty scary videos where black bears have actually attacked people when they're doing everything right," he says. "Nothing's 100 percent." (Related: " What Do You Do With a Bear That Kills a Person ?")  If you run into a grizzly, your approach should be the opposite: Backing away slowly and getting away from the situation without provoking the animal, he says.  That's especially true with female grizzly bears with cubs, which can be particularly dangerous. (See " Video of Yellowstone Bear Chasing Tourists Isn't What You Think .")  When threatened, female grizzlies will often stand up, slap the ground, and make blowing sounds. However, "that means it's nervous; it's not aggressive," he says.  In Smith and Herrero's analysis of 675 bear attacks in Alaska, the vast majority of incidents in which bears charged occurred when people and bears confronted each other at close range, within ten yards (nine meters) or less.  In more than 50 percent of those situations, the person was not physically hurt. Of the 313 cases in which the bears injured the person, 36 percent of injuries were to legs and feet, 18 percent to the back, 18 percent to arms, and 9 percent to head and neck.  Never run.  "You can't outrun a bear," Garshelis says. "The best thing to do is walk away slowly from a bear if it already clearly sees you."  Keep watching the animal as you walk away, and some experts suggest speaking out loud in a calm voice.          WATCH: A bear can go from disinterested to dangerous in an instant. Do you know what to do if you're attacked by a startled grizzly?       Know when to play dead.  Only play dead after a bear has made contact with you.   If it's a black bear, try to fight back. If that strategy doesn't work, lay on your stomach (protecting your vital organs), clasp your hands on the back of your neck, and pull up your knees. At this point, the bear may give up and leave.  If it's a grizzly, do not try to defend yourself. "Once it's on you, and there's nothing else you can do, collapse and play dead," Garshelis says.  Since 1970, Yellowstone National Park has tracked bear encounters and found that those who play dead when attacked by a bear during a surprise encounter only got minor injuries 75 percent of the time . Those who fought back, on the other hand, suffered severe injuries 80 percent of the time.  The analysis by Smith and Herrero also revealed that things don't always end well for the bear: In 600 physical run-ins with people, bears died 34 percent of the time from injury incurred during the incident or from subsequent management actions.  Be tolerant and put things in perspective.  "Tolerance goes a long way to living with wildlife," Garshelis says.  For instance, if you're a homeowner and like to put out birdseed, consider doing it in the winter, when birds really need it and when bears are hibernating—otherwise you could have an unwelcome visitor.  Also remember that bear encounters can be enjoyable, as long as you keep your distance. (See National Geographic's best bear pictures .)  "If I'm hiking and see a bear the first thing I would do is get my camera," he says. "It's usually a really nice and rather rare experience."  Follow Christine Dell'Amore on Twitter and Google+ .

Author:  Craig Medred    Updated: July 6, 2016   Published July 28, 2010             Share on Facebook   Share on Twitter   Share via Email   Share on Tumblr   Share on Reddit   Share on LinkedIn   Share on Google Plus       Print article                      The bears are out in Alaska. No surprise. It's summer.    Encounters between people and bears are in the news. No surprise. It's summer.    Misinformation is spreading around the state like wildlife. No surprise. It's summer.    The bears are supposed to be trying to kill us, right?    "Kake resident Brandon Berkley, 17, is lucky to be alive after an encounter with a black bear sow Monday morning in Kake," reports the Juneau Empire.             Really?    But don't most encounters with black bears end with the bear running off and no one hurt? Well, yes. No doubt there are people reading this right now who've met black bears and had that happen. Black bears are actually quite timid creatures whether one meets them in Alaska or any of the many other states where they are now common.    OK, Berkley did have more than an "encounter." If his story is to be believed, he was knocked cold by a black bear. There are no witnesses.    But if he was knocked cold and the bear left him unharmed after knocking him out, as has been reported, that wouldn't be out of line with what happens in most bear attacks either.             Most people attacked by bears -- including the person writing this -- survive.    According to data compiled by the Wildlife Research Institute, people are 45 times more likely to be killed by a dog than by a bear, 120 times more likely to be killed by bees than a bear, and a whopping 250 times more likely to be killed by lightening than a bear.    Yes, Berkley is lucky to be alive, but only because everyone in the U.S. is lucky to be alive. Anyone could die in a motor vehicle accident later today because scooting around in cars is the most dangerous thing most people do. The odds of being hit by lightening are about 1 in 4.2 million. The odds of dying in a motor vehicle accident are about 1 in 20,000, and the calculated lifetime odds of death from driving can drop to near 1 in 100 if you drive a lot and for a long time.    Put down the cell phone. Put both hands on the wheel. Quit worrying about the bears. Pay attention. And drive defensively.    There is a 165 times greater chance a car will kill you than a firearm will, or some of those "dangerous" things about which the authorities keep warning people. The chances of being killed by exploding fireworks? One in 39 million.    And yet, you're still more likely to be killed by fireworks than attacked by a black bear sow with a cub like Dane Havard wasn't this week in Anchorage.    "What you don't see on the video, because of where the camera was shooting from, was the sow charging at the man who tried to free the cub, but she did not attack him," reported local TV station KTUU.             Surprise, surprise, surprise. Of course "she did not attack him."    Black bear sows -- unlike grizzly bear sows -- rarely attack. Bear researchers regularly take cubs away from black bear sows to study them (they give them back) without much of a problem. Havard was in a similar situation. He was trying to free a cub caught in a dipnet . He couldn't, but the sow eventually ripped the net apart and freed the cub.    She also huffed and puffed and tried to threaten Havard, which is what sow black bears do. Sow grizzlies, on the other hand, don't threaten; they attack. That's why it's a good idea to know how to tell the difference between block-headed grizzly bears and pinched-faced black bears if you're living in or visiting in Alaska where you might, as the Anchorage Daily News reported this week, meet a whole family of bears.    "A brown bear cub rescued after a boar attacked its family near King Cove has arrived at the Alaska Zoo," the newspaper said.    "Attacked its family...." Almost makes the bears sound cute and cuddly, doesn't it?    They're not. They're no more cute and cuddly than they are unusually dangerous. They're wildlife. They live by their own rules. One of the rules for sow grizzlies (often called brown bears in Alaska though there are cinnamon-colored black bears that also look brown) is that they try to protect their cubs from "boars," as in boar grizzlies, because bears don't really have families as people know families.    Male bears are solitary critters. They show up around other bears only to feed or breed. If they run into other bears in other circumstances, they will likely as not try to kill them. Some have theorized that grizzly boars try to kill grizzly cubs to bring grizzly sows into estrus so they can breed them again.    Fortunately, the bears can tell the difference between other bears and people, and tend to avoid even approaching the latter because people have a nasty habit of putting bullets in bears. But only in the summer At least in most of Alaska.    In the winter, the black and grizzly bears are safely tucked away in hibernation, and there are no problems. But the polar bears...    Ah, the polar bears.     Contact Craig Medred at craig(at)alaskadispatch.com .                About this Author         Craig Medred                    Local news matters.

This is a place to ask questions and post comments from my website at www.bucktrack.com                                                                                           Friday, February 04, 2011      Bears: Should you be afraid?        (Grizzly rushes towards me in Alone Across Alaska .)  What are your odds of being killed by a bear? Incredibly low. So low  that it's not something to worry about. What are the facts backing up  that statement? Since interest, or perhaps morbid obsession, with fatal  bear attacks is so high, Wikipedia actually gives a reasonably good idea of the recent numbers because people rush to list "another bear attack." According to Wikipedia, in the 2000's black bears killed 15 people in  NORTH AMERICA (including Canada, the U.S., and Mexico.) Grizzlies killed  12 people during that same period, for a total of 27. For the 90's  Wikipedia lists 23 fatal attacks. Dr. Stephen Herrero, a leading  authority on human/bear conflicts, says 29 people were killed by bears  in North America in the 1990s. In other words, less than three people  are killed in North America by bears each year over the last 20 years. And that includes all the countless people in all of the most theoretically dangerous places: Yellowstone, Denali, BC, Alberta, the Yukon, Glacier.  To put things in perspective, about 2 3/4 MILLION people die each year of all causes in the U.S. and Canada .   That's well over 7,000 people every day. Other causes are about ONE  MILLION TIMES more likely to kill you than bears. So why are people  scared of bears? Partly because every fatal bear attack gets huge news  coverage. Partly because people are instinctively afraid of bears and  the unknown and the unfamiliar. This article helps explain our bear fear (thanks to SouthMark on Whiteblaze.net.)   Death Rates in the U.S . (note, these are all from recent years, mostly from 2007)   Heart disease: 616,067  Cancer: 562,875  Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 135,952  Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 127,924  Accidents (unintentional injuries): 123,706  Alzheimer's disease: 74,632  Diabetes: 71,382  Influenza and Pneumonia: 52,717  Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 46,448  Motor Vehicle Accidents : 40,000  Septicemia: 34,828  Suicide : 30,000  Poisoning : 22,700  Falls : 21,600  Murder : 16,929  Drowning : 4,000  Boating: 339  Horseback riding : 200  Hypothermia : 187  Lightning : 90  Bee sting : 55  Dogs : 30  Snake bite : 5  Bear attack (average over 20 years in the U.S): 1.3  With about 16,929 murders a year in the US and Canada combined out of a total population of about 334,000,000, about 1 out of 19,625 people will be a murderer in a given year.  With about 3 fatal bear attacks per year in the US and Canada combined, and about 660,000 bears in the US and Canada total, about 1 out of 220,000 bears will be "murderers" in a given year.  In Stephen Herrero's great book Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance (revised edition) he says this: Bear  attacks are rare events. I told her that in North America there are an  estimated six hundred thousand black bears and sixty thousand grizzly  bears. Each year there are millions of times in which each species is  close to people and no threat or injury results... I hate to see  people's lives crippled by fear based on ignorance.  So what should you do with this information? Follow a few simple precautions and simply enjoy your trip into bear country. Trust me, you'll be fine.

I'm a hiker and do not fear bears. I respect them and act in a safe manner during the extremely rare times I encounter them on the trails. (Mostly in the GSMNP in NC and in Mt. Mitchell State Park in NC.) I have heard MANY bears run FROM me in the GSMNP. How did I know it was bears? Because no other animals make that distinctive "bear groan", I guess you would describe it. I even unknowingly walked up pretty close to a sow with cubs in GSMNP and wasn't threatened and am obviously not dead at the current time. Hopefully this article will calm the really absurd fears of some people and / or the family members of people who go into the forests. All I've heard since the announcement of my plans to do a through hike of the GSMNP in March 2011 is "Take some bear spray." LOL.. I have no intention of peeing away around 60 bucks and carrying another pound of weight for such a useless can of junk. Reply Delete Buck 9:18 AM Hi Eddie, Thanks for the comment! I hope some real world facts will help calm your family. You are right, respecting bears is smart, fearing them is unnecessary. There is no need to carry bear spray on the Appalachian Trail, that's for sure. One place I can think of that I might carry bear spray is on some of the roadside fishing streams in Alaska where habituated brown bears hang out trying to get fish parts from nearby salmon fisherman. So far, though, I've never bought a can of bear spray. Buck Reply Delete George 12:17 PM This is more info to help me get my wife to backpack with me. She a huge bearfobic. Darn TV. Thanx Reply Delete Anonymous 11:59 PM Doesn't this require a more detailed statistical analysis? How about comparing the number of human-bear encounters that result in death compared to the number of human-human encounters that do?     With 334 million people in the US and Canada, there has to a couple billion human-human encounters every day.   How many human-bear encounters per day  - statiscally you can round that to none. What is the North American bee population compared to bears? Reply Delete Buck 5:59 AM Hi Anonymous, I think the "murder rate" for humans vs. bears addresses the basic point you are trying to make. On an individual basis, a random human is over 10 times more likely than a bear to kill a person on a given year. As Dr. Herrero says, there are millions of human/bear encounters per year, most of which people are unaware. If you can round those millions of encounters to zero, it seems like with 3 fatalities per year for 334,000,000 people, it would be fair to round that number to zero, also. Even when encountering a bear, the odds of it killing you are about one out of a million. (3 fatalities/millions of encounters.) Reply Delete Zoya, Patrick, Nora and Stuart 9:12 AM I live and hunt on Kodiak, and bearanoia has always been a pet peeve of mine - I even wrote a blog post about it one time.  I checked into the numbers here on Kodiak and I believe that more people have been murdered by their hunting partner than killed by bears (I think 2 people have been killed by bears in the last 100 years).  I only carry a rifle when hunting, and I'm not sure I'd use it on a charging bear.  I've been charged a few times and they all stopped.  Now if I'd shot at them would they have stopped?  I do not think it is a coincidence that all the people who have been mauled or killed were carrying firearms.  Patrick Reply Delete Zoya, Patrick, Nora and Stuart 9:27 AM Buck,  Great Post!  And if you want to read my blog post about bearanoia - it was my entry from July 19, 2008 (I could hot link it here, but I'm always leery of that sort of thing in comments I get from strangers - so I assume you are too!).  I titled it 'bearanoia will destroy you'.  Also pepper spray is VERY effective. I once used it on a bear and It worked.  Patrick Reply Delete Buck 9:42 AM Hi Patrick, Thanks for your posts. Very interesting points you made. People reading what you said should note that you live on Kodiak Island, land of the largest bears in the world. Here is a link to your blog post, which is well worth reading. Thanks again! Buck Reply Delete Zoya, Patrick, Nora and Stuart 5:09 PM Buck I saw the uproar your post caused on the AK hunting forum. You got the same reaction I usually get here on Kodiak when I make the same point. But the stats are true - even if you limit it to just hunters in the field here on Kodiak - far more people drown, die of hypothermia, fall off of cliffs, get shot by a hunting buddy etc than ever get killed by bears.  And most maulings are in situations were people surprise or threaten a bear.  Bears do the swat/bite educate thing and keep on running (this according to the local bear biologist). That said - I do take precautions.  For instance when hunting I never return to a kill site but carry a whole animal away after butchering - and we take 5 people when we hunt elk just so we can get it all out in one load. All that said, I did have a REALLY bad charge this Fall on Afognak when we surprised a mom and three cubs in the woods.  She charged twice and got up to about 15 feet away the second time.  But I was not worried about getting killed - I had a feeling I'd just get swatted.  And who knows what would have happened if we'd shot at the bear.  And it must be said that we only surprised the bear because we were creeping through the forest upwind looking for elk.  Not what I'd normally recommend doing when hiking in bear country. Patrick Reply Delete Replies Unknown 1:36 AM What do you do when a bear comes up to you to not be attacked? Bearaphobic here. Delete Buck 2:13 PM Firstly, I think about that even an approaching bear almost certainly isn't going to hurt me at all, it's just approaching to see what I am. When it smells me, or gets a real good look, it will run. To lessen the already low danger of an approaching bear that's spotted me, I'll usually talk loud enough in a calm voice so it can hear me, stand up on a rock or a high spot if there's one nearby, and open my jacket to make myself look bigger. Most importantly I won't run. There are over 30,000 grizzlies/brown bears in Alaska, and it's been YEARS since the last fatality. Carrying bear spray is probably a good idea to ease your worries. Have fun! Buck Delete Reply Buck 6:03 PM Good points, Patrick. It's important not to surprise bears at close range. That's probably what I'm most cautious about. Getting the game kill out all at once is also wise. In Wyoming once were on horseback heading back to an elk kill and came around a corner to find a grizz and her cubs heading towards our horses. That made my heart pound. But I can honestly say I was more afraid of what the horses were going to do than what the bears were going to do! Luckily those horses had nerves of steel. The grizzlies immediately turned and fled. One thing that skews people's perception somewhat, I think, is that when people shoot a bear that seems threatening it's human nature for people to assume that if the bear hadn't been killed it would have resulted in a mauling, or worse. Maybe it would have, but most likely it wouldn't have. That's something that will always be the decision of the individual, though, and it's certainly not my place to second guess individual cases if I wasn't there. I certainly believe it is someone's right to defend their own life if necessary. Reply Delete Anonymous 4:55 AM Thanks, I liked the article.  But, you do make an error in the probabilities.  You are using rates per all people for all possible risks.  The reality is the denominator has to change to be only those involved in the activity.  Comparing all the causes of death is apples-to-oranges the way you do it. For example, to accurately show the probability of dying in a car accident, you should exclude the population who don't ever ride in a car. For bear deaths, the proper rate would be to exclude all people who never venture into bear territory.  When I am venturing out on a hike, what is relevant to me is the odds of getting attacked among people who go out for hikes, not among the general population which includes millions who never go outside. Looking at it this way would probably increase your probability of a bear attack by maybe even 100 times. Still -- the odds are really small.  And, it seems to me that those that do get attacked usually do something really stupid to provoke it.  As long as you are careful about your food and give them their space, there is very little risk. Seems like the reality is that a handful of people a year will be killed by bears, and almost every one of them would have done something really stupid to provoke the attack. You are more at risk driving to the trail than hiking! Reply Delete Buck 6:21 AM Hi Anonymous 4:55, I can see you you know something about probabilities. You are right of course, that the odds aren't equal for all people. I don't come right out and say that, but I allude to it by phrases like "all the people in all of the most dangerous places." Like many sets of stats the "user" has to apply them sensibly to their own real-world situation. I was debating the general issue with a grizzly bear hunting guide on another forum, and I pointed out that even for a grizzly guide, perhaps the people at highest risk of being attacked by a bear, easily thousands of times greater than the average American, the risk of dying by bear are STILL relatively low: for every grizzly guide killed or injured by bears there will be hundreds killed or seriously injured on the road, flying, in avalanches, drowning, by a poor diet etc. As you pointed out, 100 times near zero is still near zero. Follow the precautions in the link in the original post, and it doesn't pay to worry about bears. Reply Delete HMG7 3:56 AM Hey Buck! Here's a story for you--- I'd given myself a 5-day AT hike excursion for my  birthday, from Wallingford to S. Pomfret, Vermont, but was stopped short just after I'd reached the Cooper Shelter near the summit of Killington. Here's what happened: Having arrived at 3pm after a 9.9 mile hike from the Clarendon shelter, my feet were achy. I rested awhile but then couldn't resist that 2/10th of a mile (straight up!) on the off-trail that goes up to the summit for that gorgeous 360 view of the Green Mountains. Well----I get 100 feet from my goal, my 18-pound pack on my back, and a 4-pound fanny pack around my waist carrying all survival essentials, and decide I  want to enjoy the last 100 feet without that extra 18 pounds. Against that "inner small voice of better judgement", I drop the big pack on the rocky climb just to have the freedom of scurrying up those last feet to enjoy the summit. "I'll just be five minutes, it'll be okay."  Well, I revel in the view and then start exploring a bit into the woodsy areas, only to find one pile of bear scat after another. "Oh, sh---!" I scurry back down the rocks and of course, the pack is gone, nowhere in site,  99% certain there were no hikers anywhere near that would have taken it. I was alone at the top. So my theory---Yogi Bear was on the scent trail of the gorp in my big pack, gave a big YAHOO! when Ms. Backpacker dropped the pot o' gold and then dragged it off. There went my Thermarest, sleeping bag, extra socks (and cute new lightweight hoodie my guy had bought me for my birthday for the trip!)---and his iPhone battery charger along with some other minor stuff. Arg! So anyone out there in blog-land heading toward the Cooper Shelter, who's also planning on checking out the off-trail to the summit, would you be on the lookout for a red pack? I'd love to get that cute hoodie back!!    ; )  *grin. Reply to this blog . . . Anyway--- I'm just glad my guy had Google Earth to spot me and tell me via my iPhone that I was 500 feet from the grassy ski slope and then another 1000 ft from a Killington access road! He'd met me 35 min. later with two tacos, sympathetic eyes, and tons of bear jokes to get me laughing again. Now that's a story for the grandchildren one day! Love and happy trekking to you, Buck, all you AT hikers out there . . . Reply Delete Buck 6:20 AM Thanks for the story HMG7. There's always something new to learn, isn't there? Bears will definitely steal food if they think they can get away with it. Reply Delete Waldo4me 2:24 PM I, too, know a bit about statistics.  The problem with the various statements made is that no one is able to clearly identify and quantify the set.  As anonymous pointed out, these "statistics" are essentially invalid.  Based on everything I have read, the real answer is "we don't know".  Of course, it's much more sensational (or comforting) to throw around some big numbers.  Today's (7/12/11) edition of the the Cody Enterprise quotes Kerry Gunther saying that your chances of being killed by a grizzly are 1 in 3 million.  That's just statistical nonsense. I live in grizzly habitat and encounter them quite often.  So far, no problems and I'd estimate I've been close to about 40.  According to Kerry I have 2,999,960 to go! All in all, a good article and I agree with the basic premise.  But, telling the truth would be a better idea. Reply Delete Buck 3:29 PM Waldo4me, All in all, a good article and I agree with the basic premise. But, telling the truth would be a better idea. Your statement seems contradictory. What exactly is the truth? It seems to me that we can either evaluate risk by our general impressions based on what we've heard or what we've experienced or how we feel, or we can attempt to quantify the risk with some real world numbers. That's what I've attempted to do. People often argue against statistics when they don't like what the numbers show. I am amazed at how resistant people are to applying numbers to the risk from bears. Take this quote: "If  he is a smoker,  the odds for  a 50-year-old man [dying of cancer] more than quadruple, to 21 out of 1,000. " Now I could argue that it's a misleading stat that doesn't apply directly to an individual. Some people are more genetically inclined to get cancer, some may live in heavy radon areas, etc. However, the gist of the statistic is that smoking is relatively dangerous. You can parse it out any way you want and focus on one tree and ignore the forest, or you can see my stats for what they are, a rough way to illustrate that the risk from bears is relatively low. About one out of 100 MILLION people die from bear attack on this continent in an average year. You might think that that statistic is meaningless. I don't. Reply Delete Waldo4me 7:50 PM Take this quote: "If he is a smoker, the odds for a 50-year-old man [dying of cancer] more than quadruple, to 21 out of 1,000." That's exactly the point.  Your risk of lung cancer is elevated if you smoke.  If you go through life not smoking the statistic doesn't apply. Now, I've lived within an hour or so of YNP all my life and I've hiked thousands of miles through the park.  On any given day there are thousands of people at Fishing Bridge, Old Faithful et al and, there is hardly anyone on the back country trails.  Since guessing seems to be OK, I'll guess more than 95% of the people who visit YNP never leave the asphalt road or a developed attraction.  What do you think? So, let's suppose of the 3 million annual visitors, maybe 150,000 get into the backcountry.  You might think that would be 150,000 to 1 odds.  It's not.  The interactions are measured factorially not arithmetically.  I'd say it would be in the neighborhood of 30,000 to 1.  To measure the chances of a bear encounter or fatality based on the total number of visitors to the park is invalid, unreasonable and simply not true.  You can take all the potshots at me you want but it won't change the math. Once again, I'm on your side.  The chances of a bear encounter are very slim.  It just seems to me that we'd all be better served by presenting facts not made up statistics. I'm done.  You can have the last word. Reply Delete Buck 10:09 PM Waldo, the sources of my stats are cited. My point about smoking is perfectly valid. If you smoke your odds of dying from smoking are high. If you venture into bear country your odds of dying from bears are extremely low. If you never encounter smoke or never go into bear country stats applying to either don't apply. It doesn't make them meaningless. Using your made up statistic(!) of 150,000 backcountry visits for Yellowstone per year with one fatality in the last 25 years, that's 3,750,000 backcountry Yellowstone visits with one fatality. Of the six fatal Yellowstone bear attacks in recorded history that I can find, 2 were in the frontcountry, so your insinuation that only the backcountry visitors are at risk is incorrect. I live in grizzly bear country too and have encountered many bears, scores if not hundreds (I believe it was 17 in two days last year) here and in Yellowstone. My odds of being killed by a bear are not zero, but they are near zero. The odds absolutely vary, affected by innumerable factors that are impossible to nail down accurately. In a case like that common sense tells me to step back and take a look at the big picture. To me the big picture says that I should be aware of bears but don't worry about them even though I'm subject to a dramatically higher risk than the average American. The degree of stress and worry that people expend towards bears is unwarranted by the facts. Reply Delete Anonymous 1:54 PM As was mentioned early on, you have a much better chance of being killed by another human. Statistically, according to the last figures I saw a few years ago, merely displaying a firearm is sufficient to cause over 80 percent of aggressive humans to back off, even if an assault is in progress. It's still a more or less free country so take whatever chances you like. My choice is to go armed. Reply Delete Anonymous 11:52 AM I love hiking, but am a bear-aphobe to the point where it does cripple me. Black bears don't bother me, it's the grizz that really really scare me. They seem to be agressive, and will protect cubs. I understand my phobia is irrational, but it is real and would love to overcome it. Everything in this article is true and there is nothing I can do to convince myself. I will wear bells, hike in groups, even carry bear spray, but still it doesn't ease the pain. Please someone out there, do you have any suggestions for lowering the phobia? Reply Delete Buck 3:34 PM Anonymous, First of all thanks for being rational about the actual odds! Nearly all of us have an irrational level of fear for certain things. One thing I know that helps many people for their bear fear is more exposure time. Many people on the Appalachian Trail, for example, are afraid to go to sleep the first few nights and barely even think about bears a few weeks later. Maybe someone else has more suggestions? Reply Delete TimothyD11 3:00 PM I finally got out to Glacier National Park and did some hiking and I was concerned about the grizzlies - we just made lots of noise and hoped for the best! I would like to do backpacking trips in Glacier NP and beyond but grizzlies do have me a little worried / concerned. I guess the key is to go in large groups and make a lot of noise and have your bear spray ready to go in a second. Then you think of those rare occasions a bear decides to drag you out of your tent at night and make you dinner. I guess people worry not because of the likelihood of something happening - it is highly unlikely - but because of how absolutely terrifying the thought of it happening - I mean, I could think of a thousand ways I'd rather go that being shredded and eaten by a grizzly bear. Reply Delete Replies Buck 5:03 PM I just spent over 2 months by myself in the most brown bear dense area of North America, Admiralty Island. http://bucktrack.com/Alaska_Survival_Journal.html I have spent about 34 years in Alaska. I don't know anyone dragged out of their tent and killed, I don't know anyone killed by a bear in any fashion. That's how rare it is. You're right though, TimothyD11, people are scared of the thought of it happening. It's so rare worrying about it actually happening is a waste of time. Basic precautions and enjoying your trip is the way to go! Delete Reply Navatha K 10:26 AM This comment has been removed by a blog administrator. Reply Delete Anonymous 10:40 PM "We don't know" is indeed accurate, more data must be collected. More bears studied and more research done on how they behave, which seem by all accounts of folks "petting and befriending" then that they are rather loveable big bears who fear humans. And humans are fucking dangerous. Guns and cars consistently kills bears, so they learn from that humans are dangerous to them. More bear research is needed to first say We don't fully know enough. And instead of media hyperbolic fear mongering maybe the media can honestly admit "we don't know" pfff media likes to "make story" usually for money/profit... The fear of bears is exactly like "fear of satan".... That which people don't understand they fear/demonize. I accept my satanic inner bear. Fun concept/idea would be the apex predator realizing that we are the ones to be afraid of. Both our friends, relatives, and ourselves in the powers of action of all of our deity. If only we could respect the great bear and respect each other. Bah humbug! Humans would rather fear and worship an invisible God than love each other. In the words of ultron "humans are so doomed" .... May the beareth rise forth as the kind beast it is and expose violent humanity for the ugly beast it is... Reply Delete Unknown 8:41 PM Hey i've been thinking about becoming a forestry technician in Canada but lately have been unnerved by the idea of getting mirked by a cougar and a bear. I'm from the sub urbs and don't like the city and want something totally different for my adult life, do you guys have any advice for someone with this irrational fear? Reply Delete Replies Buck 11:50 AM I think experience is one of the best teachers. Many Appalachian Trail hikers are afraid of bears the first days and later in their hike barely think about them. So get out there!  Carrying bear spray will help build your confidence as well. Buck Delete Reply Jim Thode 8:21 PM This thread is quite old, can I still post? Reply Delete Replies Buck 4:37 AM Absolutely! Delete Jim Thode 6:35 PM Thanks Buck.  I agree with one of the previous comments on your risk assessment.  Normal life hazards are too far removed from hazards from grizzly bears to compare the two.  Most people are never put in a situation were a bear interaction is even remotely possible.   On the other hand it could be said with 100% accuracy that the chance of getting mauled or killed by a grizzly in wilderness type areas where grizzlies live is infinitely greater then in other wilderness areas where no grizzlies live.  Many that enjoy public access to public lands see that more bears equals less public access.   I’m thinking of mostly grizzly bears and ongoing push to widen their existing range. So, to original question, “should you be afraid of (grizzly) bears?” I say yes for a few reasons.  Grizzly bears are named Ursus arctos horribilis for good reason.  Yes, "horribilis" is the Latin root of the English "horrible."  They are much more dangerous then black bears with grizzlies reported to be over 20 times more dangerous than black bears. Any introduction of grizzlies to areas where they do not exist will limit public access and use of those areas.  Public access to grizzly habitat areas is commonly restricted, at least part of the year.  Common recommendations when visiting areas inhabited by grizzlies are to make noise, travel only in groups and don’t travel at night.  Making noise and traveling in groups is contrary to the very purpose of wilderness areas.  The 1964 Wilderness Act declares that wilderness must provide outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.  Many visitors to wilderness areas do so for the solitude and it is not a large step from a recommendation to travel in groups to a requirement that you must travel in groups.  If you have to go in a group to stay safe from the “horrible” bears, you just as well stay in the city. In photography traveling during periods of darkness is often required and very rewarding. Traveling in the darkness is often required for sunsets, sunrises and night sky photos. Yes, you should be very afraid of at least grizzly bears. Delete Buck 7:48 AM Hi Jim, Any two risks can be compared, that is why people can compare the risks of an asteroid impact to the risks of a heart attack. I've lived in Alaska, in grizzly bear country, for decades. For me, and for hundreds of thousands of other people, the risk from grizzlies is "normal." I've had friends die in falls, drowning, airplane crashes, car accidents, in wildfires: many different ways. None from grizzly bear attack. Should I be "very afraid" of flying? Because it's something I spend far less time doing and yet is far more likely to kill me than grizzly bears. A healthy respect for bears is rational and sensible. The vastly inflated level of bear fear many people have is irrational and unhealthy. I agree that any policy of widely expanding the current grizzly bear range should be carefully considered because it is certain to cause increased conflicts of many kinds. Buck Delete Jim Thode 9:26 AM We pretty much agree.  I lived, worked, hiked, hunted and fished in Alaskan grizzly habitat for years and really did not have a lot of concern about them. The restriction of public access to public lands is the largest issue for me. Jim Delete Reply Nicholas S 5:32 AM Buck, thanks for the numbers and for sharing your extensive experience with all of us. I wanted to address Mr. Thode's fear of grizzlies compared to black bears. I invite him and anyone else to inspect Wikipedia's page pertaining to bear fatalities in North America. One can see that black bears are nothing to be fearless or careless around. And statistically, black bears are more likely to be predatory than grizzlies. Bear spray for any territory is what I say! That can also blind aggressive humans if need be. And I carry a gun as well for just-in-case situations. Nick Reply Delete Replies Buck 6:22 AM The problem with only looking at the worst case scenarios (Wikipedia Bear Fatalities) is that it doesn't give a realistic idea of odds. Its numerators without denominators. Accidental gun deaths are orders of magnitude more common than deaths from bears. I think it's fair to say that the risk of mitigation attempts (millions more cans of bear spray and guns being carried) far exceed the risk from bears in most scenarios. Of course, it's a free country! Delete Reply Add comment Load more...

Play dead? Fight back? Climb a tree? Science has the answer    By Rose Eveleth    smithsonian.com   June 20, 2013          Image: Brad Wilke     In Canada, bear mischief has been on the rise for the past few weeks. The Globe and Mail spoke with bear-attack expert Stephern Herrero about it and within his Q&A one thing in particular stuck out: if you play dead during a bear attack, you’re pretty certain to be dead by the end of it. Here’s what he said :   The most tragic one is people playing dead during a predacious attack. Because in that circumstance, the bear just keeps on chewing.   This might surprise you, because a lot of places include “playing dead” as part of their bear attack advice. PBS says you should . ”If the animal makes contact, curl up into a ball on your side, or lie flat on your stomach,” they write. “Try not to panic; remain as quiet as possible until the attack ends.” Mountain Nature says “playing dead in a daytime grizzly encounter tends to reduce the level of injury sustained by most attack victims.” Another advice site says that “even if the bear bites you continue to play dead. Once he realizes that you are not a threat he may leave.”  This is an old idea. In 1806, an explorer wrote of a Native American woman who, when attacked by a bear, dropped to the ground and was still. The bear ran off to attack her husband. Another California pioneer wrote “if the man lies still, with his face down, the bear will usually content himself with biting… for a while about the arms and legs, and will then go off a few steps and watch… the bear will believe him dead, and will soon… go away. But let the man move, and the bear is upon him again; let him fight, and he will be in imminent danger of being torn to pieces.”  But what does the science say about this? Well, the key to understanding Herrero’s advice there is understanding the word “predacious.” Predacious attacks are those in which the bear is actually hunting you, rather than responding defensively. A mother bear defending her cubs is not hunting you, she’s just trying to make you go away.  So if the bear attacking you is in defense mode, playing dead is probably the right thing to do. One study on bear attacks writes that “the bear may swat at or bite the victim, but the if victim can retain the presence of mind to lay still, it is likely that he or she will survive the attack.” A look at the bear attacks in Yellowstone National Park between 1931 and 1984 found that 80 percent of the hikers that fought back against the bears were injured.  Hererro’s own book suggests playing dead during “sudden encounters,” when you and the bear surprise one another and the bear attacks in defense.  But what if the bear is attacking you for real? What should you do then? Pretty much all scientific advice guides agree that if the bear sees you as food, you should fight. “The victim should always fight back in the event of a clear predatory attack, such as being pulled out of a tent, regardless of species,” one study says . Another strategy that Herrero’s book says might work is dropping something as a diversion, like a camera, to distract the bear while you escape.  While we’re on the topic of bears, it turns out that some of the other bear survival tips are also misguided. Many places say to climb a tree, which is often a bad idea since many bears can probably climb that tree faster than you can. Don’t run away either, since bears can run through a forest far faster than you can too. The Yellowstone study says that of all the hikers attacked, 61 percent hikers who were injured tried to run away or climb trees.  In the end, your odds against a 1,500-pound brown bear aren’t great. They’re bigger, stronger and faster than you, and have likely killed far more living beings than you have. The key to not being chewed on alive, slashed to death, or otherwise mauled is to know what kind of situation you’re in and respond calmly and appropriately. A tough task when you’re under attack by a bear.

Mountain  Which Wild Animal is Statistically Most Likely to Attack You?      like       tweet           Tuesday March 22, 2016                Casey Butler   Writer/Surfer  Community           Photo: Matt Draper         You’re on dawn patrol, solo, and the surface of the sea is like glass. Between sets, your feet disappear in the murky water. Suddenly you have that sinking feeling that something down there is watching. But you know that the odds are small, that Jaws effectively vilified the ocean’s most deadly predator and that’s the only reason you’re even considering the possibility of a shark attacking, that the very idea is asinine. That water, though. Come to think of it, didn’t Jaws take place somewhere around here? And how small are the odds, really ?  Sharks take up with wolves, snakes, mountain lions and bears in that part of our brains reserved for worst-case scenarios. In actuality, we’re more likely to be killed by cows than any of them. (Yes, really.)  Gordon Grice, author of The Book of Deadly Animals , says that he thinks our fears of large, toothy creatures are hardwired.  “I’ve seen research showing that humans are better able to spot the shape of a snake in a drawing than other shapes,” he explains. “We are programmed to see that specific shape. People who are good at spotting it have an evolutionary advantage over those who aren’t, because snakebite has historically been a major cause of mortality for humans. (It still is in parts of Asia and Africa.)” Advertisement  “I haven’t seen similar research regarding big mammalian predators, but I believe our response to them is similar,” he continues. “At the same time, we tend not to fear other stimuli even if they’re proven dangerous. [The car] scares almost nobody but kills more Americans than all non-human animals combined. The response that helped hunter-gatherers survive a millennia ago still prevails; more logical responses haven’t had time to get coded into our genes.”  But if you were going to go out in a blaze of beastly glory, which animal would be the most likely to usher in your demise?  Studies have estimated that there are about two million surfers in the U.S. and roughly 20 million of us worldwide. According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), a comprehensive global database of shark encounters, there were 59 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks in the U.S. last year – none of which were fatal.  “Surfers and others participating in board sports were most often (49 percent of cases) involved in 2015 incidents,” reports ISAF. My fairly slapdash (at best) calculations indicate that surfers in the U.S. have about a one in 69,180 chance of being attacked by a shark. George Burgess, Director of the Florida Program for Shark Research and Curator of ISAF, explains why my numbers are off:  “[The] problem is that the two million surfers likely go into the water and spend more time in the water than two million of any other user group. So whatever odds you calculate based solely on surfer proportion will be skewed high because their in-the-water hours per person are so much higher. That said, the activities of surfers [are] probably more provocative than other aquatic recreationists and they [are] often in the water at the wrong times (dawn and dusk).”  All of this is to say nothing of the millions of non-surfing ocean goers. The Florida Museum of Natural History calculates that ocean swimmers have only a one in 11.5 million chance of being attacked by a shark. The odds of simply drowning in the ocean are almost three times greater. Fun fact: Last year, more people died taking selfies than at the jaws of the fearsome fish.  Photo: Taylor Case  If you are one of the 37,323,000 hikers in this country (according to the Outdoor Foundation ), you’re obviously more likely to encounter bears than people who spend zero time in the woods. Black bears are by far the most populous – and the most widespread – with an estimated population of 300,000 (or more) spread across at least 40 of our 50 states. Fortunately, they are also the smallest and most timid of the three North American bears.  World Wildlife Fund estimates that there are as many as 30,000 grizzly bears (aka brown bears) in Western Canada and Alaska, but fewer than 1,000 in other parts of the U.S. The Get Bear Smart Society says that Americans are most likely to come across black bears and grizzlies – though polar bear encounters are also possible in Alaska. There are only 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears worldwide, according to WWF.  In 2014, National Geographic reported that while there is an average of one fatal bear attack each year, the number of mauling incidents has increased, thanks to larger bear and human populations.  Still, “bear attacks are extremely rare,” Bear Smart says. “Although there are thousands of human-bear encounters every year, only a very few result in personal injury. Most bears will actually retreat before you are even aware of their presence.” So as long as you’re not dead set on a bear selfie, you’re probably good.  Hikers and backpackers may also worry about wolf, coyote, and mountain lion attacks, depending on where they’re hiking. “Coyotes and wild wolves aren’t historically much of a threat to humans in North America, but they have killed a few people each,” Grice explains.  There are fewer than 6,000 gray wolves in the lower 48 states, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and they’re concentrated in Minnesota. The coyote population, on the other hand, is booming – so much so that they’re addressed in the University of California’s Integrated Pest Management Program.  “Normally, coyotes are elusive animals that avoid contact with humans,” says the IPM site. “Most active after dusk and before daylight, they are typically seen only at a distance. … Within urban and suburban areas in California, however, some coyotes have adapted to residential neighborhoods, parks, and open spaces, and seemingly have lost their fear of humans.”  According to IPM, there have been more than 160 attacks on humans and/or pets since the ’70s, and though only one was fatal, they are becoming more frequent – especially in Southern California.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that it does not track mountain lion attacks nationally and doesn’t know of any source for national statistics, but the Mountain Lion Foundation says that there are between 20,000 and 40,000 mountain lions (also called cougars or pumas) in the U.S. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife says that there were 15 verified mountain lion attacks on humans in California between 1986 and 2014 – three were fatal. Some sources suggest a national annual average of 14 attacks with fewer than one death per year, but this is tough to verify.

There are 7,000-8,000 venomous snake bites reported annually in the U.S. but thanks to modern medicine, the chances of dying from a snake bite are only one in 50 million, according to the University of Florida’s Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation.  “The animals most likely to kill a human in the U.S. are other humans, domestic dogs, [and] stinging insects, including honey bees,” Grice concludes.  When it comes down to it, our chances of being attacked are dependent on our activity of choice, location, and frequently, our own behavior. Dedicated surfers in Florida probably will see a shark at some point and hikers in cougar country may spot a mountain lion, but here’s the thing: Heart attacks outnumber shark attacks in this country 12,457 to one.

  Bear-Inflicted Injuries & Fatalities                    Bear-Inflicted Human Injuries & Fatalities in Yellowstone        Since 1980, over 100 million people have visited Yellowstone. During this time, 38 people were injured by grizzly bears in the park. For all park visitors combined, the chances of being injured by a grizzly bear are approximately 1 in 2.7 million. The risk is significantly lower for people who don't leave developed areas or roadsides, and higher for anyone hiking in the backcountry.  Type of Recreational Activity: Risk of Grizzly Bear Attack Remain in developed areas, roadsides, and boardwalks: 1 in 25.1 million visits Camp in roadside campgrounds: 1 in 22.8 million overnight stays Camp in the backcountry: 1 in 1.4 million overnight stays Travel in the backcountry: 1 in 232,000 person travel days All park activities combined: 1 in 2.7 million visits  If you plan to hike, learn about the best practices for exploring bear country.  Injuries  Grizzly bear-inflicted injuries to humans in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, and four per year during the 1960s. Grizzly bear-caused human injuries in developed areas then decreased to one injury every two years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Since 1980, there have been only two (0.1/year) grizzly bear-caused human injuries in developed areas, an average of approximately one every 18 years. Over the same time span, there have been 34 human injuries caused by grizzly bears in the backcountry: an average of one per year.  Fatalities  Since Yellowstone was established in 1872, eight people have been killed by bears in the park. More people in the park have died from drowning, burns (after falling into hot springs), and suicide than have been killed by bears. To put it in perspective, the probability of being killed by a bear in the park (8 incidents) is only slightly higher than the probability of being killed by a falling tree (6 incidents), in an avalanche (6 incidents), or being struck and killed by lightning (5 incidents). Here is summary of each fatality:   August 2015 - a day hiker, hiking by himself, was killed by an adult female grizzly bear with two cubs near the Elephant Back Loop Trail in the Lake Village  August 2011 - a day hiker, hiking by himself, was killed by a grizzly bear on the Mary Mountain Trail in Hayden Valley.  July 2011 - a day hiker in a party of two was killed by an adult female grizzly bear with 2 cubs on the Wapiti Lake Trail in Hayden Valley.  October 1986 - a photographer was killed by an adult female grizzly bear near Otter Creek in Hayden Valley.  July 1984 - a grizzly bear killed a backpacker in a backcountry campsite located at the southern end of White Lake near Pelican Valley.  June 1972 - an old adult female grizzly bear killed a man in an illegally established camp. The man surprised the bear when he returned to his campsite at night. The bear was in his camp feeding on food that he had left out unsecured in the campsite.  August 1942 - a bear killed a woman at night in the Old Faithful campground. The species of bear involved was not determined.  1916 - a grizzly bear killed a man in a roadside camp.  A possible fatality supposedly occurred in 1907 when a man was attacked by a female grizzly bear after he prodded her cub with an umbrella. The account of the incident appeared in a popular book, "Book of a Hundred Bears" published in 1909 by F.D. Smith. However, the validity of this incident is questionable as there is no mention of it in official park reports or local newspapers from 1907. The "Book of a Hundred Bears" contains many stories without providing back-up documentation. The 1907 story appears to be an unsubstantiated legend.

View Images      Most bear attacks happen when people get too close to bears. Here, a photographer shoots photos of a brown bear in Alaska.    Photograph by Roy Toft, National Geographic Creative            PUBLISHED September 16, 2015     From the mountains of Maryland to the swamps of Florida to the snowy peaks of the U.S. West, bears are making a comeback.   Thanks to regulated hunting and more habitat, "there's a pretty dramatic increase in bear populations across the U.S., and people are going to be encountering bears more and more," says Dave Garshelis, bear project leader at the Minnesota Department of  Natural Resources. (Related: " Black Bears Are Rebounding—What Does That Mean For People? ")   In August, a grizzly bear killed a hiker in Yellowstone National Park—a tragic yet extremely rare event, experts say. The chances of being injured by a bear are approximately 1 in 2.1 million, according to the National Park Service . In other words, you're more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear.    Living With the Wild. As bear populations rebound across the United States, and as people increasingly move into their habitat, bear-human run-ins are inevitable. This is one of several stories asking: How do we live with the predators ?   To gain more insight into bear attacks and how to prevent them, scientists recently completed a study—not yet published—examining 675 bear attacks on people. Their research revealed distinct patterns of bear behavior that can help people stay safe in bear habitat.   “There is a lot of mythology out there about why bear attacks happen,” says Tom Smith , a biologist at Brigham Young University in Utah.   “If I wanted to make a key point, it is that the vast majority of these negative encounters are avoidable. People don’t need to go out into bear country and get hurt, nor do bears. These incidents are largely preventable, but humans have to take more responsibility.”   Here's how to be smart in bear habitat—whether it's in the deep wilderness or your own backyard.   Know your bears.   North America is home to three bear species: The black bear , brown bear (a species that includes the grizzly bear) , and polar bear .                Range of polar bear (Ursus maritimus)     Range of brown bear (Ursus arctos)     Range of American black bear (Ursus americanus)             arctic  Ocean    Greenland    canada    North  america    Pacific  Ocean    United  States    atlantic  Ocean    500 mi    mexico    500 km        NG STAFF     Find out which species live in the place where you live or plan to travel. Some places, such as Montana's Glacier National Park , are home to both grizzlies and black bears. It can be difficult to tell them apart, since black bears can also be brown, like grizzlies. However, black bears are generally smaller.  Notably, Smith says, brown bears inflicted more injuries than any other species in Alaska. The average brown bear encounter is more dangerous—3.5 times more likely to result in injury—than the average polar bear encounter, and 21 times more dangerous than the average black bear encounter, according to Smith and colleague Stephen Herrero, professor emeritus at the University of Calgary in Canada.  More than half of the attacks in the new analysis were over in less than three minutes, “consistent with the notion that the primary motivation for attacking bears is to neutralize a perceived threat, and once that is done they go on their way,” Smith says.  Don't unwittingly attract them.  Bears have a better sense of smell than dogs and love humans' food. So the main strategy to avoid run-ins is to minimize any scents or attractants on your body, campsite, or property.  "If you're a hiker, be more careful about various kind of scents and things that you would have on you," such as food, deodorant, and even chewing gum, Garshelis says.  Carry bear spray.  "The absolute best thing" to prevent a bear attack, particularly for grizzlies, is to use bear spray, a type of pepper spray, Garshelis says. (See " What Happens to Problem Bears That Go to Rehab? ")  He recommends people practice in advance how to operate the spray, including being familiar with far it shoots. (Practice outdoors and upwind; bear spray is powerful stuff.) He also says a person traveling in bear country should wear the spray on a holster in front of their bodies, so that they're not fumbling for it if they run smack into a grizzly.  In a 2008 study that also involved Smith and Herrero, scientists found that bear spray was 92 percent effective in deterring attacks from the three species of North American bear in Alaska between 1985 and 2006. Ninety-eight percent of people carrying bear spray who got into close encounters with bears were uninjured.      Travel in groups.  Being alone in the wilderness can be fulfilling, but for safety's sake it's better to walk in a group of three people or more, he says. A bear is more likely to retreat if it sees or smells several people walking toward it than if a single person approaches. (See "Why Are Black Bear Attacks Up in Florida? ")  "For the most part, they want to avoid us," he says.  Of the people injured by bears in Yellowstone National Park since 1970, 91 percent were hiking alone or with one other person .  If dogs are allowed in the area where you'll be, it's generally a good idea to bring them, since the canines often scare away bears. However, this approach can backfire: If a dog is ahead of its owner and then runs into a bear, the bear may chase it, which is not only dangerous to the dog but could endanger humans if the dog runs back to its owner.  Be alert for signs of bears.  If you see fresh scat, for instance, a bear has recently passed by. "It's a good idea to be very alert. Think through, 'How am I going to react?'"  Don't let yourself fall into a daze, either—stay present and look around as you walk.  If you're attacked or pursued, react according to the species of bear.  "Typically if you're in a place where there's just black bears, you would be bold and aggressive to a bear that approaches you," says Garshelis. Throwing things, standing tall, and yelling will drive away most black bears—although that strategy isn't foolproof.  "I've seen pretty scary videos where black bears have actually attacked people when they're doing everything right," he says. "Nothing's 100 percent." (Related: " What Do You Do With a Bear That Kills a Person ?")  If you run into a grizzly, your approach should be the opposite: Backing away slowly and getting away from the situation without provoking the animal, he says.  That's especially true with female grizzly bears with cubs, which can be particularly dangerous. (See " Video of Yellowstone Bear Chasing Tourists Isn't What You Think .")  When threatened, female grizzlies will often stand up, slap the ground, and make blowing sounds. However, "that means it's nervous; it's not aggressive," he says.  In Smith and Herrero's analysis of 675 bear attacks in Alaska, the vast majority of incidents in which bears charged occurred when people and bears confronted each other at close range, within ten yards (nine meters) or less.  In more than 50 percent of those situations, the person was not physically hurt. Of the 313 cases in which the bears injured the person, 36 percent of injuries were to legs and feet, 18 percent to the back, 18 percent to arms, and 9 percent to head and neck.  Never run.  "You can't outrun a bear," Garshelis says. "The best thing to do is walk away slowly from a bear if it already clearly sees you."  Keep watching the animal as you walk away, and some experts suggest speaking out loud in a calm voice.          WATCH: A bear can go from disinterested to dangerous in an instant. Do you know what to do if you're attacked by a startled grizzly?       Know when to play dead.  Only play dead after a bear has made contact with you.   If it's a black bear, try to fight back. If that strategy doesn't work, lay on your stomach (protecting your vital organs), clasp your hands on the back of your neck, and pull up your knees. At this point, the bear may give up and leave.  If it's a grizzly, do not try to defend yourself. "Once it's on you, and there's nothing else you can do, collapse and play dead," Garshelis says.  Since 1970, Yellowstone National Park has tracked bear encounters and found that those who play dead when attacked by a bear during a surprise encounter only got minor injuries 75 percent of the time . Those who fought back, on the other hand, suffered severe injuries 80 percent of the time.  The analysis by Smith and Herrero also revealed that things don't always end well for the bear: In 600 physical run-ins with people, bears died 34 percent of the time from injury incurred during the incident or from subsequent management actions.  Be tolerant and put things in perspective.  "Tolerance goes a long way to living with wildlife," Garshelis says.  For instance, if you're a homeowner and like to put out birdseed, consider doing it in the winter, when birds really need it and when bears are hibernating—otherwise you could have an unwelcome visitor.  Also remember that bear encounters can be enjoyable, as long as you keep your distance. (See National Geographic's best bear pictures .)

Bear attack   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Although rare, bear attacks can be fatal.    A bear attack is an attack by any mammal of the family Ursidae , on another animal, although it usually refers to bears attacking humans or domestic pets. Bear attacks are of particular concern for those who are in bear habitats. They can be fatal and often hikers, hunters, fisherman, and others in bear country take precautions against bear attacks.  According to Taylor Y. Cardall and Peter Rosen, in their article "Grizzly Bear Attack" published in the Journal of Emergency Medicine , there were 162 bear-inflicted injuries reported in the United States between 1900 and 1985. This constitutes approximately two reported bear-inflicted injuries per year. [1] Likewise, Stephen Herrero , a Canadian biologist, reports that during the 1990s bears killed around three people a year in the U.S. and Canada, as compared to the 15 people killed every year by dogs . [2] Multiple reports remark that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to be attacked by a bear when outdoors; around 90 people are killed by lightning each year. [3] However, with the increase in habitat destruction, interactions between bears and humans have increased and one would expect bear attacks to likewise be on the rise.

According to Wild Bears of the Worlds , by Paul Ward and Suzanne Kynaston, human contact with bears has existed since the time of the Neanderthals and the European cave bear around 200,000 to 75,000 years ago. [4] There is some evidence of cave bear worship during these early years: between the years 1917 and 1922, Emil Bachler discovered a large stone chest filled with cave bear skulls in the Drachenloch Cave, one of the Wildkirchli ; between 1916 and 1922, Konrad Hormann found narrow niches filled with five cave bear skulls. [4] However, at these sites, there have been little evidence of any human presence, and so some scientists have come to regard such discoveries as the result of some natural cause. [4]  Ward and Kynaston go on to report that Cro-Magnon humans, who first appeared nearly 35,000 years ago, show more obvious evidence of cave bear worship in the forms of paintings, sculptures, and engravings; however, there is still some doubt as to whether these works specifically depict the cave bear or the European brown bear. [5]  In the 1900s, bear populations had been decreasing because of increased hunting of bears for sustenance (done mostly by native peoples such as the Inupiat of Alaska and the Inuvialuit of Canada) and for trophy prizes. [6] Polar bear skins became popular as a sign of wealth and prestige, especially in Europe during the Victorian era. [7] Comparatively, the pelts of giant panda , were also highly valued, priced at around 176,000 U.S. dollars. [8]  More recently, laws have been instated to protect the dwindling populations of bears; however, as stated in Return of the Grizzly by David Whitman, these laws have increased the tensions between bears and humans. While this allows bear populations to recuperate, it also prevents people from killing bears that have invaded their property and killed their livestock. [9]  Species, and respective aggressiveness [ edit ]  American black bears [ edit ]     Damage done by a black bear to a car door in Yosemite Valley    Unlike grizzly bears, which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled in. Black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans, and usually limit themselves to making mock charges, emitting blowing noises and swatting the ground with their forepaws. However, according to Stephen Herrero in his Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance , 23 people were killed by black bears from 1900 to 1980. The number of black bear attacks on humans is higher than those of brown bears, though this is largely because the black species outnumbers the brown rather than their being more aggressive. Compared to brown bear attacks, violent encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury and death. However, the majority of black bear attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality, and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike grizzlies, female black bears do not display the same level of protectiveness to their cubs, and will seldom attack humans in their vicinity. [10]  The worst recorded fatality incident occurred in May 1978, in which a black bear killed three teenagers fishing in Algonquin Park in Canada. [11] The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become habituated to human contact and food. [10] 1028 incidences of black bears acting aggressively toward people, 107 of which resulted in injury, were recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park , and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots, where people regularly fed the bears handouts. [11]  Asian black bears [ edit ]     An Asian black bear, shot after charging the "Old Shekarry", as illustrated in Wild sports of the world: a boy's book of natural history and adventure    Though usually shy and cautious animals, Asian black bears are more aggressive toward humans than the brown bears of Eurasia. [12] According to Brigadier General R.G. Burton:   The Himalayan black bear is a savage animal, sometimes attacking without provocation, and inflicting horrible wounds, attacking generally the head and face with their claws, while using their teeth also on a prostrate victim. It is not uncommon to see men who have been terribly mutilated, some having the scalp torn from the head, and many sportsmen have been killed by these bears.  — A Book of Man Eaters , Chapter XVII Bears   E. T. Vere of Srinagar , Kashmir wrote of how his hospital received dozens of black bear victims annually. He wrote that, when attacking humans, black bears will rear up on their hind legs and knock victims over with their paws. They then make one or two bites on an arm or leg and finish with a snap to the head, this being the most dangerous part of the attack. [13] There are no records of predation on humans by Asiatic black bears in Russia [14] and no conflicts have been documented in Taiwan. [15] However, in India, attacks on humans have been increasing yearly and have occurred largely in the northwestern and western Himalayan region. In the Chamba District of Himachal Pradesh , the number of black bear attacks on humans has gradually increased from 10 in 1988–89 to 21 in 1991–92. [16]  Recent bear attacks on humans have been reported from Junbesi and Langtang National Park in Nepal, and occurred in villages as well as in the surrounding forest. [17]  Li Guoxing , the second person in history to have received a facial transplant , was a victim of a black bear attack. [18] [19] Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979–1989, [20] and more recently, in September 2009 it was reported that a black bear attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. [21] The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to be surprised by approaching humans. [10] They are also likely to attack when protecting food. [22]  Brown bears [ edit ]     Illustration of a brown bear attacking Russian hunters    As a rule, brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and will attack if they are surprised or feel threatened. [23] Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. Habituated or food conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and in some cases associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with no attacks being recorded against parties of more than seven people. [24] In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and in some cases death. [23] In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound, [10] and seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to "disarm" their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn. [25] Such a bite can be more severe than that of a tiger, and has been known to crush the heads of some human victims. [13]  Most attacks occur in the months of July, August and September, the time when the number of outdoor recreationalists, such as hikers or hunters, is higher. People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back. [10]  Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the former Soviet Union , though exceptions exist in districts where they are not pursued by hunters. [26]  East Siberian brown bears for example tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more frequently hunted European counterparts . [27] In 2008, a platinum mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 Kamchatka brown bears that killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes. [28] In Scandinavia, only three fatal attacks were recorded in the 20th century. [29] Due to increasing brown bear population in Turkey , attacks still occur in mountainous areas of Northeastern Turkey. [30]  Native American tribes whose territories overlapped with those of grizzly bears often viewed them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act was done with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4 to 10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies. [25] Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately 1 per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, though it increased to 4 per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to 1 injury every 2 years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Between 1980-2002, there were only 2 grizzly bear-caused human injuries in a developed area. However, although grizzly attacks were rare in the back-country before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately 1 per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. [31]  Polar bears [ edit ]  Polar bear attacks on humans are extremely rare, but according to records by James Wilder, there have been only 20 fatal polar bear attacks out of 73 fatal attacks between 1870 and 2014. Polar bear attacks can also happen in captivity like Binky.  Sloth bears [ edit ]  In some areas of India and Burma , sloth bears are more feared than tigers, due to their unpredictable temperament. [32] In Madhya Pradesh , sloth bear attacks accounted for the deaths of 48 people and the injuring of 686 others between the years 1989 and 1994, probably due in part to the density of population and competition for food sources. [33] One specimen, known as the sloth bear of Mysore , was single-handedly responsible for the deaths of 12 people and the mutilation of 2 dozen others before being shot by Kenneth Anderson . Sloth bears defend themselves when surprised, with the majority of confrontations occurring at night. They typically charge on all fours with their head held low, before rearing on their hind legs and striking at their attackers with their claws and teeth. [34]  Natural weapons [ edit ]  The various species of bears are well-developed for survival, both for attaining food and defending against predators, including unarmed humans. The different species all have the same general physical characteristics and senses that allow them to adapt to situations that threaten their survival.  Fur [ edit ]  A bear's fur is often very thick, and it can function much like armor. In situations between bears and other predators, such as humans, this thick fur acts with the bear's thick skin and layers of fat as a buffer against most physical attacks, sometimes buffering to some extent even against firearms. [35] According to Charles Fergus' Wild Guide: Bears , bear fur is also a source of insulation that allows bears to inhabit almost any habitat, from the hot jungles inhabited by sun bears and sloth bears to the frozen tundra inhabited by polar bears, thus occupying most of the same territory as man. [36]  Muscle [ edit ]  A bear's muscular structure is highly suited for strength and power. Polar bears are known to swim for miles in search of food and to scoop 450-pound seals out of the water. [36] An analogue to a bear for muscle for its size is a dog, an animal stronger than humans per unit of weight and never bred to sizes of an adult black bear.  Grizzly bears can bring down prey, such as bison or moose , that outweigh the bear by several hundred pounds and can steal kills from entire packs of wolves. Their top speed running on all fours has been reported to be around 40 mph (60 km/h); [37] [38] comparatively, Usain Bolt ran at a record-breaking speed of 27 mph (43 km/h) at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [39] Most people are incapable of reaching speeds even remotely close to this number; thus, it is impossible for a human to outrun a bear.  Claws [ edit ]     Claws and pawprints of an American black bear (left) and brown bear    Bears have five digits on each dextrous paw, each digit with a long non-retractable claw. The shape of the claw differs between the bear species: black bear claws are strong and curved, which allows them to claw at tree bark; grizzly bear claws are long and straight, ideal for digging, and can be up to six inches long; [40] [41] polar bear claws are thick and sharp for holding the slippery skins of seals. [40]  Jaws [ edit ]  The jaws of a bear reflect its omnivorous eating habits. A bear has forty-two teeth, with canines, which can be even longer than those of a tiger of which the lower ones are very suitable curved to ram. While a bear's canines can pierce flesh and tear meat, a bear's back teeth are relatively flat, better suited for eating plants rather than meat. However, the jaws of bears are controlled by large muscles that are capable of crushing bones, which gives access to the nutritious marrow within. [9] [42] Some grizzly bears have jaws that can bite through 6-inch-thick (150 mm) pine trees. [43]  Humans in contrast have thirty-two teeth, sixteen on each jaw, each tooth less than a half-inch long. Of these teeth, there are four incisors, two canines, four premolars, and six molars. While human incisors are capable of biting into meat, bears have more powerful jaw muscles, which make their bite more destructive to flesh. [44] More appropriate comparisons to bear dentition are to those of dogs whose teeth are similar in proportion to those of bears (and of course much smaller, although capable of inflicting much damage even at their smaller size).  Other senses and characteristics [ edit ]  Bears' senses are likely similar to those of dogs, animals that at times have much the same build and dietary habits of bears.  Bears' sense of smell is dependent on a Jacobson's organ, or vomeronasal organ , which allows the bear to easily detect airborne scents. [45] Bears use this sense of smell not only to hunt, but to detect other bears as well; male bears use smell to stay away from other male bears and to find female bears during mating season. While humans have a sense of olfaction, or smell, they do not use it for communication or for hunting; its usual range is around 10 square centimeters as compared to a polar bear that can smell a seal from twenty miles away. [45] [46]  Little is known about a bear's hearing, but scientists concluded that it is at least as good as a human's. [40] Some scientists believe that bears may even be able to detect ultrasonic sounds as well. [40]  Natural observers believe that most bear species are near-sighted, which allows bears to forage for small objects such as berries. [40] However, bears are also capable of discerning faraway movements, helping them hunt prey. [40] The Kodiak bear, when compared to other species, appears to have vision comparable to a human (not near-sighted). Experiments show that black bears can see color, unlike many mammals. [40] With scientists still working to determine exactly how perceptive bear eyes are, it is difficult to compare bear eyesight with human eyesight.  Causes of bear attacks [ edit ]  Almost all recorded bear attacks in the wild have resulted from the human surprising the bear. Hunters are the people most at risk of bear attacks because, as Tom Smith, a U.S. Geographical Survey research biologist, describes, "Hunters typically aren't making any noise, and they sleuth around while wearing camo." [47] Hunters try to be silent and, though many hunters wear reflective clothing so as not to become targets for other hunters, they try to hide their movements so as not to startle game. Most bear attacks result from hunters suddenly appearing in front of them, startling a bear into an instinctive act of aggression.  However, a bear's first reaction upon detecting a human is to run away. [2] Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from thousands of years ago when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. [2] Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. [2] Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before. [2]  Protecting young [ edit ]     Most bear attacks happen when a mother bear senses a dangerous approach to her offspring    One of the most dangerous situations that leads to bear attacks is when a bear perceives a threat to her offspring. Female bears are very defensive of their young, devoting, on their own without any participation of the male bear, many years of their lives just to raise their cubs and teach them to hunt, hence the term "mama bear" to refer to extremely reactive and protective mothers of humans, particularly those who do this without paternal care. [48] While solo bears will usually retreat, a mother bear protecting her cubs is mostly likely to attack any sudden threat. Black bears present something of an exception to this, however, as mother black bears sometimes urge their cubs to climb trees for safety instead of remaining on the ground to protect their young. [49]  Hunger [ edit ]  Another dangerous situation is when a human is faced with a hungry bear that has lost its natural fear of humans. With the decrease of hunting grounds and food crops such as berries and bark, bears often become more desperate and aggressive. [43] However, this hunger has also triggered an unexpected reaction: bears began to follow gunfire because they associate it with dead animals that they can eat. [43]  Once a bear claims an animal carcass, it becomes very protective of its kill. This becomes a problem when a bear claims a hunter's kill, as the hunter may not wish to kill the bear as well. By avoiding a bear over a carcass, the risk of attack is reduced by around fifty percent. [47]  Recovery from bear attacks [ edit ]  Aside from the large lacerations, fractures, and other wounds that can result from bear attacks, infections are also physically detrimental. A bear's mouth is full of potentially harmful bacteria, especially if the bear has been feeding on a gut pile or feces. Bear bites can result in infections common to most animal bites, including abscesses, septicemia, and even rabies. Though there is little data, what is available from bear bite statistics indicate that bears don't tend to carry many of the most well-known dangerous anaerobic bacteria strains in their normal oral flora; [50] however, given the circumstances around most bear attacks, wound contamination from the environment is highly likely and means there is risk for tetanus and other external microbial agents.  Recovery from bear attacks depends on the extent of damage, but often involves long-term medical treatment. As shown in the medical procedure led by Professor Shuzhong Guo, extreme cases of bear attacks have resulted in plastic surgeries and even facial transplants that, while successful, may take several years to complete and are sometimes fatal.

Bird feeders and unsecured pet food, garbage and grills may be bringing them to your back door.  Adapted from the book Wild Neighbors      Black bears eat mostly plants but sometimes find easy food sources in bird feeders, pet food and garbage.

Photo by iStockphoto.com     As black bear numbers increase in some North American communities and more people move into bear habitat, encounters between bears and people have risen. Whether you live in bear country or are just visiting, you can take simple steps to avoid conflicts.   Why bears lose their fear of humans  How to prevent conflicts with bears  Why hunting doesn’t solve conflicts with bears  What to do if you encounter a black bear  Bears and public health concerns  Other resources   Why bears lose their fear of humans  Bears have acute eyesight and hearing. Their sense of smell is seven times greater than a bloodhound’s. They have a keen ability to detect pet food, garbage, barbecue grills and bird feeders—and once they locate a food source, they remember where it is.  Bears are normally wary of people, but if a bear finds food without getting frightened away, he may come back for more. Each time this happens, he can become less fearful—and this habituation can lead to problems. Conflicts can heighten during hyperphagia, a feeding frenzy in late summer and fall in which bears bulk up for hibernation, gaining 3-4 pounds and consuming 20,000 calories a day.  Bears who lose their fear of people are called “nuisance bears.” These are most often subadult males—young bears who have just dispersed from their mothers and are still learning how to obtain food—and mothers with young cubs. In many states, nuisance bears are killed or trapped and moved far away in hopes that they won’t come back. But most of the time this outcome wouldn’t have been necessary if people hadn’t made food so easy to find in the yard or trash dumpster.  Animal Proof Trash Cans on Amazon.com »  How to prevent conflicts with bears  To avoid habituating the bears in your area, follow these steps.  Make trash cans inaccessible. Bring them inside at night or buy a bear-resistant trash can or an enclosure for the container.  Enclose your compost pile. Open compost piles, especially those that include kitchen scraps, are an irresistible treat in bear country. Burying compost won’t work because bears will easily find and dig it up.  Recycle wisely. If you store recyclables outside, use enclosed bins. (Persistent bears will break into even ruggedly built bins.)  Keep your barbecue grill clean and as free of drippings as possible. Move the grill away from your house when you aren’t using it, and clean it regularly with ammonia or bleach.  Rethink your bird feeders. In the summer, birds can make do with naturally available foods. If you do set up feeders, install them away from your house.  Communities experiencing bear problems can take steps such as fining people who knowingly or unknowingly feed bears, requiring bear-resistant trash cans, distributing educational flyers and training police and animal control officers in aversive conditioning techniques that use rubber bullets, fireworks and pepper spray.  Biologist Stephen Herrero: “There’s no question that it’s possible for people and bears to coexist without serious problems if we’re willing to manage our food and garbage.” Read our story on how some communities in bear country are coping »  Why hunting doesn’t solve conflicts with bears  When communities start experiencing conflicts with bears, too often state wildlife agencies institute a hunt or raise the quota of an existing hunt. But a host of studies show that hunting does nothing to resolve human-bear conflicts; hunters target bears in the woods, not the ones causing problems near human habitation.  Hunting also does not permanently reduce bear populations. Numbers actually rebound with the increased availability of food.  What to do if you encounter a black bear  If you see a black bear in your yard, don’t fear the worst. A youngster may simply be passing through in search of a home of his own. Or an adult may be checking out an enticing smell or interesting sound. Usually when he finds out there are people around, he’ll head for the hills, never to be seen again.  If you do encounter a bear, remain calm and remember that the bear is likely more scared of you than you are of him. Attacks by black bears on people are very rare and most black bears can be easily scared away with the following approach:   Stand and face the bear directly. Never run away from or approach him.  Make yourself look as big as possible by spreading your arms or, better yet, a coat.  Make as much noise as possible by yelling, banging pots and pans or using other noisemaking devices.  If the bear approaches and you have bear spray, spray the bear as he approaches.  In the very rare case that a black bear does attack you, fight back (don’t play dead).  After the bear leaves, remove whatever attracted him to the location (barbecue grill, bird feeder, pet food or garbage).   (Please note that these directions are specific for black bears; check here for information about what to do if you encounter a grizzly bear.)  Bears and public health concerns  People have little to fear in terms of catching diseases or parasites from bears. As warm-blooded animals, bears can get rabies, but it is very rare. There are no known cases of a person catching rabies from a bear.

View Images      Most bear attacks happen when people get too close to bears. Here, a photographer shoots photos of a brown bear in Alaska.    Photograph by Roy Toft, National Geographic Creative            PUBLISHED September 16, 2015     From the mountains of Maryland to the swamps of Florida to the snowy peaks of the U.S. West, bears are making a comeback.   Thanks to regulated hunting and more habitat, "there's a pretty dramatic increase in bear populations across the U.S., and people are going to be encountering bears more and more," says Dave Garshelis, bear project leader at the Minnesota Department of  Natural Resources. (Related: " Black Bears Are Rebounding—What Does That Mean For People? ")   In August, a grizzly bear killed a hiker in Yellowstone National Park—a tragic yet extremely rare event, experts say. The chances of being injured by a bear are approximately 1 in 2.1 million, according to the National Park Service . In other words, you're more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear.    Living With the Wild. As bear populations rebound across the United States, and as people increasingly move into their habitat, bear-human run-ins are inevitable. This is one of several stories asking: How do we live with the predators ?   To gain more insight into bear attacks and how to prevent them, scientists recently completed a study—not yet published—examining 675 bear attacks on people. Their research revealed distinct patterns of bear behavior that can help people stay safe in bear habitat.   “There is a lot of mythology out there about why bear attacks happen,” says Tom Smith , a biologist at Brigham Young University in Utah.   “If I wanted to make a key point, it is that the vast majority of these negative encounters are avoidable. People don’t need to go out into bear country and get hurt, nor do bears. These incidents are largely preventable, but humans have to take more responsibility.”   Here's how to be smart in bear habitat—whether it's in the deep wilderness or your own backyard.   Know your bears.   North America is home to three bear species: The black bear , brown bear (a species that includes the grizzly bear) , and polar bear .                Range of polar bear (Ursus maritimus)     Range of brown bear (Ursus arctos)     Range of American black bear (Ursus americanus)             arctic  Ocean    Greenland    canada    North  america    Pacific  Ocean    United  States    atlantic  Ocean    500 mi    mexico    500 km        NG STAFF     Find out which species live in the place where you live or plan to travel. Some places, such as Montana's Glacier National Park , are home to both grizzlies and black bears. It can be difficult to tell them apart, since black bears can also be brown, like grizzlies. However, black bears are generally smaller.  Notably, Smith says, brown bears inflicted more injuries than any other species in Alaska. The average brown bear encounter is more dangerous—3.5 times more likely to result in injury—than the average polar bear encounter, and 21 times more dangerous than the average black bear encounter, according to Smith and colleague Stephen Herrero, professor emeritus at the University of Calgary in Canada.  More than half of the attacks in the new analysis were over in less than three minutes, “consistent with the notion that the primary motivation for attacking bears is to neutralize a perceived threat, and once that is done they go on their way,” Smith says.  Don't unwittingly attract them.  Bears have a better sense of smell than dogs and love humans' food. So the main strategy to avoid run-ins is to minimize any scents or attractants on your body, campsite, or property.  "If you're a hiker, be more careful about various kind of scents and things that you would have on you," such as food, deodorant, and even chewing gum, Garshelis says.  Carry bear spray.  "The absolute best thing" to prevent a bear attack, particularly for grizzlies, is to use bear spray, a type of pepper spray, Garshelis says. (See " What Happens to Problem Bears That Go to Rehab? ")  He recommends people practice in advance how to operate the spray, including being familiar with far it shoots. (Practice outdoors and upwind; bear spray is powerful stuff.) He also says a person traveling in bear country should wear the spray on a holster in front of their bodies, so that they're not fumbling for it if they run smack into a grizzly.  In a 2008 study that also involved Smith and Herrero, scientists found that bear spray was 92 percent effective in deterring attacks from the three species of North American bear in Alaska between 1985 and 2006. Ninety-eight percent of people carrying bear spray who got into close encounters with bears were uninjured.      Travel in groups.  Being alone in the wilderness can be fulfilling, but for safety's sake it's better to walk in a group of three people or more, he says. A bear is more likely to retreat if it sees or smells several people walking toward it than if a single person approaches. (See "Why Are Black Bear Attacks Up in Florida? ")  "For the most part, they want to avoid us," he says.  Of the people injured by bears in Yellowstone National Park since 1970, 91 percent were hiking alone or with one other person .  If dogs are allowed in the area where you'll be, it's generally a good idea to bring them, since the canines often scare away bears. However, this approach can backfire: If a dog is ahead of its owner and then runs into a bear, the bear may chase it, which is not only dangerous to the dog but could endanger humans if the dog runs back to its owner.  Be alert for signs of bears.  If you see fresh scat, for instance, a bear has recently passed by. "It's a good idea to be very alert. Think through, 'How am I going to react?'"  Don't let yourself fall into a daze, either—stay present and look around as you walk.  If you're attacked or pursued, react according to the species of bear.  "Typically if you're in a place where there's just black bears, you would be bold and aggressive to a bear that approaches you," says Garshelis. Throwing things, standing tall, and yelling will drive away most black bears—although that strategy isn't foolproof.  "I've seen pretty scary videos where black bears have actually attacked people when they're doing everything right," he says. "Nothing's 100 percent." (Related: " What Do You Do With a Bear That Kills a Person ?")  If you run into a grizzly, your approach should be the opposite: Backing away slowly and getting away from the situation without provoking the animal, he says.  That's especially true with female grizzly bears with cubs, which can be particularly dangerous. (See " Video of Yellowstone Bear Chasing Tourists Isn't What You Think .")  When threatened, female grizzlies will often stand up, slap the ground, and make blowing sounds. However, "that means it's nervous; it's not aggressive," he says.  In Smith and Herrero's analysis of 675 bear attacks in Alaska, the vast majority of incidents in which bears charged occurred when people and bears confronted each other at close range, within ten yards (nine meters) or less.  In more than 50 percent of those situations, the person was not physically hurt. Of the 313 cases in which the bears injured the person, 36 percent of injuries were to legs and feet, 18 percent to the back, 18 percent to arms, and 9 percent to head and neck.  Never run.  "You can't outrun a bear," Garshelis says. "The best thing to do is walk away slowly from a bear if it already clearly sees you."  Keep watching the animal as you walk away, and some experts suggest speaking out loud in a calm voice.          WATCH: A bear can go from disinterested to dangerous in an instant. Do you know what to do if you're attacked by a startled grizzly?       Know when to play dead.  Only play dead after a bear has made contact with you.   If it's a black bear, try to fight back. If that strategy doesn't work, lay on your stomach (protecting your vital organs), clasp your hands on the back of your neck, and pull up your knees. At this point, the bear may give up and leave.  If it's a grizzly, do not try to defend yourself. "Once it's on you, and there's nothing else you can do, collapse and play dead," Garshelis says.  Since 1970, Yellowstone National Park has tracked bear encounters and found that those who play dead when attacked by a bear during a surprise encounter only got minor injuries 75 percent of the time . Those who fought back, on the other hand, suffered severe injuries 80 percent of the time.  The analysis by Smith and Herrero also revealed that things don't always end well for the bear: In 600 physical run-ins with people, bears died 34 percent of the time from injury incurred during the incident or from subsequent management actions.  Be tolerant and put things in perspective.  "Tolerance goes a long way to living with wildlife," Garshelis says.  For instance, if you're a homeowner and like to put out birdseed, consider doing it in the winter, when birds really need it and when bears are hibernating—otherwise you could have an unwelcome visitor.  Also remember that bear encounters can be enjoyable, as long as you keep your distance. (See National Geographic's best bear pictures .)  "If I'm hiking and see a bear the first thing I would do is get my camera," he says. "It's usually a really nice and rather rare experience."  Follow Christine Dell'Amore on Twitter and Google+ .

Author:  Craig Medred    Updated: July 6, 2016   Published July 28, 2010             Share on Facebook   Share on Twitter   Share via Email   Share on Tumblr   Share on Reddit   Share on LinkedIn   Share on Google Plus       Print article                      The bears are out in Alaska. No surprise. It's summer.    Encounters between people and bears are in the news. No surprise. It's summer.    Misinformation is spreading around the state like wildlife. No surprise. It's summer.    The bears are supposed to be trying to kill us, right?    "Kake resident Brandon Berkley, 17, is lucky to be alive after an encounter with a black bear sow Monday morning in Kake," reports the Juneau Empire.             Really?    But don't most encounters with black bears end with the bear running off and no one hurt? Well, yes. No doubt there are people reading this right now who've met black bears and had that happen. Black bears are actually quite timid creatures whether one meets them in Alaska or any of the many other states where they are now common.    OK, Berkley did have more than an "encounter." If his story is to be believed, he was knocked cold by a black bear. There are no witnesses.    But if he was knocked cold and the bear left him unharmed after knocking him out, as has been reported, that wouldn't be out of line with what happens in most bear attacks either.             Most people attacked by bears -- including the person writing this -- survive.    According to data compiled by the Wildlife Research Institute, people are 45 times more likely to be killed by a dog than by a bear, 120 times more likely to be killed by bees than a bear, and a whopping 250 times more likely to be killed by lightening than a bear.    Yes, Berkley is lucky to be alive, but only because everyone in the U.S. is lucky to be alive. Anyone could die in a motor vehicle accident later today because scooting around in cars is the most dangerous thing most people do. The odds of being hit by lightening are about 1 in 4.2 million. The odds of dying in a motor vehicle accident are about 1 in 20,000, and the calculated lifetime odds of death from driving can drop to near 1 in 100 if you drive a lot and for a long time.    Put down the cell phone. Put both hands on the wheel. Quit worrying about the bears. Pay attention. And drive defensively.    There is a 165 times greater chance a car will kill you than a firearm will, or some of those "dangerous" things about which the authorities keep warning people. The chances of being killed by exploding fireworks? One in 39 million.    And yet, you're still more likely to be killed by fireworks than attacked by a black bear sow with a cub like Dane Havard wasn't this week in Anchorage.    "What you don't see on the video, because of where the camera was shooting from, was the sow charging at the man who tried to free the cub, but she did not attack him," reported local TV station KTUU.             Surprise, surprise, surprise. Of course "she did not attack him."    Black bear sows -- unlike grizzly bear sows -- rarely attack. Bear researchers regularly take cubs away from black bear sows to study them (they give them back) without much of a problem. Havard was in a similar situation. He was trying to free a cub caught in a dipnet . He couldn't, but the sow eventually ripped the net apart and freed the cub.    She also huffed and puffed and tried to threaten Havard, which is what sow black bears do. Sow grizzlies, on the other hand, don't threaten; they attack. That's why it's a good idea to know how to tell the difference between block-headed grizzly bears and pinched-faced black bears if you're living in or visiting in Alaska where you might, as the Anchorage Daily News reported this week, meet a whole family of bears.    "A brown bear cub rescued after a boar attacked its family near King Cove has arrived at the Alaska Zoo," the newspaper said.    "Attacked its family...." Almost makes the bears sound cute and cuddly, doesn't it?    They're not. They're no more cute and cuddly than they are unusually dangerous. They're wildlife. They live by their own rules. One of the rules for sow grizzlies (often called brown bears in Alaska though there are cinnamon-colored black bears that also look brown) is that they try to protect their cubs from "boars," as in boar grizzlies, because bears don't really have families as people know families.    Male bears are solitary critters. They show up around other bears only to feed or breed. If they run into other bears in other circumstances, they will likely as not try to kill them. Some have theorized that grizzly boars try to kill grizzly cubs to bring grizzly sows into estrus so they can breed them again.    Fortunately, the bears can tell the difference between other bears and people, and tend to avoid even approaching the latter because people have a nasty habit of putting bullets in bears. But only in the summer At least in most of Alaska.    In the winter, the black and grizzly bears are safely tucked away in hibernation, and there are no problems. But the polar bears...    Ah, the polar bears.     Contact Craig Medred at craig(at)alaskadispatch.com .                About this Author         Craig Medred                    Local news matters.

This is a place to ask questions and post comments from my website at www.bucktrack.com                                                                                           Friday, February 04, 2011      Bears: Should you be afraid?        (Grizzly rushes towards me in Alone Across Alaska .)  What are your odds of being killed by a bear? Incredibly low. So low  that it's not something to worry about. What are the facts backing up  that statement? Since interest, or perhaps morbid obsession, with fatal  bear attacks is so high, Wikipedia actually gives a reasonably good idea of the recent numbers because people rush to list "another bear attack." According to Wikipedia, in the 2000's black bears killed 15 people in  NORTH AMERICA (including Canada, the U.S., and Mexico.) Grizzlies killed  12 people during that same period, for a total of 27. For the 90's  Wikipedia lists 23 fatal attacks. Dr. Stephen Herrero, a leading  authority on human/bear conflicts, says 29 people were killed by bears  in North America in the 1990s. In other words, less than three people  are killed in North America by bears each year over the last 20 years. And that includes all the countless people in all of the most theoretically dangerous places: Yellowstone, Denali, BC, Alberta, the Yukon, Glacier.  To put things in perspective, about 2 3/4 MILLION people die each year of all causes in the U.S. and Canada .   That's well over 7,000 people every day. Other causes are about ONE  MILLION TIMES more likely to kill you than bears. So why are people  scared of bears? Partly because every fatal bear attack gets huge news  coverage. Partly because people are instinctively afraid of bears and  the unknown and the unfamiliar. This article helps explain our bear fear (thanks to SouthMark on Whiteblaze.net.)   Death Rates in the U.S . (note, these are all from recent years, mostly from 2007)   Heart disease: 616,067  Cancer: 562,875  Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 135,952  Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 127,924  Accidents (unintentional injuries): 123,706  Alzheimer's disease: 74,632  Diabetes: 71,382  Influenza and Pneumonia: 52,717  Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 46,448  Motor Vehicle Accidents : 40,000  Septicemia: 34,828  Suicide : 30,000  Poisoning : 22,700  Falls : 21,600  Murder : 16,929  Drowning : 4,000  Boating: 339  Horseback riding : 200  Hypothermia : 187  Lightning : 90  Bee sting : 55  Dogs : 30  Snake bite : 5  Bear attack (average over 20 years in the U.S): 1.3  With about 16,929 murders a year in the US and Canada combined out of a total population of about 334,000,000, about 1 out of 19,625 people will be a murderer in a given year.  With about 3 fatal bear attacks per year in the US and Canada combined, and about 660,000 bears in the US and Canada total, about 1 out of 220,000 bears will be "murderers" in a given year.  In Stephen Herrero's great book Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance (revised edition) he says this: Bear  attacks are rare events. I told her that in North America there are an  estimated six hundred thousand black bears and sixty thousand grizzly  bears. Each year there are millions of times in which each species is  close to people and no threat or injury results... I hate to see  people's lives crippled by fear based on ignorance.  So what should you do with this information? Follow a few simple precautions and simply enjoy your trip into bear country. Trust me, you'll be fine.

I'm a hiker and do not fear bears. I respect them and act in a safe manner during the extremely rare times I encounter them on the trails. (Mostly in the GSMNP in NC and in Mt. Mitchell State Park in NC.) I have heard MANY bears run FROM me in the GSMNP. How did I know it was bears? Because no other animals make that distinctive "bear groan", I guess you would describe it. I even unknowingly walked up pretty close to a sow with cubs in GSMNP and wasn't threatened and am obviously not dead at the current time. Hopefully this article will calm the really absurd fears of some people and / or the family members of people who go into the forests. All I've heard since the announcement of my plans to do a through hike of the GSMNP in March 2011 is "Take some bear spray." LOL.. I have no intention of peeing away around 60 bucks and carrying another pound of weight for such a useless can of junk. Reply Delete Buck 9:18 AM Hi Eddie, Thanks for the comment! I hope some real world facts will help calm your family. You are right, respecting bears is smart, fearing them is unnecessary. There is no need to carry bear spray on the Appalachian Trail, that's for sure. One place I can think of that I might carry bear spray is on some of the roadside fishing streams in Alaska where habituated brown bears hang out trying to get fish parts from nearby salmon fisherman. So far, though, I've never bought a can of bear spray. Buck Reply Delete George 12:17 PM This is more info to help me get my wife to backpack with me. She a huge bearfobic. Darn TV. Thanx Reply Delete Anonymous 11:59 PM Doesn't this require a more detailed statistical analysis? How about comparing the number of human-bear encounters that result in death compared to the number of human-human encounters that do?     With 334 million people in the US and Canada, there has to a couple billion human-human encounters every day.   How many human-bear encounters per day  - statiscally you can round that to none. What is the North American bee population compared to bears? Reply Delete Buck 5:59 AM Hi Anonymous, I think the "murder rate" for humans vs. bears addresses the basic point you are trying to make. On an individual basis, a random human is over 10 times more likely than a bear to kill a person on a given year. As Dr. Herrero says, there are millions of human/bear encounters per year, most of which people are unaware. If you can round those millions of encounters to zero, it seems like with 3 fatalities per year for 334,000,000 people, it would be fair to round that number to zero, also. Even when encountering a bear, the odds of it killing you are about one out of a million. (3 fatalities/millions of encounters.) Reply Delete Zoya, Patrick, Nora and Stuart 9:12 AM I live and hunt on Kodiak, and bearanoia has always been a pet peeve of mine - I even wrote a blog post about it one time.  I checked into the numbers here on Kodiak and I believe that more people have been murdered by their hunting partner than killed by bears (I think 2 people have been killed by bears in the last 100 years).  I only carry a rifle when hunting, and I'm not sure I'd use it on a charging bear.  I've been charged a few times and they all stopped.  Now if I'd shot at them would they have stopped?  I do not think it is a coincidence that all the people who have been mauled or killed were carrying firearms.  Patrick Reply Delete Zoya, Patrick, Nora and Stuart 9:27 AM Buck,  Great Post!  And if you want to read my blog post about bearanoia - it was my entry from July 19, 2008 (I could hot link it here, but I'm always leery of that sort of thing in comments I get from strangers - so I assume you are too!).  I titled it 'bearanoia will destroy you'.  Also pepper spray is VERY effective. I once used it on a bear and It worked.  Patrick Reply Delete Buck 9:42 AM Hi Patrick, Thanks for your posts. Very interesting points you made. People reading what you said should note that you live on Kodiak Island, land of the largest bears in the world. Here is a link to your blog post, which is well worth reading. Thanks again! Buck Reply Delete Zoya, Patrick, Nora and Stuart 5:09 PM Buck I saw the uproar your post caused on the AK hunting forum. You got the same reaction I usually get here on Kodiak when I make the same point. But the stats are true - even if you limit it to just hunters in the field here on Kodiak - far more people drown, die of hypothermia, fall off of cliffs, get shot by a hunting buddy etc than ever get killed by bears.  And most maulings are in situations were people surprise or threaten a bear.  Bears do the swat/bite educate thing and keep on running (this according to the local bear biologist). That said - I do take precautions.  For instance when hunting I never return to a kill site but carry a whole animal away after butchering - and we take 5 people when we hunt elk just so we can get it all out in one load. All that said, I did have a REALLY bad charge this Fall on Afognak when we surprised a mom and three cubs in the woods.  She charged twice and got up to about 15 feet away the second time.  But I was not worried about getting killed - I had a feeling I'd just get swatted.  And who knows what would have happened if we'd shot at the bear.  And it must be said that we only surprised the bear because we were creeping through the forest upwind looking for elk.  Not what I'd normally recommend doing when hiking in bear country. Patrick Reply Delete Replies Unknown 1:36 AM What do you do when a bear comes up to you to not be attacked? Bearaphobic here. Delete Buck 2:13 PM Firstly, I think about that even an approaching bear almost certainly isn't going to hurt me at all, it's just approaching to see what I am. When it smells me, or gets a real good look, it will run. To lessen the already low danger of an approaching bear that's spotted me, I'll usually talk loud enough in a calm voice so it can hear me, stand up on a rock or a high spot if there's one nearby, and open my jacket to make myself look bigger. Most importantly I won't run. There are over 30,000 grizzlies/brown bears in Alaska, and it's been YEARS since the last fatality. Carrying bear spray is probably a good idea to ease your worries. Have fun! Buck Delete Reply Buck 6:03 PM Good points, Patrick. It's important not to surprise bears at close range. That's probably what I'm most cautious about. Getting the game kill out all at once is also wise. In Wyoming once were on horseback heading back to an elk kill and came around a corner to find a grizz and her cubs heading towards our horses. That made my heart pound. But I can honestly say I was more afraid of what the horses were going to do than what the bears were going to do! Luckily those horses had nerves of steel. The grizzlies immediately turned and fled. One thing that skews people's perception somewhat, I think, is that when people shoot a bear that seems threatening it's human nature for people to assume that if the bear hadn't been killed it would have resulted in a mauling, or worse. Maybe it would have, but most likely it wouldn't have. That's something that will always be the decision of the individual, though, and it's certainly not my place to second guess individual cases if I wasn't there. I certainly believe it is someone's right to defend their own life if necessary. Reply Delete Anonymous 4:55 AM Thanks, I liked the article.  But, you do make an error in the probabilities.  You are using rates per all people for all possible risks.  The reality is the denominator has to change to be only those involved in the activity.  Comparing all the causes of death is apples-to-oranges the way you do it. For example, to accurately show the probability of dying in a car accident, you should exclude the population who don't ever ride in a car. For bear deaths, the proper rate would be to exclude all people who never venture into bear territory.  When I am venturing out on a hike, what is relevant to me is the odds of getting attacked among people who go out for hikes, not among the general population which includes millions who never go outside. Looking at it this way would probably increase your probability of a bear attack by maybe even 100 times. Still -- the odds are really small.  And, it seems to me that those that do get attacked usually do something really stupid to provoke it.  As long as you are careful about your food and give them their space, there is very little risk. Seems like the reality is that a handful of people a year will be killed by bears, and almost every one of them would have done something really stupid to provoke the attack. You are more at risk driving to the trail than hiking! Reply Delete Buck 6:21 AM Hi Anonymous 4:55, I can see you you know something about probabilities. You are right of course, that the odds aren't equal for all people. I don't come right out and say that, but I allude to it by phrases like "all the people in all of the most dangerous places." Like many sets of stats the "user" has to apply them sensibly to their own real-world situation. I was debating the general issue with a grizzly bear hunting guide on another forum, and I pointed out that even for a grizzly guide, perhaps the people at highest risk of being attacked by a bear, easily thousands of times greater than the average American, the risk of dying by bear are STILL relatively low: for every grizzly guide killed or injured by bears there will be hundreds killed or seriously injured on the road, flying, in avalanches, drowning, by a poor diet etc. As you pointed out, 100 times near zero is still near zero. Follow the precautions in the link in the original post, and it doesn't pay to worry about bears. Reply Delete HMG7 3:56 AM Hey Buck! Here's a story for you--- I'd given myself a 5-day AT hike excursion for my  birthday, from Wallingford to S. Pomfret, Vermont, but was stopped short just after I'd reached the Cooper Shelter near the summit of Killington. Here's what happened: Having arrived at 3pm after a 9.9 mile hike from the Clarendon shelter, my feet were achy. I rested awhile but then couldn't resist that 2/10th of a mile (straight up!) on the off-trail that goes up to the summit for that gorgeous 360 view of the Green Mountains. Well----I get 100 feet from my goal, my 18-pound pack on my back, and a 4-pound fanny pack around my waist carrying all survival essentials, and decide I  want to enjoy the last 100 feet without that extra 18 pounds. Against that "inner small voice of better judgement", I drop the big pack on the rocky climb just to have the freedom of scurrying up those last feet to enjoy the summit. "I'll just be five minutes, it'll be okay."  Well, I revel in the view and then start exploring a bit into the woodsy areas, only to find one pile of bear scat after another. "Oh, sh---!" I scurry back down the rocks and of course, the pack is gone, nowhere in site,  99% certain there were no hikers anywhere near that would have taken it. I was alone at the top. So my theory---Yogi Bear was on the scent trail of the gorp in my big pack, gave a big YAHOO! when Ms. Backpacker dropped the pot o' gold and then dragged it off. There went my Thermarest, sleeping bag, extra socks (and cute new lightweight hoodie my guy had bought me for my birthday for the trip!)---and his iPhone battery charger along with some other minor stuff. Arg! So anyone out there in blog-land heading toward the Cooper Shelter, who's also planning on checking out the off-trail to the summit, would you be on the lookout for a red pack? I'd love to get that cute hoodie back!!    ; )  *grin. Reply to this blog . . . Anyway--- I'm just glad my guy had Google Earth to spot me and tell me via my iPhone that I was 500 feet from the grassy ski slope and then another 1000 ft from a Killington access road! He'd met me 35 min. later with two tacos, sympathetic eyes, and tons of bear jokes to get me laughing again. Now that's a story for the grandchildren one day! Love and happy trekking to you, Buck, all you AT hikers out there . . . Reply Delete Buck 6:20 AM Thanks for the story HMG7. There's always something new to learn, isn't there? Bears will definitely steal food if they think they can get away with it. Reply Delete Waldo4me 2:24 PM I, too, know a bit about statistics.  The problem with the various statements made is that no one is able to clearly identify and quantify the set.  As anonymous pointed out, these "statistics" are essentially invalid.  Based on everything I have read, the real answer is "we don't know".  Of course, it's much more sensational (or comforting) to throw around some big numbers.  Today's (7/12/11) edition of the the Cody Enterprise quotes Kerry Gunther saying that your chances of being killed by a grizzly are 1 in 3 million.  That's just statistical nonsense. I live in grizzly habitat and encounter them quite often.  So far, no problems and I'd estimate I've been close to about 40.  According to Kerry I have 2,999,960 to go! All in all, a good article and I agree with the basic premise.  But, telling the truth would be a better idea. Reply Delete Buck 3:29 PM Waldo4me, All in all, a good article and I agree with the basic premise. But, telling the truth would be a better idea. Your statement seems contradictory. What exactly is the truth? It seems to me that we can either evaluate risk by our general impressions based on what we've heard or what we've experienced or how we feel, or we can attempt to quantify the risk with some real world numbers. That's what I've attempted to do. People often argue against statistics when they don't like what the numbers show. I am amazed at how resistant people are to applying numbers to the risk from bears. Take this quote: "If  he is a smoker,  the odds for  a 50-year-old man [dying of cancer] more than quadruple, to 21 out of 1,000. " Now I could argue that it's a misleading stat that doesn't apply directly to an individual. Some people are more genetically inclined to get cancer, some may live in heavy radon areas, etc. However, the gist of the statistic is that smoking is relatively dangerous. You can parse it out any way you want and focus on one tree and ignore the forest, or you can see my stats for what they are, a rough way to illustrate that the risk from bears is relatively low. About one out of 100 MILLION people die from bear attack on this continent in an average year. You might think that that statistic is meaningless. I don't. Reply Delete Waldo4me 7:50 PM Take this quote: "If he is a smoker, the odds for a 50-year-old man [dying of cancer] more than quadruple, to 21 out of 1,000." That's exactly the point.  Your risk of lung cancer is elevated if you smoke.  If you go through life not smoking the statistic doesn't apply. Now, I've lived within an hour or so of YNP all my life and I've hiked thousands of miles through the park.  On any given day there are thousands of people at Fishing Bridge, Old Faithful et al and, there is hardly anyone on the back country trails.  Since guessing seems to be OK, I'll guess more than 95% of the people who visit YNP never leave the asphalt road or a developed attraction.  What do you think? So, let's suppose of the 3 million annual visitors, maybe 150,000 get into the backcountry.  You might think that would be 150,000 to 1 odds.  It's not.  The interactions are measured factorially not arithmetically.  I'd say it would be in the neighborhood of 30,000 to 1.  To measure the chances of a bear encounter or fatality based on the total number of visitors to the park is invalid, unreasonable and simply not true.  You can take all the potshots at me you want but it won't change the math. Once again, I'm on your side.  The chances of a bear encounter are very slim.  It just seems to me that we'd all be better served by presenting facts not made up statistics. I'm done.  You can have the last word. Reply Delete Buck 10:09 PM Waldo, the sources of my stats are cited. My point about smoking is perfectly valid. If you smoke your odds of dying from smoking are high. If you venture into bear country your odds of dying from bears are extremely low. If you never encounter smoke or never go into bear country stats applying to either don't apply. It doesn't make them meaningless. Using your made up statistic(!) of 150,000 backcountry visits for Yellowstone per year with one fatality in the last 25 years, that's 3,750,000 backcountry Yellowstone visits with one fatality. Of the six fatal Yellowstone bear attacks in recorded history that I can find, 2 were in the frontcountry, so your insinuation that only the backcountry visitors are at risk is incorrect. I live in grizzly bear country too and have encountered many bears, scores if not hundreds (I believe it was 17 in two days last year) here and in Yellowstone. My odds of being killed by a bear are not zero, but they are near zero. The odds absolutely vary, affected by innumerable factors that are impossible to nail down accurately. In a case like that common sense tells me to step back and take a look at the big picture. To me the big picture says that I should be aware of bears but don't worry about them even though I'm subject to a dramatically higher risk than the average American. The degree of stress and worry that people expend towards bears is unwarranted by the facts. Reply Delete Anonymous 1:54 PM As was mentioned early on, you have a much better chance of being killed by another human. Statistically, according to the last figures I saw a few years ago, merely displaying a firearm is sufficient to cause over 80 percent of aggressive humans to back off, even if an assault is in progress. It's still a more or less free country so take whatever chances you like. My choice is to go armed. Reply Delete Anonymous 11:52 AM I love hiking, but am a bear-aphobe to the point where it does cripple me. Black bears don't bother me, it's the grizz that really really scare me. They seem to be agressive, and will protect cubs. I understand my phobia is irrational, but it is real and would love to overcome it. Everything in this article is true and there is nothing I can do to convince myself. I will wear bells, hike in groups, even carry bear spray, but still it doesn't ease the pain. Please someone out there, do you have any suggestions for lowering the phobia? Reply Delete Buck 3:34 PM Anonymous, First of all thanks for being rational about the actual odds! Nearly all of us have an irrational level of fear for certain things. One thing I know that helps many people for their bear fear is more exposure time. Many people on the Appalachian Trail, for example, are afraid to go to sleep the first few nights and barely even think about bears a few weeks later. Maybe someone else has more suggestions? Reply Delete TimothyD11 3:00 PM I finally got out to Glacier National Park and did some hiking and I was concerned about the grizzlies - we just made lots of noise and hoped for the best! I would like to do backpacking trips in Glacier NP and beyond but grizzlies do have me a little worried / concerned. I guess the key is to go in large groups and make a lot of noise and have your bear spray ready to go in a second. Then you think of those rare occasions a bear decides to drag you out of your tent at night and make you dinner. I guess people worry not because of the likelihood of something happening - it is highly unlikely - but because of how absolutely terrifying the thought of it happening - I mean, I could think of a thousand ways I'd rather go that being shredded and eaten by a grizzly bear. Reply Delete Replies Buck 5:03 PM I just spent over 2 months by myself in the most brown bear dense area of North America, Admiralty Island. http://bucktrack.com/Alaska_Survival_Journal.html I have spent about 34 years in Alaska. I don't know anyone dragged out of their tent and killed, I don't know anyone killed by a bear in any fashion. That's how rare it is. You're right though, TimothyD11, people are scared of the thought of it happening. It's so rare worrying about it actually happening is a waste of time. Basic precautions and enjoying your trip is the way to go! Delete Reply Navatha K 10:26 AM This comment has been removed by a blog administrator. Reply Delete Anonymous 10:40 PM "We don't know" is indeed accurate, more data must be collected. More bears studied and more research done on how they behave, which seem by all accounts of folks "petting and befriending" then that they are rather loveable big bears who fear humans. And humans are fucking dangerous. Guns and cars consistently kills bears, so they learn from that humans are dangerous to them. More bear research is needed to first say We don't fully know enough. And instead of media hyperbolic fear mongering maybe the media can honestly admit "we don't know" pfff media likes to "make story" usually for money/profit... The fear of bears is exactly like "fear of satan".... That which people don't understand they fear/demonize. I accept my satanic inner bear. Fun concept/idea would be the apex predator realizing that we are the ones to be afraid of. Both our friends, relatives, and ourselves in the powers of action of all of our deity. If only we could respect the great bear and respect each other. Bah humbug! Humans would rather fear and worship an invisible God than love each other. In the words of ultron "humans are so doomed" .... May the beareth rise forth as the kind beast it is and expose violent humanity for the ugly beast it is...

Reply Delete Replies Buck 11:50 AM I think experience is one of the best teachers. Many Appalachian Trail hikers are afraid of bears the first days and later in their hike barely think about them. So get out there!  Carrying bear spray will help build your confidence as well. Buck Delete Reply Jim Thode 8:21 PM This thread is quite old, can I still post? Reply Delete Replies Buck 4:37 AM Absolutely! Delete Jim Thode 6:35 PM Thanks Buck.  I agree with one of the previous comments on your risk assessment.  Normal life hazards are too far removed from hazards from grizzly bears to compare the two.  Most people are never put in a situation were a bear interaction is even remotely possible.   On the other hand it could be said with 100% accuracy that the chance of getting mauled or killed by a grizzly in wilderness type areas where grizzlies live is infinitely greater then in other wilderness areas where no grizzlies live.  Many that enjoy public access to public lands see that more bears equals less public access.   I’m thinking of mostly grizzly bears and ongoing push to widen their existing range. So, to original question, “should you be afraid of (grizzly) bears?” I say yes for a few reasons.  Grizzly bears are named Ursus arctos horribilis for good reason.  Yes, "horribilis" is the Latin root of the English "horrible."  They are much more dangerous then black bears with grizzlies reported to be over 20 times more dangerous than black bears. Any introduction of grizzlies to areas where they do not exist will limit public access and use of those areas.  Public access to grizzly habitat areas is commonly restricted, at least part of the year.  Common recommendations when visiting areas inhabited by grizzlies are to make noise, travel only in groups and don’t travel at night.  Making noise and traveling in groups is contrary to the very purpose of wilderness areas.  The 1964 Wilderness Act declares that wilderness must provide outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.  Many visitors to wilderness areas do so for the solitude and it is not a large step from a recommendation to travel in groups to a requirement that you must travel in groups.  If you have to go in a group to stay safe from the “horrible” bears, you just as well stay in the city. In photography traveling during periods of darkness is often required and very rewarding. Traveling in the darkness is often required for sunsets, sunrises and night sky photos. Yes, you should be very afraid of at least grizzly bears. Delete Buck 7:48 AM Hi Jim, Any two risks can be compared, that is why people can compare the risks of an asteroid impact to the risks of a heart attack. I've lived in Alaska, in grizzly bear country, for decades. For me, and for hundreds of thousands of other people, the risk from grizzlies is "normal." I've had friends die in falls, drowning, airplane crashes, car accidents, in wildfires: many different ways. None from grizzly bear attack. Should I be "very afraid" of flying? Because it's something I spend far less time doing and yet is far more likely to kill me than grizzly bears. A healthy respect for bears is rational and sensible. The vastly inflated level of bear fear many people have is irrational and unhealthy. I agree that any policy of widely expanding the current grizzly bear range should be carefully considered because it is certain to cause increased conflicts of many kinds. Buck Delete Jim Thode 9:26 AM We pretty much agree.  I lived, worked, hiked, hunted and fished in Alaskan grizzly habitat for years and really did not have a lot of concern about them. The restriction of public access to public lands is the largest issue for me. Jim Delete Reply Nicholas S 5:32 AM Buck, thanks for the numbers and for sharing your extensive experience with all of us. I wanted to address Mr. Thode's fear of grizzlies compared to black bears. I invite him and anyone else to inspect Wikipedia's page pertaining to bear fatalities in North America. One can see that black bears are nothing to be fearless or careless around. And statistically, black bears are more likely to be predatory than grizzlies. Bear spray for any territory is what I say! That can also blind aggressive humans if need be. And I carry a gun as well for just-in-case situations. Nick Reply Delete Replies Buck 6:22 AM The problem with only looking at the worst case scenarios (Wikipedia Bear Fatalities) is that it doesn't give a realistic idea of odds. Its numerators without denominators. Accidental gun deaths are orders of magnitude more common than deaths from bears. I think it's fair to say that the risk of mitigation attempts (millions more cans of bear spray and guns being carried) far exceed the risk from bears in most scenarios. Of course, it's a free country! Delete Reply Add comment Load more...

Play dead? Fight back? Climb a tree? Science has the answer    By Rose Eveleth    smithsonian.com   June 20, 2013          Image: Brad Wilke     In Canada, bear mischief has been on the rise for the past few weeks. The Globe and Mail spoke with bear-attack expert Stephern Herrero about it and within his Q&A one thing in particular stuck out: if you play dead during a bear attack, you’re pretty certain to be dead by the end of it. Here’s what he said :   The most tragic one is people playing dead during a predacious attack. Because in that circumstance, the bear just keeps on chewing.   This might surprise you, because a lot of places include “playing dead” as part of their bear attack advice. PBS says you should . ”If the animal makes contact, curl up into a ball on your side, or lie flat on your stomach,” they write. “Try not to panic; remain as quiet as possible until the attack ends.” Mountain Nature says “playing dead in a daytime grizzly encounter tends to reduce the level of injury sustained by most attack victims.” Another advice site says that “even if the bear bites you continue to play dead. Once he realizes that you are not a threat he may leave.”  This is an old idea. In 1806, an explorer wrote of a Native American woman who, when attacked by a bear, dropped to the ground and was still. The bear ran off to attack her husband. Another California pioneer wrote “if the man lies still, with his face down, the bear will usually content himself with biting… for a while about the arms and legs, and will then go off a few steps and watch… the bear will believe him dead, and will soon… go away. But let the man move, and the bear is upon him again; let him fight, and he will be in imminent danger of being torn to pieces.”  But what does the science say about this? Well, the key to understanding Herrero’s advice there is understanding the word “predacious.” Predacious attacks are those in which the bear is actually hunting you, rather than responding defensively. A mother bear defending her cubs is not hunting you, she’s just trying to make you go away.  So if the bear attacking you is in defense mode, playing dead is probably the right thing to do. One study on bear attacks writes that “the bear may swat at or bite the victim, but the if victim can retain the presence of mind to lay still, it is likely that he or she will survive the attack.” A look at the bear attacks in Yellowstone National Park between 1931 and 1984 found that 80 percent of the hikers that fought back against the bears were injured.  Hererro’s own book suggests playing dead during “sudden encounters,” when you and the bear surprise one another and the bear attacks in defense.  But what if the bear is attacking you for real? What should you do then? Pretty much all scientific advice guides agree that if the bear sees you as food, you should fight. “The victim should always fight back in the event of a clear predatory attack, such as being pulled out of a tent, regardless of species,” one study says . Another strategy that Herrero’s book says might work is dropping something as a diversion, like a camera, to distract the bear while you escape.  While we’re on the topic of bears, it turns out that some of the other bear survival tips are also misguided. Many places say to climb a tree, which is often a bad idea since many bears can probably climb that tree faster than you can. Don’t run away either, since bears can run through a forest far faster than you can too. The Yellowstone study says that of all the hikers attacked, 61 percent hikers who were injured tried to run away or climb trees.  In the end, your odds against a 1,500-pound brown bear aren’t great. They’re bigger, stronger and faster than you, and have likely killed far more living beings than you have. The key to not being chewed on alive, slashed to death, or otherwise mauled is to know what kind of situation you’re in and respond calmly and appropriately. A tough task when you’re under attack by a bear.

Mountain  Which Wild Animal is Statistically Most Likely to Attack You?      like       tweet           Tuesday March 22, 2016                Casey Butler   Writer/Surfer  Community           Photo: Matt Draper         You’re on dawn patrol, solo, and the surface of the sea is like glass. Between sets, your feet disappear in the murky water. Suddenly you have that sinking feeling that something down there is watching. But you know that the odds are small, that Jaws effectively vilified the ocean’s most deadly predator and that’s the only reason you’re even considering the possibility of a shark attacking, that the very idea is asinine. That water, though. Come to think of it, didn’t Jaws take place somewhere around here? And how small are the odds, really ?  Sharks take up with wolves, snakes, mountain lions and bears in that part of our brains reserved for worst-case scenarios. In actuality, we’re more likely to be killed by cows than any of them. (Yes, really.)  Gordon Grice, author of The Book of Deadly Animals , says that he thinks our fears of large, toothy creatures are hardwired.  “I’ve seen research showing that humans are better able to spot the shape of a snake in a drawing than other shapes,” he explains. “We are programmed to see that specific shape. People who are good at spotting it have an evolutionary advantage over those who aren’t, because snakebite has historically been a major cause of mortality for humans. (It still is in parts of Asia and Africa.)” Advertisement  “I haven’t seen similar research regarding big mammalian predators, but I believe our response to them is similar,” he continues. “At the same time, we tend not to fear other stimuli even if they’re proven dangerous. [The car] scares almost nobody but kills more Americans than all non-human animals combined. The response that helped hunter-gatherers survive a millennia ago still prevails; more logical responses haven’t had time to get coded into our genes.”  But if you were going to go out in a blaze of beastly glory, which animal would be the most likely to usher in your demise?  Studies have estimated that there are about two million surfers in the U.S. and roughly 20 million of us worldwide. According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), a comprehensive global database of shark encounters, there were 59 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks in the U.S. last year – none of which were fatal.  “Surfers and others participating in board sports were most often (49 percent of cases) involved in 2015 incidents,” reports ISAF. My fairly slapdash (at best) calculations indicate that surfers in the U.S. have about a one in 69,180 chance of being attacked by a shark. George Burgess, Director of the Florida Program for Shark Research and Curator of ISAF, explains why my numbers are off:  “[The] problem is that the two million surfers likely go into the water and spend more time in the water than two million of any other user group. So whatever odds you calculate based solely on surfer proportion will be skewed high because their in-the-water hours per person are so much higher. That said, the activities of surfers [are] probably more provocative than other aquatic recreationists and they [are] often in the water at the wrong times (dawn and dusk).”  All of this is to say nothing of the millions of non-surfing ocean goers. The Florida Museum of Natural History calculates that ocean swimmers have only a one in 11.5 million chance of being attacked by a shark. The odds of simply drowning in the ocean are almost three times greater. Fun fact: Last year, more people died taking selfies than at the jaws of the fearsome fish.  Photo: Taylor Case  If you are one of the 37,323,000 hikers in this country (according to the Outdoor Foundation ), you’re obviously more likely to encounter bears than people who spend zero time in the woods. Black bears are by far the most populous – and the most widespread – with an estimated population of 300,000 (or more) spread across at least 40 of our 50 states. Fortunately, they are also the smallest and most timid of the three North American bears.  World Wildlife Fund estimates that there are as many as 30,000 grizzly bears (aka brown bears) in Western Canada and Alaska, but fewer than 1,000 in other parts of the U.S. The Get Bear Smart Society says that Americans are most likely to come across black bears and grizzlies – though polar bear encounters are also possible in Alaska. There are only 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears worldwide, according to WWF.  In 2014, National Geographic reported that while there is an average of one fatal bear attack each year, the number of mauling incidents has increased, thanks to larger bear and human populations.  Still, “bear attacks are extremely rare,” Bear Smart says. “Although there are thousands of human-bear encounters every year, only a very few result in personal injury. Most bears will actually retreat before you are even aware of their presence.” So as long as you’re not dead set on a bear selfie, you’re probably good.  Hikers and backpackers may also worry about wolf, coyote, and mountain lion attacks, depending on where they’re hiking. “Coyotes and wild wolves aren’t historically much of a threat to humans in North America, but they have killed a few people each,” Grice explains.  There are fewer than 6,000 gray wolves in the lower 48 states, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and they’re concentrated in Minnesota. The coyote population, on the other hand, is booming – so much so that they’re addressed in the University of California’s Integrated Pest Management Program.  “Normally, coyotes are elusive animals that avoid contact with humans,” says the IPM site. “Most active after dusk and before daylight, they are typically seen only at a distance. … Within urban and suburban areas in California, however, some coyotes have adapted to residential neighborhoods, parks, and open spaces, and seemingly have lost their fear of humans.”  According to IPM, there have been more than 160 attacks on humans and/or pets since the ’70s, and though only one was fatal, they are becoming more frequent – especially in Southern California.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that it does not track mountain lion attacks nationally and doesn’t know of any source for national statistics, but the Mountain Lion Foundation says that there are between 20,000 and 40,000 mountain lions (also called cougars or pumas) in the U.S. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife says that there were 15 verified mountain lion attacks on humans in California between 1986 and 2014 – three were fatal. Some sources suggest a national annual average of 14 attacks with fewer than one death per year, but this is tough to verify.

There are 7,000-8,000 venomous snake bites reported annually in the U.S. but thanks to modern medicine, the chances of dying from a snake bite are only one in 50 million, according to the University of Florida’s Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation.  “The animals most likely to kill a human in the U.S. are other humans, domestic dogs, [and] stinging insects, including honey bees,” Grice concludes.  When it comes down to it, our chances of being attacked are dependent on our activity of choice, location, and frequently, our own behavior. Dedicated surfers in Florida probably will see a shark at some point and hikers in cougar country may spot a mountain lion, but here’s the thing: Heart attacks outnumber shark attacks in this country 12,457 to one.

  Bear-Inflicted Injuries & Fatalities                    Bear-Inflicted Human Injuries & Fatalities in Yellowstone        Since 1980, over 100 million people have visited Yellowstone. During this time, 38 people were injured by grizzly bears in the park. For all park visitors combined, the chances of being injured by a grizzly bear are approximately 1 in 2.7 million. The risk is significantly lower for people who don't leave developed areas or roadsides, and higher for anyone hiking in the backcountry.  Type of Recreational Activity: Risk of Grizzly Bear Attack Remain in developed areas, roadsides, and boardwalks: 1 in 25.1 million visits Camp in roadside campgrounds: 1 in 22.8 million overnight stays Camp in the backcountry: 1 in 1.4 million overnight stays Travel in the backcountry: 1 in 232,000 person travel days All park activities combined: 1 in 2.7 million visits  If you plan to hike, learn about the best practices for exploring bear country.  Injuries  Grizzly bear-inflicted injuries to humans in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, and four per year during the 1960s. Grizzly bear-caused human injuries in developed areas then decreased to one injury every two years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Since 1980, there have been only two (0.1/year) grizzly bear-caused human injuries in developed areas, an average of approximately one every 18 years. Over the same time span, there have been 34 human injuries caused by grizzly bears in the backcountry: an average of one per year.  Fatalities  Since Yellowstone was established in 1872, eight people have been killed by bears in the park. More people in the park have died from drowning, burns (after falling into hot springs), and suicide than have been killed by bears. To put it in perspective, the probability of being killed by a bear in the park (8 incidents) is only slightly higher than the probability of being killed by a falling tree (6 incidents), in an avalanche (6 incidents), or being struck and killed by lightning (5 incidents). Here is summary of each fatality:   August 2015 - a day hiker, hiking by himself, was killed by an adult female grizzly bear with two cubs near the Elephant Back Loop Trail in the Lake Village  August 2011 - a day hiker, hiking by himself, was killed by a grizzly bear on the Mary Mountain Trail in Hayden Valley.  July 2011 - a day hiker in a party of two was killed by an adult female grizzly bear with 2 cubs on the Wapiti Lake Trail in Hayden Valley.  October 1986 - a photographer was killed by an adult female grizzly bear near Otter Creek in Hayden Valley.  July 1984 - a grizzly bear killed a backpacker in a backcountry campsite located at the southern end of White Lake near Pelican Valley.  June 1972 - an old adult female grizzly bear killed a man in an illegally established camp. The man surprised the bear when he returned to his campsite at night. The bear was in his camp feeding on food that he had left out unsecured in the campsite.  August 1942 - a bear killed a woman at night in the Old Faithful campground. The species of bear involved was not determined.  1916 - a grizzly bear killed a man in a roadside camp.  A possible fatality supposedly occurred in 1907 when a man was attacked by a female grizzly bear after he prodded her cub with an umbrella. The account of the incident appeared in a popular book, "Book of a Hundred Bears" published in 1909 by F.D. Smith. However, the validity of this incident is questionable as there is no mention of it in official park reports or local newspapers from 1907. The "Book of a Hundred Bears" contains many stories without providing back-up documentation. The 1907 story appears to be an unsubstantiated legend.
