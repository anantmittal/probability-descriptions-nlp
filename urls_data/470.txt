MainPlaceHolderTop      MainPlaceHolder          Most scoliosis occurs at the onset of puberty, around ages 10 to 16 years. This is called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The word “idiopathic” means of unknown cause . Of children and teens in this age group, 2% to 3% will develop scoliosis. There are equal numbers of boys and girls with small curves of less than 10 degrees. However, girls tend to outnumber boys (10 to 1) in curves greater than 30 degrees. Less than 10% of patients diagnosed with scoliosis will require surgery.  This website focuses on idiopathic scoliosis that may require surgery.  Who is at risk for getting a big curve?  There are six main factors that can help predict whether your teen’s curve will increase in size. These factors are related to her growth, whether her bones have stopped growing, and the type and size of her curve.    The younger she is at the time scoliosis is diagnosed, the greater the risk that her curve(s) will increase.   If she has not started menstrual periods yet, there is a greater risk that her curve(s) will increase.   If her bones are still growing at the time scoliosis is diagnosed, there is a greater risk that her curve(s) will increase.   Double (S-shaped) curves are more likely to get bigger than single (C-shaped) curves. This is a general statement as some double curves can be well tolerated as the two curves may “balance each other out”. To see what the different curve patterns look like, go to the next section: What does scoliosis look like.   The larger your teen’s curve(s) when the scoliosis is diagnosed, the greater the risk that her curve(s) will increase.  Boys with similar curves have about one-tenth the chance that the curve(s) will increase when compared to girls.  Osteopenia may increase risk too  There is new research that looks at decreased bone density, called osteopenia, in the hip bone on the opposite side of the curve. Researchers found that patients with osteopenia in the hip were more at risk for having a bigger curve. This is a new area of research so it is not known whether the curve causes the decreased bone density or whether the decreased bone density can cause the curve to get bigger.  It is also not known whether calcium intake in the diet can affect scoliosis in any way.

Viewed from behind though, the spine should appear as a straight line from the base of the neck to the tailbone. Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine.     Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown.  Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that continue to get more severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.  Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis.      Symptoms Signs and symptoms of scoliosis may include:   Uneven shoulders  One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other  Uneven waist  One hip higher than the other   If a scoliosis curve gets worse, the spine will also rotate or twist, in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs on one side of the body to stick out farther than on the other side.  When to see a doctor Go to your doctor if you notice signs or symptoms of scoliosis in your child. Mild curves, however, can develop without the parent or child knowing it because they appear gradually and usually don't cause pain. Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child's scoliosis.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Doctors don't know what causes the most common type of scoliosis — although it appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder tends to run in families. Less common types of scoliosis may be caused by:   Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy  Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine  Injuries to or infections of the spine   Risk factors Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include:   Age. Signs and symptoms typically begin during the growth spurt that occurs just prior to puberty.  Sex. Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment.  Family history. Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don't have a family history of the disease.   Complications While most people with scoliosis have a mild form of the disorder, scoliosis may sometimes cause complications, including:   Lung and heart damage. In severe scoliosis, the rib cage may press against the lungs and heart, making it more difficult to breathe and harder for the heart to pump.  Back problems. Adults who had scoliosis as children are more likely to have chronic back pain than are people in the general population.  Appearance. As scoliosis worsens, it can cause more noticeable changes — including unlevel shoulders, prominent ribs, uneven hips, and a shift of the waist and trunk to the side. Individuals with scoliosis often become self-conscious about their appearance.

Recovery from Scoliosis Surgery  What to expect in the hospital after surgery and how to recover at home      Written by Baron S. Lonner, MD        Email  Print       Recovery from scoliosis surgery will mean some lifestyle changes—but above all, it takes time and patience. Follow these tips for a complication-free recovery, but remember: always listen to your doctor about specific recommendations. These are general guidelines for recovery from scoliosis surgery. At the Hospital: Immediately Following Scoliosis Surgery Pain Management — Just after scoliosis surgery, most patients are given PCA (patient-controlled analgesia). PCA is a pump that delivers morphine or other narcotic at the press of a button by the patient. This controls pain very well for the first two to three days after surgery. Thereafter, PCA is stopped and oral pain medication is administered. At hospital discharge, a prescription for pain medication is provided. Adults may require medication at diminishing doses for weeks or months. Children are usually off medication within two weeks. Drains — A drain prevents fluid accumulation at the incision site and is routine. Most patients have a drain in their back or side for two to three days after surgery. Drains in the side of the chest are termed 'chest tubes' and prevent air and fluid from accumulating around the lungs. Drains are removed when fluid drainage is small. Drain removal is not painful. A urinary catheter (Foley) helps to keep the patient comfortable. It may be removed two or three days after surgery. Walking — Physical therapists and nurses help the patient out of bed on the first or second day after surgery. Walking is guided by the physical therapist and is increased daily as tolerated. Some patients may need a walker or cane early during recovery to help with balance and prevent a fall. keep their balance. Most children do not need walking aids at home. Eating — Most patients will not begin to eat for two to three days after surgery. This is because the bowels slow down after surgery and patients have difficulty keeping food down. Patients start on a diet slowly, first with sips of clear liquids, and move on to solid foods and a regular diet. Once home, it is important to eat well; small frequent meals are best to maintain body weight. Hospital Discharge Before release from the hospital, patients must:  Be eating a regular diet  Urinating normally  Walking, including up and down stairs  Have no fevers  Have minimal drainage at the incision site(s)  Some patients, especially adults, may benefit from a one- to three-week stay at an in-patient rehabilitation facility to improve walking and overall function. At Home: Scoliosis Surgery Recovery Helpful aids include an adjustable bed, shower chair, elevated toilet seat, and extended grasper are for  use at home after surgery. Incision care — Patients may begin to shower one-week after surgery. Before showering, tape plastic wrap to cover the incision. Remove the tape and plastic wrap after each shower. This should be done for showers taken during the first week at home. Thereafter, shower without the plastic wrap covering the incision. For safety, it is important to be accompanied in the shower for the first two to three weeks. If there is a dressing on the incision, change it once a day until there is no staining of the sterile gauze. Thereafter, a dressing is not needed. Steri-Strips are usually placed across the incision(s) and will fall off on their own. Do not remove the Steri-Strips unless instructed to do so or if they are dangling. Respiratory Function — Lung (pulmonary) function may slightly decline after scoliosis surgery. To improve breathing function steadily with time, it is helpful to perform respiratory exercises every one to two hours for the first three weeks after surgery. Respiratory exercises include deep breathing using the incentive spirometer provided at the hospital and frequent coughing. Lung function is routinely checked during regular office visits. Activity Level — Patients are encouraged to walk. However, bending, lifting, and twisting are usually prohibited for several months or until the surgeon approves. Sports are not allowed for at least three months after surgery. When activities are resumed, it is recommended to return gradually. Conditioning exercises such as swimming, bicycling, treadmill, or jogging are a good way to start. Patients need to be aware of and use good body mechanics for the rest of their lives (eg, bending, lifting). After full healing, most patients will not have activity restrictions. However, certain sports activities such as gymnastics may not be practical. Activities that may be prohibited will be discussed by your surgeon and are dependent on the extent of your spinal fusion. Most patients do not feel restricted. Medication — Usually, nonsteroidal medications, such as aspirin, Motrin, and ibuprofen are prohibited. Tylenol can be taken. Birth control pills are stopped prior to surgery as these may increase the risk of blood clot formation during the postoperative period in women. Smoking — Smoking impairs bone from healing and hinders fusion. Patients must be committed to stop smoking two months before surgery and for a minimum of six months after surgery. Of course, it would be better just to give up the habit for a lifetime. Transportation — Avoid frequent car rides and mass transit for six weeks after surgery. Patients can go home from the hospital by car with a pillow behind their back and seatbelt in use.

Posted on  March 16, 2016  by  drstitzel       A sideways-curving spine is the most troubling aspect of scoliosis, but it’s not the real problem. To figure out what actually causes scoliosis, scientists must look beyond the curve.  We now know that spinal curvature stems from a miscommunication between the brain and the muscles that support the spine. The child’s postural control centers fail to tell the muscles how to properly respond to gravity, so instead of growing straight the spine becomes curved. But why aren’t those messages being sent?  It’s a question with which doctors continue to grapple. Is scoliosis genetic? Hereditary? Caused by environmental factors? Most of the time there’s no clear answer, and that’s what makes scoliosis such a difficult condition to treat.  In about 20 percent of cases, the scoliosis causes are obvious; birth defects, bone damage and neuromuscular disorders can all cause spinal curves to form. But they’re a small minority. More than eight in 10 scoliosis cases are idiopathic, which means they have no known cause.  Through decades of research, scientists have been able to piece together a number of observations and findings about adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . But so far those findings have defied any unified theory to explain why one child’s curve progresses rapidly while another’s requires no medical attention at all.  “Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors,” says the National Institute of Health . “Studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth, nervous system abnormalities, or other factors that have not been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Hereditary or Genetic?  Strong evidence suggests that scoliosis runs in families. Nearly a third of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have a family history of the condition, and first-degree relatives of scoliosis patients have an 11 percent chance of developing it themselves.  “It is possible that genetic factors may be involved in specific aspects of scoliosis, including the shape of a scoliosis curve and the risk for curve progression,” said scoliosis specialist Christopher R. Good, M.D., in the Journal of the Spinal Research Foundation . “A number of population studies have documented that scoliosis runs within families and that there is a higher prevalence of scoliosis among relatives of patients with scoliosis than within the general population.”  The numbers do support the theory that scoliosis is hereditary, or passed down from family members — but does that necessarily mean it’s genetic?  To answer that question, it’s important to understand the difference between genetic and hereditary. Most people use them synonymously, and in many cases they are, but there are subtle differences. A trait can be hereditary without being genetic; cultural characteristics, for example, are passed down through families but aren’t connected to genes. And genetic traits aren’t always hereditary. Consider cancer, which arises from mutant genes but in most cases isn’t inherited from one’s parents.  By examining the inheritance patterns of scoliosis, scientists have concluded that the condition is genetic as well as hereditary, but they still haven’t been able to identify which genes are responsible.  “Researchers suspect that many genes are involved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,” says the National Institute of Health. “Some of these genes likely contribute to causing the disorder, while others play a role in determining the severity of spinal curvature and whether the curve is stable or progressive. Although many genes have been studied, few clear and consistent genetic associations with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Environmental in Nature?  When studying what causes scoliosis , hereditary factors can provide a lot of insight — but they also raise as many questions as they answer.  For example, if scoliosis is hereditary, why does it also crop up in children with no family history of the condition? Another oddity researchers have noted is that the condition seems to have variable effects within each generation. A mother with a mild curve might have a daughter with a severe one, or the scoliosis might skip a generation entirely.  Scientists have explained these anomalies by acknowledging that environmental factors probably contribute to differences in scoliosis development , progression and age at detection. Consider that at least 4 percent of scoliosis curves progress to the threshold for surgery, yet only 1 percent of patients have a high genetic risk of severe curvature. If genes are a factor in only 1 percent of cases, environmental factors must account for the severity in the other 3 percent.  But identifying what those factors are is tricky. Studies have ruled out the theory that the curves are caused by specific behaviors such as slouching or carrying a heavy backpack. They’ve also found no link between scoliosis and living in an industrialized area .  Understanding what causes scoliosis is like hitting a moving target. It’s not a fixed deformity but a dynamic process that appears to spring from a combination of different factors. The more we study it, however, the better equipped we become to effectively treat the condition.  Related Posts Physical Therapy for Scoliosis Is Scoliosis Related to Sciatica Pain?

How will this affect my daily life? Am I going to be in lots of pain? Will I need surgery?  Of course, if you're planning to have children at some point in your life, there's another big question that may well pop into your head:  Will my child have scoliosis too?  We at the Scoliosis SOS Clinic are often asked this question by patients who are still learning about their condition. It seems as though a lot of scoliosis sufferers are troubled by the possibility that they might pass on their spinal curvature to their son or daughter, so today we'd like to take a closer look at this issue.  Is scoliosis passed on genetically?  For the purposes of this discussion, we're going to talk exclusively about idiopathic scoliosis , by far the condition's most common form. If your scoliosis is non-idiopathic and arose because of some underlying condition (such as osteoporosis or Marfan syndrome ), you will need to research the underlying condition in order to assess the likelihood that your child will be affected.  Idiopathic scoliosis, by definition, has no known cause, but it seems to occur as a result of genetic factors. However, that absolutely does not mean that idiopathic scoliosis sufferers always bear scoliotic children. Here are some statistics that may put your mind at ease:   Just 1 in 4 scoliosis sufferers (approx.) have at least one other case of scoliosis in their family.  If you are the child or sibling of a scoliosis sufferer, you have roughly an 11% chance of developing the condition yourself.   Bear in mind that lots of other variables still apply here: for example, scoliosis is far more likely to occur in females, so the risk of passing scoliosis on to your child is significantly lower if you're expecting a boy.   How do I check if my child has scoliosis?  Here's how to check your child for signs of scoliosis:   Ask your child to stand in front of you with their back to you. They will need to take off their top so that you can see their back and spine.  Firstly, check to see if both sides of their neck, shoulders, rib cage, waist and hips look even and symmetrical.  Secondly, ask your child to bend forwards from the waist. Look at both sides of their rib cage: does one side appear higher than the other?   Remember, every body is unique, so some minor differences are to be expected - this may not indicate the presence of scoliosis. That being said, if you are concerned, it is a good idea to get your child checked by a medical professional.  If your child develops scoliosis...  Even if your child does develop a spinal curve as they grow, it's important to remember that scoliosis sufferers can live just as well as people with healthy spines. Young scoliosis sufferers should be monitored closely, as medical observation will ensure that treatment can begin right away if and when it becomes necessary. Tackling scoliosis early (i.e. before the curve can progress too far) goes a long way towards limiting the condition's effect on the patient's health and quality of life - watch the video below for a real-life example of this (Lottie, a 12 year-old girl from Surrey).   An exercise-based treatment course that is specifically tailored to scoliosis patients (such as our own ScolioGold method ) can be very effective at combating scoliosis, especially when it is still at an early stage. If you or your child need scoliosis treatment, please feel free to contact Scoliosis SOS  and arrange a consultation with our scoliosis consultants.

Roughly 3 million new cases of the condition are diagnosed in the United States each year, with a majority of them identified as idiopathic scoliosis — a type of scoliosis that presents in children between 10 to 12 years old.  Below, Paul Sponseller, M.D. , pediatric orthopaedic expert and director of the Johns Hopkins Division of Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgery , provides five facts about scoliosis that all parents should know before their child’s next physical.  1. Early diagnosis is key.  It’s important for parents to make sure their children are receiving regular checkups so that conditions like scoliosis can be diagnosed and managed early. “If scoliosis can be diagnosed before the child has a growth spurt,” says Sponseller, “the provider can determine a treatment plan that prevents a bigger curve from forming during times of growth.”  Common signs of scoliosis include uneven shoulders or hips, but it is generally a painless condition that may go unnoticed until a routine exam or physical. “Children around the age of 10 to 12 are usually becoming more private,” Sponseller notes, “and parents are no longer involved in activities like bathing or dressing them, when they may have otherwise noticed a change.”  2. Most cases of scoliosis have no known cause.  Parents: It’s not your fault if your child is diagnosed with scoliosis. “Parents tend to ask what they could have done to prevent scoliosis,” says Sponseller, “but scoliosis is a very interesting disease, because there is currently no known cause or prevention method.”  It’s also very common for parents to ask if bad posture or heavy backpacks could have caused their child’s scoliosis. While these two things may be associated with other spine and back conditions, they do not cause scoliosis, Sponseller says.  3. Scoliosis runs in families.  “When parents hear scoliosis runs in families, they often say, ‘But nobody in our family has it,’” says Sponseller. “But in reality, it’s likely that someone does or did and it went unnoticed because it was a very mild case.” Of course, there are also instances where a child is the first in the family to develop the condition.  4. Only a small percentage of scoliosis patients require treatment.  “I see a number of patients who automatically assume they will need treatment for their scoliosis, but only a small percentage — about 30 percent — require bracing, and an even smaller percent — about 10 percent — of patients actually require surgery,” Sponseller assures.  If your child is diagnosed with scoliosis, Sponseller says not to be scared. “Scoliosis is a very manageable condition when diagnosed early.” For children who are still growing, an external torso brace can be used to prevent further worsening of the scoliosis while the child grows. Even when wearing a brace, most children live normal lives and participate in the same activities as their peers.  5. Surgery, if needed, has good outcomes.  If your child turns out to be among them, Sponseller — who performs over 150 spine surgeries a year — advises parents that while it may be a hard decision to make on behalf of your child, having surgery sooner rather than later is better. When done early, the surgery tends to be simpler, as less of the spine needs to be fused. Perhaps more importantly, he says, is your child being in good overall health and having the support of his or her family during recovery. Parents should also work with their child’s school to determine a plan for the time the child will miss during recovery — usually one to two months.

Posted on  March 16, 2016  by  drstitzel       A sideways-curving spine is the most troubling aspect of scoliosis, but it’s not the real problem. To figure out what actually causes scoliosis, scientists must look beyond the curve.  We now know that spinal curvature stems from a miscommunication between the brain and the muscles that support the spine. The child’s postural control centers fail to tell the muscles how to properly respond to gravity, so instead of growing straight the spine becomes curved. But why aren’t those messages being sent?  It’s a question with which doctors continue to grapple. Is scoliosis genetic? Hereditary? Caused by environmental factors? Most of the time there’s no clear answer, and that’s what makes scoliosis such a difficult condition to treat.  In about 20 percent of cases, the scoliosis causes are obvious; birth defects, bone damage and neuromuscular disorders can all cause spinal curves to form. But they’re a small minority. More than eight in 10 scoliosis cases are idiopathic, which means they have no known cause.  Through decades of research, scientists have been able to piece together a number of observations and findings about adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . But so far those findings have defied any unified theory to explain why one child’s curve progresses rapidly while another’s requires no medical attention at all.  “Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors,” says the National Institute of Health . “Studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth, nervous system abnormalities, or other factors that have not been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Hereditary or Genetic?  Strong evidence suggests that scoliosis runs in families. Nearly a third of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have a family history of the condition, and first-degree relatives of scoliosis patients have an 11 percent chance of developing it themselves.  “It is possible that genetic factors may be involved in specific aspects of scoliosis, including the shape of a scoliosis curve and the risk for curve progression,” said scoliosis specialist Christopher R. Good, M.D., in the Journal of the Spinal Research Foundation . “A number of population studies have documented that scoliosis runs within families and that there is a higher prevalence of scoliosis among relatives of patients with scoliosis than within the general population.”  The numbers do support the theory that scoliosis is hereditary, or passed down from family members — but does that necessarily mean it’s genetic?  To answer that question, it’s important to understand the difference between genetic and hereditary. Most people use them synonymously, and in many cases they are, but there are subtle differences. A trait can be hereditary without being genetic; cultural characteristics, for example, are passed down through families but aren’t connected to genes. And genetic traits aren’t always hereditary. Consider cancer, which arises from mutant genes but in most cases isn’t inherited from one’s parents.  By examining the inheritance patterns of scoliosis, scientists have concluded that the condition is genetic as well as hereditary, but they still haven’t been able to identify which genes are responsible.  “Researchers suspect that many genes are involved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,” says the National Institute of Health. “Some of these genes likely contribute to causing the disorder, while others play a role in determining the severity of spinal curvature and whether the curve is stable or progressive. Although many genes have been studied, few clear and consistent genetic associations with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Environmental in Nature?  When studying what causes scoliosis , hereditary factors can provide a lot of insight — but they also raise as many questions as they answer.  For example, if scoliosis is hereditary, why does it also crop up in children with no family history of the condition? Another oddity researchers have noted is that the condition seems to have variable effects within each generation. A mother with a mild curve might have a daughter with a severe one, or the scoliosis might skip a generation entirely.  Scientists have explained these anomalies by acknowledging that environmental factors probably contribute to differences in scoliosis development , progression and age at detection. Consider that at least 4 percent of scoliosis curves progress to the threshold for surgery, yet only 1 percent of patients have a high genetic risk of severe curvature. If genes are a factor in only 1 percent of cases, environmental factors must account for the severity in the other 3 percent.  But identifying what those factors are is tricky. Studies have ruled out the theory that the curves are caused by specific behaviors such as slouching or carrying a heavy backpack. They’ve also found no link between scoliosis and living in an industrialized area .  Understanding what causes scoliosis is like hitting a moving target. It’s not a fixed deformity but a dynamic process that appears to spring from a combination of different factors. The more we study it, however, the better equipped we become to effectively treat the condition.  Related Posts Physical Therapy for Scoliosis Is Scoliosis Related to Sciatica Pain?

But for women with scoliosis, pregnancy and childbirth are often fraught with anxiety. Many wonder if they even can or should get pregnant.  The reality is that risks are a natural part of pregnancy, whether you have an abnormal spine or not. But just how does the scoliosis affect the entire process, from conception to delivery? Below are answers to some of the most common questions women ask about pregnancy and scoliosis.  Can I get pregnant with scoliosis?  Scoliosis often makes women hesitant to get pregnant. Many fear complications, birth defects or even fertility problems. But decades of research suggest their fears are unfounded.  Scientists have determined scoliosis doesn’t cause any particular complications—pregnancy, labor, deliver or fetal—compared to women without it. It also doesn’t appear to diminish fertility or increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or birth defects. Even women who have had spinal fusion surgery can get pregnant.  “Women who have been successfully treated for scoliosis have only minor or no additional risks at all for complications during pregnancy and delivery,” says the University of Maryland Medical Center. “A history of scoliosis does not endanger the child.”  Will my baby have scoliosis?  No one knows what causes idiopathic scoliosis, but we do know that it can be hereditary. About 30 percent people with scoliosis have family members with the same condition.  Still, having scoliosis doesn’t guarantee that your child will develop it. Only about a third of children whose parents have scoliosis will develop it. The risk can also depend on your baby’s gender, since scoliosis is far more prevalent in girls than in boys.  Will pregnancy cause my curves to progress?  Women with scoliosis often wonder whether pregnancy will make their curvature worse. The good news is that as long as the curve has already stopped progressing , weight gain from pregnancy won’t propel it further.  “Having one or more pregnancies does not appear to affect curve progression in scoliosis,” says orthopedic surgeon and researcher Josh E. Schroeder .  He acknowledges that there is some evidence that among patients who have previously worn a brace, pregnant women “had a higher risk of curve progression compared with never-pregnant women.” But, he adds, “the overall strength of evidence for this conclusion is low.”  Will my scoliosis symptoms get worse during pregnancy?  For women with scoliosis, pregnancy triggers the same symptoms women without scoliosis experience.  For example, nearly all women have mild to moderate back pain at some point during their pregnancy—while half experience lower back pain—so it’s difficult to tell whether the pain stems from the pregnancy or the scoliosis. However, a pre-existing back condition (such as scoliosis) does increase the risk of lower back pain during pregnancy.  Back pain can start as early three months and continue for up to six months after delivery. By the ninth month, the likelihood of lower back pain reaches 50 percent.  Breathlessness is another common symptom pregnant women experience, particularly in the early months. This is due to the rise in progesterone, which increases both respiratory rate and depth. Expectant mothers with scoliosis may experience mildly restricted lung capacity, but they rarely have breathing problems.  Does scoliosis complicate labor?  Once upon a time, doctors automatically scheduled C-sections for women with scoliosis. But as more and more women opt for vaginal delivery, doctors are discovering it can be done successfully—without any unusual complications.  For the most part, delivery is the same for women with and without scoliosis. But there are a few differences, such as:   Expectant mothers with crooked hips can experience “stalls” during labor due to mal-positioning of the baby.  Women weakened by scoliosis may have a harder time pushing during labor.  Scoliosis can make it difficult to receive an epidural, especially for those who have had spinal fusion surgery.   Women who are pregnant with scoliosis should discuss delivery and pain management options with their doctor well before they go into labor.  How can I support my body during pregnancy and delivery?  Your physical condition can make a big difference in the outcome of your delivery. Stretches can help relieve back pain, while strengthening exercises help support the birthing process and improve the baby’s positioning. Regular chiropractic adjustments to keep your spine in alignment can also be beneficial to your baby’s position.  If you have scoliosis and are considering becoming pregnant, there are treatments that can help prepare your body for the process. Through brain-muscle retraining and nutritional support, you can stop scoliosis progression and reduce pain to pave the way for an easier pregnancy.  What if my scoliosis is severe?  In cases of severe scoliosis, getting pregnant can be a bit risker than usual. For example:   Back pain can be significantly worse for women with severe curves.  Breathing problems may occur later in the pregnancy.  Both the baby and the scoliosis curve may need to be closely monitored.   To prevent complications, women with severe scoliosis should consult their doctor before becoming pregnant.  Legions of women with scoliosis have successfully carried and delivered healthy babies. Your doctor can work with you to ensure you’ll be one of them.

Posted on  November 4, 2015  by  drstitzel       A scoliosis diagnosis can be scary, especially when doctors start talking about back braces and spinal fusion surgery. The good news is that informed parents are far more likely to achieve a positive outcome for their children.  It all starts with understanding what scoliosis is — and what it isn’t. Scoliosis is a complex neuromuscular condition that causes the spine to curve. Although most people think of the curve itself as the problem, it’s actually just the symptom of a deeper defect: a neuro-hormonal imbalance that prevents the brain from detecting and correcting the spine’s abnormal posture.  While scoliosis isn’t common, it’s not as rare as you might think. Around 3-5% percent of kids develop some degree of scoliosis during their teenage years. The vast majority of the time, it’s mild and only requires scoliosis specific exercise treatment. About 10 percent of the time, the curves progress enough to require surgical intervention.  Types of Scoliosis  In most cases, doctors don’t know what causes scoliosis. It most commonly arises during adolescence and can’t be attributed to a specific cause. However, there are several other types of scoliosis that can arise during various stages of life, and their origins are less mysterious. Here’s a look at the main types of scoliosis:  Idiopathic. In eight out of 10 scoliosis patients, the specific cause is unknown. Idiopathic scoliosis most commonly develops during adolescence, during periods of rapid growth. While about 80 percent of cases occur between ages 10 and 18, idiopathic scoliosis can be discovered at any age.   Infantile: ages 0 to 3  Juvenile: ages 4 to 9  Adolescent: ages 10 to 18  Adult: older than 18   Functional. With functional scoliosis, the spine itself is normal but is pulled into a curve by the surrounding muscles. This usually occurs because of a defect or imbalance in the patient’s posture. For example, children with one leg longer than the other or adults who engage in repetitive asymmetrical activities (such as tennis or golf) can develop this condition.  Degenerative. While it’s far more common to find scoliosis in kids than in adults, this particular type arises after the age of 40. It’s the result of weakening in the spine due to age-related conditions such as arthritis, bone spurs, osteoporosis and disc degeneration.  Who’s at Risk?  Although most of the time we don’t know what causes scoliosis , scientists have identified several risk factors that increase the odds of developing it. For example, we know that scoliosis affects seven girls for every one boy. Most early cases occur in girls between the ages of 8 and 14 who have not begun menstruating and have thin, lanky bodies.  Genetics also play a role. Around 30 percent of scoliosis patients have a family history of the condition, and while there are many factors involved in the development of scoliosis, genetics account for about 38 percent . This means kids who have siblings, parents or grandparents with the condition should get screened.  Unfortunately, scoliosis is not preventable. Research has ruled out a connection between idiopathic scoliosis and specific behaviors such as poor posture or carrying a heavy backpack.  Stages of Scoliosis  The early signs of scoliosis in children can be difficult to detect. With mild curves, symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked. It’s often not until the curves become severe than the condition begins to cause pain or difficulty moving.  However, alert parents can sometimes spot the early signs of scoliosis:   Uneven hemline, pant legs or shirt sleeves  Abnormal posture, such as tilted shoulders, rib cage or hips  Tilted eye line  Unexplained back pain  Low vitamin D levels  Fatigue after long periods of sitting or standing  Body that leans to one side  Slight limp or one leg that appears longer than the other  Ribs that stick out during a full forward bend   To catch more cases before they become severe, many schools and pediatricians screen for scoliosis in children at the fifth- or sixth-grade level. The Scoliosis Research Society, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons all recommend that girls get screened twice at ages 10 and 12 and boys get screened once at age 13 or 14.  Screenings typically involve a using forward bend test to look for abnormalities in the spine and posture. If visible symptoms are found, the next step is to see a doctor for diagnosis, which typically requires an x-ray.  The recommended treatment depends on the size of the curve, which is used to determine what stage the scoliosis is in. While not all scoliosis cases will continue to advance, the odds of progression increase dramatically as the curve grows.  0-10 degrees: No scoliosis is detected.  10-25 degrees: At this stage, scoliosis is considered mild. Doctors will often recommend observation of small curves to determine how quickly they’re worsening. But the wait-and-see method has its risks. Below 19 degrees, there’s only a 22 percent chance the curves will continue to progress, but once the spinal curve reaches 20 degrees, the likelihood of progression jumps to 68 percent. Early intervention such as ScoliSMART’s Small Curve Camp can stop scoliosis before it reaches this threshold, while reducing existing curvature.  25-40 degrees: If the child’s spine is still growing when the curve reaches 25 degrees, many doctors will recommend bracing to slow or prevent further progression — despite growing evidence that bracing doesn’t work. Alternative therapies have had much greater success at halting scoliosis. For example, the Scoliosis Activity Suit combines active resistance exercises with other treatments to achieve a 90 percent success rate at stabilizing or reducing spinal curves. It’s important to start using such treatments as early as possible, because once the curvature reaches 30 degrees, the odds of progression leap to 90 percent.  50+ degrees: At 50 degrees, most spinal surgeons will recommend spinal fusion surgery in an attempt to reduce the curve and prevent further progression. However, this high-risk surgery can have devastating side effects and rarely leads to a positive outcome. Fortunately, there are many non-surgical scoliosis treatment options that can help support and strengthen the spine without fusing its bones together. It’s important to research all of the options so you can make an informed decision for your child.  Because early detection has such a big impact on treatment outcomes, it’s wise to have your child screened if you suspect scoliosis. If you recently received a diagnosis, it’s never too early to start looking into non-surgical scoliosis treatment options.

Is anyone aware of any studies on the likelihood of passing on these genetics?  My curvatures were at 59 and 68 degrees before surgery, so I know Im in the extreme case category.  Does this further increase the chances for my kids?  LindaRacine 08-11-2004, 05:13 PM Hi Stacie...  As far as I know, there are still no statistics on the probability of passing along idiopathic scoliosis to your offspring.  There are studies in progress, so hopefully we'll know some day soon.  Although I know a lot of people who have scoliosis in their family, I know a lot more who don't.  I'm one of 8 siblings, and the only one with scoliosis.  The only thing that I would recommend is that you have your kids checked by their pediatrician on a yearly basis.  Regards, Linda  DaveWolpert 08-12-2004, 10:42 AM I do think it's safe to say that there is at least a slightly higher statistical probability that your children will develop scoliosis. Scoliosis does tend to run in families, so there must be some genetic component to the spread of the disorder. Linda is right, though, that its inheritance is unpredictable and inconsistent.  There is no obvious genetic link to the severity of the curvatures. I have moderately severe scoliosis, while my sister and one of my cousins, for example, both have very mild 10-15 degree curvatures. These curves weren't even noticed by them or their doctors until carefully checked after I was diagnosed with a progressive curve. Mild kyphosis also runs in my family, though I don't have it. You really can never know.  Dave  Danite 08-18-2004, 12:04 PM Good afternoon, I did go through a very intensive Genetic research after having a daughter with a very similar deformity that was conducted by the University of Michigan Hospital in 1982 and the odds for me to have a child with a genetic deformity (Spinal) was actually below the normal or average percentile.  I do have a congenital birth defect and the first spinal fusion in the state of Michigan in 1954, it is severe and rotoscoliosis with spinal stenosis...etc. In 1984 my wife gave birth to our other daughter and she is completely free of any congenital spinal disorder, praise God.  It is very scary to be in this position,  I understand how you must feel.  At 54 years old, I can no longer work full-time or do normal life activities without some form of accomodation.  But I am very happy and glad to have two wonderful and beautiful daughters, for your information.  The one with the scoliosis does have a rod and is working full-time at the age of twenty-two. Never say never...  spincon58 08-19-2004, 11:39 PM Hi,  Somehow I passed scoliosis to 3 of my children..my daughter 23 has a 26 degree, my son 21 has 14 degree and my daughter 12 has a 19 which still needs to be monitored...so I think I gave it to them....  LindaRacine 08-20-2004, 11:30 AM Hi Connie...  If you haven't already done so, I'd like to urge you to contact Carol Wise at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital.  She's conducting research into the genetics of scoliosis, and was specifically looking for families where at least 4 members are affected.  I don't know if she's still looking, but it might be worthwhile for you to make contact.  I have 2 phone numbers for her: (214)559-7881 and (214)648-1677.  Regards, Linda  Danite 08-20-2004, 12:04 PM I must add, that no matter what any genetic research professional discover, I will always wonder if some how it was pass by genetics.  As I have said, my back is behind me, my disability is second and I'm a person first.  stees 08-22-2004, 09:49 PM Stacie,  Another interesting consideration;  research on and treatment for scoliosis is far advanced from what it was like when I was growing up, and even 15 years ago.  Even 5 years ago.  It may be that it is not such a problem as it was.  :)  stella 09-14-2004, 02:28 AM my daughter doctor told me that if she ever has children they have to be cheked for scoliosis. stella,  Danite 09-14-2004, 11:19 AM Hi Stella,  It is true, but remember all children and even adults today are checked for Scoliosis, if discovered at an early age sometimes surgery can be avoided which is the best option.  My daughters will have children someday (I hope) and they too will be checked for scoliosis, remember the disability does not make the person, we are individuals first and the disability is second. I do not blame myself or my grandparents for the scoliosis but the condition of the environment and the way we live today is what I believe causes a lot of our deseases or illnesses.  I pray and work so that someday in my children time, that people are judge by their abilities not disabilities.  That all individuals with disabilities will understand that they are people first, and they can control their future.  We all have barriers, or hardles that we must jump in our life, some of us have higher hardles, but we can do it.  Never say never, and always fight for your rights, we our not second citizens but equals in this world.  Ms. Scarlett 10-20-2004, 02:46 PM I've read recently that Scoliosis is passed on through every third generation but don't hold any faith in that because all the women in my mothers' family had Kyphosis and I have major Scoliosis.  Not sure where on the internet I read that.  On the other hand, I have two daughters 18 and 22 years of age and a son 20 years old and none of them have any spinal deformaties.  Make sure that if you have young children your family physician checks their spine every time they go to see him/her.  Danite 10-21-2004, 11:46 AM I too heard that it skips generations, I pray that it stops with me and does not continue in my family.  From my point of view, it is not the scoliosis or surgery that makes our life difficult.  It is the views and acceptance of others that make it an issue that turns it in to a psychological game.  Even the medical model itself does what it can to promote such views that we are second citizens, all this does is promote denial, and plays mental games on us.  We do not need to look very far, employment, sports, and even politics has a difficult time in accepting people with disabilities.  Not too mention our own parents sometimes can not accept us as individuals or they blame themselves.  Sorry about venting again, it is just one of those things...God Bless.  Mary Lou 10-21-2004, 12:55 PM I wish there was more research into the hereditary part of Scoliosis.  My 13 year old daughter has Kyphoscoliosis and as far as we can tell, she is the only one in either side of the family with Kyphosis or Scoliosis.  Her doctor says her Kyphosis is most likely caused by Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease/disorder.  There are atleast four generations in her father's side of the family who are effected with CMT to some degree and none of them even heard of the Kyphosis/Scoliosis/CMT connection until I discovered it by mistake while doing my own research.  My personal way of helping find answers that we are all looking for is to donate to Scoliosis research.  I have no connection to the research organization other than I hope they can offer more information to us as a group.  Mary Lou  Danite 10-21-2004, 01:41 PM Oh I forgot to mention that we did go through a genetic research program at University of Michigan when our daughter was born and they said it was very unlikely that it was genetic.  Our daughter was born with severe scoliosis and received her surgery at the age of thirteen.  But determined it was a total different desease, at the same time I can not help but wonder because of my own disability.  They said that we had less then a 1% chance of having another child with scoliosis, and we did have another daughter after one year of trying and she did not have scoliosis, praise God.  So never say never.  gotleyd 10-21-2004, 02:48 PM Hello, I unfortunately have scoliosis because my mother has it. I'm the middle child of three and am the only one who has it. She doesn't have it as bad as I do. It doesn't bother her or progressed but I'm in constant pain and am considering surgery. I have a 15 month old son and I worry that he will get it but  I will have to wait and make sure that something is done for him sooner if he does have it so he won't go through all this when he's my age. I'm 26. His doctor says they don't check for scoliosis until he's 8. That was my first question on his first visit. If you are going to have children or are pregnant discusing it with your doc would be a good idea. Leyda:) :)  Ms. Scarlett 10-22-2004, 11:01 AM Well, as mentioned before, none of my children have it but my mother and her sisters all have it and I have it.  My sisters and brothers do not have it - I'm the only one.   It would be interesting to find out how the gene skipped going to my children.  Now, my son on the other hand has severe psoriasis - worst case his skin specialist has ever seen - his father has it too - very sad to see him when he breaks out.  He's been in a 2 year study where he has had to try different medications and self inject a drug to either eliminate the disease or make it lie dormant - when the study ended he blossomed again like crazy.  He was taking a drug that is given to people who have had transplant surgery - this was to boost the immune system.  He is now being considered for gene therapy - he's only 20 and has suffered with this for 7 years.  I'm wondering if gene therapy would be an option for those who have a history of scoliosis or other genetic conditions like it BEFORE they decide to conceive children.  Wouldn't mind looking into that one.  Ms. Scarlett 10-22-2004, 11:21 AM Just a few comments on the term "Disability"  C.P.P.'s criteria:  * be under 65 * have contributed to the CPP for a minimum number of years * have a "severe and prolonged" disability that prevents him or her from working at any job on a regular basis  First of all, what is determined by the government to be "Severe" and "Prolonged"?  In Canada, having scoliosis and having extensive surgery to correct scoliosis may not put you in the catagory as having a disability.  I have been out of work since April 2003 and have been trying to get a disability pension.  The Federal Canada Pension Plan denied me disabilty benefits because I am able to use a computer and have a post secondary education - meaning - I can type and talk.  This decision was made by a person who was an RN who had never seen me, never spoke to me and merely was going by my medical history and employment history.  There were only minimal medical reports available for her review at the time the decision was made.  I have appealed the decision and go before a Tribunal Board in December of this year - it has been a long long time.  Two weeks ago I receive approval from the Provincial government who deemed me as being disabled.  I made my application to them in February of this year and was approved on October 6th, 2004.  I did not speak to anyone at all nor did I receive mail from them.  I called their office to inquire about the status of my file on October 6th and they told me that they had just made the decision that day - and said that I was officially disabled.  Regardless of what the Provincial Government says, the Federal Government can still refuse my disability benefits - this is because the back problems people have vary from person to person and often times they cannot be physically seen by the naked eye.  I have been amazed by who they grant disability benefits to and have recently found that someone I know who has been diagnosed as being Bi Polar is on permanent disability through the Canada Pension Plan (she's 20 years old) - I have medical documentation which they also have in their possession which has that very same diagnosis and I'm STILL not deemed as being disabled in their eyes - they told me "Everyone gets depressed..."  I couldn't believe it.  Very very unusual system here - I can only hope for the best at my hearing.  Has anyone else had difficulty getting their benefits after surgery??

Smith, MD  Despite a tremendous amount of scientific research, the causes of some types of scoliosis remain largely unknown. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may be a disease that is inherited as a genetic trait, much like some other diseases, such as sickle cell anemia. The gene that causes scoliosis remains undiscovered, but scientists are trying to find this gene using new techniques for analyzing genetic inheritance. Defining the role of genetics in scoliosis is currently the focus of intense research at a number of academic centers throughout the world.  There is strong evidence that an abnormal gene is partially responsible for some forms of scoliosis. It is possible that genetic factors may influence important aspects of scoliosis such as the pattern of curvature (left versus right curves), the shape of the curve, and the risk of progression. The tendency for scoliosis to appear in people who are closely related, such as mothers and their daughters, identical twins, and first degree relatives, suggests that scoliosis can be inherited. For example, several studies have shown that the incidence of scoliosis in first degree relatives (such as parents, siblings, and children) ranges from 7-11%. In contrast, the incidence in second-degree relatives drops to less than 4%. The exact pattern of inheritance remains unknown, and the gene that is responsible for scoliosis has yet to be identified.  One research project that is attempting to find the gene responsible for scoliosis is currently being conducted at Primary Children's Medical Center and the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. This research is being conducted in collaboration with EmerGen, a gene discovery company that is also based in Salt Lake City. We are planning to analyze the patterns of inheritance of scoliosis in families where multiple family members are affected by scoliosis. This type of research has been successful in identifying the causes of other diseases, such as arthrogryposis, a condition that causes stiff joints and limb abnormalities in children. If you are part of a family in which many of your family members have scoliosis and you are interested in participating in this study, please let us know.  Scoliosis and Genetics FAQs  How can I tell if my family has a genetic tendency towards scoliosis? Ask other members of your family. Although about 2% of the general population may have mild scoliosis, a much smaller number have scoliosis significant enough to require treatment with a brace or surgery. Significant scoliosis is often present in 7-10 % of first degree relatives (mothers, daughters, children). If you are interested in this, try a survey of all of your family members at a family reunion or holiday event.  Is there a test for the scoliosis gene? No. The gene or genes for scoliosis has not been identified. When these genes are discovered, it may be possible to develop a test for it.  If I have scoliosis, what are the chances that my children will have scoliosis? Most studies have shown a mother with significant scoliosis runs the risk of having a daughter develop scoliosis approximately 5-10 % of the time. If you have scoliosis and have teenage girls, then it would be a good idea to look at their back during their adolescent growth spurt. This is a time where girls are very modest and it can be hard to tell if they are developing a curve unless you look very closely. The iscoliosis.com self-assessment tool can be very helpful if you are unsure.  What is "gene therapy"? Does gene therapy exist for scoliosis? The concept of gene therapy is that an abnormal gene can be repaired or replaced in the genetic code and then the gene will then function normally. At the present time, the gene or genes for scoliosis have not been found. The technology for genetic engineering is rapidly advancing and the medical community has great hopes for the possibility of the genetic treatment of diseases. Although scientists have the ability to clone sheep in the laboratory, the application of gene therapy for humans is still in the future. Currently, there are no possibilities for gene therapy as a treatment for scoliosis.  Are there any studies being conducted in your region about the genetics of scoliosis? If so, how could I participate? Yes. We are currently conducting a study of the genetics of scoliosis at Primary Children's Medical Center and the University of Utah. This is a collaborative effort with EmerGen, a gene discovery company in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: Review and Current Concepts   BRIAN V. REAMY, LT COL, USAF, MC, Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland JOSEPH B.

Related Editorial Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Article Sections Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is present in 2 to 4 percent of children between 10 and 16 years of age. It is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees accompanied by vertebral rotation. It is thought to be a multigene dominant condition with variable phenotypic expression. Scoliosis can be identified by the Adam's forward bend test during physical examination. Severe pain, a left thoracic curve or an abnormal neurologic examination are red flags that point to a secondary cause for spinal deformity. Specialty consultation and magnetic resonance imaging are needed if red flags are present. Of adolescents diagnosed with scoliosis, only 10 percent have curves that progress and require medical intervention. The main risk factors for curve progression are a large curve magnitude, skeletal immaturity and female gender. The likelihood of curve progression can be estimated by measuring the curve magnitude using the Cobb method on radiographs and by assessing skeletal growth potential using Tanner staging and Risser grading. Recent research has led to a better understanding of the natural history of scoliosis. However, the optimal strategy for screening, diagnosing and treating this common spinal deformity remains controversial. Of adolescents diagnosed with scoliosis, only 10 percent have curve progression requiring medical intervention. 1 The ability to estimate which curves require therapy has led to more appropriate treatment with observation, bracing or surgery. Family physicians need to differentiate patients with stable or minimally progressive scoliosis who can be observed from patients with scoliosis that is at high risk for progression. They need to determine the patients they can follow and those who need referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Unnecessary referrals of adolescents with minimal scoliosis who are at low risk for progression can cause marked anxiety and lost time from school and work, and lead to unnecessary radiation exposure. 2 Delayed referrals of patients with high-risk curves can lead to increased morbidity. In either situation, the psychologic and social effects of this disease can be profound. 2 This article describes an approach to diagnosing and treating scoliosis that allows physicians to lessen the adverse psychologic, medical and economic effects of over-referral or delayed referral of adolescents to orthopedic subspecialists. Classification Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References The Scoliosis Research Society has defined scoliosis as a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees as measured using the Cobb method on a standing radiograph. 3 Idiopathic scoliosis is a structural curve with no clear underlying cause. Secondary causes for scoliosis can usually be identified by radiography and clinical examination ( Table 1 ) . Idiopathic scoliosis is classified based on the age of the patient when it is first identified. Infantile scoliosis has an onset before three years of age. The infantile form accounts for fewer than 1 percent of all cases. Juvenile scoliosis is first detected between three and 10 years of age. The juvenile form occurs in 12 to 21 percent of all patients with idiopathic scoliosis. 4 Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is found between age 10 and skeletal maturity. 4 The adolescent form accounts for the majority of cases of idiopathic scoliosis. Prevalence Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Scoliosis is present in 2 to 4 percent of children between 10and 16yearsofage. 5 The ratio of girls to boys with small curves of 10 degrees is equal but increases to a ratio of 10 girls for every one boy with curves greater than 30 degrees. 5 Scoliosis in girls tends to progress more often and, therefore, girls more commonly need treatment than boys. 5 The prevalence of curves greater than 30 degrees is approximately 0.2 percent, and the prevalence for curves greater than 40 degrees is approximately 0.1 percent. 1 Improved understanding of the natural history and prognosis of this disease can help the physician predict the patients with scoliosis who need treatment.

Natural History/Prognosis Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Once a diagnosis of scoliosis has been made, the primary concerns are whether there is an underlying cause and if the curve will progress. The three main determinants of progression are patient gender, future growth potential and the curve magnitude at the time of diagnosis. 1 In all cases, females have a risk of curve progression 10 times higher than males. 1 The greater the growth potential and the larger the curve, the greater the likelihood of curve progression. Evaluation of growth potential is done by assessing the Tanner stage and the Risser grade. Tanner stage 2 to 3 occurs just after the onset of the pubertal growth spurt and is the time of maximum progression of scoliosis. 6 The Risser grade (zero to 5) gives a useful estimate of how much skeletal growth remains by grading the progress of bony fusion of the iliac apophysis. The iliac apophysis ossifies in a predictable fashion from anterolateral to posteromedial along the iliac crest. Risser grades are as follows: grade zero signifies no ossification, grade 1 signifies up to 25 percent ossification, grade 2 signifies 26 to 50 percent ossification, grade 3 signifies 51 to 75 percent ossification, grade 4 signifies 76 up to 100 percent ossification and grade 5 signifies complete bony fusion of the apophysis 7 ( Figure 1 ) . In one study, 8 the Risser grade was directly correlated with the risk of curve progression. View/Print Figure FIGURE 1. Risser grades zero to 5. Grading is based on the degree of bony fusion of the iliac apophysis, from grade zero (no ossification) to grade 5 (complete bony fusion). FIGURE 1. Risser grades zero to 5. Grading is based on the degree of bony fusion of the iliac apophysis, from grade zero (no ossification) to grade 5 (complete bony fusion). The magnitude of the curve is best determined by measurement of the Cobb angle, which is derived from a standard posteroanterior standing radiograph of the spine. The Cobb angle is the angle formed by a line drawn perpendicular to the top of the superior vertebrae of the scoliotic curve and a similar perpendicular line drawn along the bottom of the inferior vertebrae ( Figure 2 ) . View/Print Figure FIGURE 2. The Cobb method of measuring the degree of scoliosis. The physician chooses the most tilted vertebrae above and below the apex of the curve. The angle between intersecting lines drawn perpendicular to the top of the superior vertebrae and the bottom of the inferior vertebrae is the Cobb angle (here, 62 degrees). FIGURE 2. The Cobb method of measuring the degree of scoliosis. The physician chooses the most tilted vertebrae above and below the apex of the curve. The angle between intersecting lines drawn perpendicular to the top of the superior vertebrae and the bottom of the inferior vertebrae is the Cobb angle (here, 62 degrees). The risk of curve progression can be estimated by taking into account the patient's sex, time of menarche and growth potential (Tanner stage and Risser grade), and the magnitude of the curve. This is key information to help with decisions about the need for referral to an orthopedic surgeon and, in those who are not referred, about examination frequency for curves at lower risk of progression. It is important to remember that this information does not conclusively determine whether a specific curve will progress, only the general risk of a curve progressing. Table 2 summarizes the results of multiple studies done to assist in predicting the risk of curve progression in adolescents; the table can also assist in patient counseling. 5, 8– 11 View/Print Table TABLE 2 Risk of Curve Progression Curve (degree) Growth potential (Risser grade) Risk* 10 to 19 Limited (2 to 4) Low 10 to 19 High (0 to 1) Moderate 20 to 29 Limited (2 to 4) Low/moderate 20 to 29 High (0 to 1) High >29 Limited (2 to 4) High >29 High (0 to 1) Very high *— Low risk = 5 to 15 percent; moderate risk = 15 to 40 percent; high risk = 40 to 70 percent; very high risk = 70 to 90 percent .

Information from references 5 and 8 through 11 . The risk that an untreated adolescent with scoliosis will have a curve progress into adulthood has been determined. Curves less than 30 degrees at bone maturity are unlikely to progress, whereas curves measuring from 30 to 50 degrees progress an average of 10 to 15 degrees over a lifetime. Curves greater than 50 degrees at maturity progress steadily at a rate of 1 degree per year. 1 In most patients, life-threatening effects on pulmonary function do not occur until the scoliotic curve is 100 degrees or greater. 1 Of equal significance is the fact that significant psychologic illness has been found in up to 19 percent of females who have curves greater than 40 degrees as adults. 2 Social isolation, limited job opportunities and lower marriage rates are possible consequences. Pathophysiology Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Many studies have attempted to uncover the pathophysiologic process underlying idiopathic scoliosis. Multiple abnormalities have been found, yet none has been conclusively linked to all cases. Studies of twins 12 have given the firmest indication that the most significant factor is genetic. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis 13 showed that not only is the risk for scoliosis greater in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins, the rate of curve progression is nearly identical among twins subjected to a variety of environmental influences. Current theorists believe that scoliosis is a multigene dominant condition with variable phenotypic expression. 5 Therefore, even though scoliosis is typically present in most members of the same family, its severity can vary widely from parent to child and sibling to sibling. When both parents have scoliosis, the risk that their children will require treatment is 50 times that in the general population. 7 Screening Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Screening for scoliosis was common in schools and communities in past years. Over-referral of adolescents with insignificant curves led to a marked decrease in many such programs. Recent studies have demonstrated that over-referral is common even when multiple diagnostic modalities are used. 14 , 15 The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends screening girls at ages 11 and 13, and screening boys once at age 13 or 14 years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended scoliosis screening with the Adam's forward bending test at routine health visits at 10, 12,14 and 16 years of age, although evidence does not exist to support these recommendations. 2 In 1996, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released its opinion on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The Task Force noted that “there is insufficient evidence for or against routine screening of asymptomatic adolescents for idiopathic scoliosis. Clinicians should remain alert for large spinal curvatures when examining adolescents.” 2 HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. The history and physical examination are intended to exclude secondary causes for the spinal deformity. The patient should be asked about a family history of scoliosis, menstrual onset, and the presence of pain and neurologic changes, including bowel and bladder dysfunction. The presence of severe pain or neurologic symptoms would be atypical for idiopathic scoliosis. The physical examination should include an assessment of Tanner stage and a complete neurologic examination. Peak curve progression occurs during Tanner stage 2 or 3. Any abnormal neurologic findings should raise concern for spinal cord pathology. Although there is no ideal screening test, the Adam's forward bend test requires no additional equipment (such as a scoliometer or humpometer) and can help to identify scoliosis. 5 The child bends forward at the waist until the spine becomes parallel to the horizontal plane, while holding palms together with arms extended. The examiner looks along the horizontal plane of the spine from the back and side to detect an asymmetry in the contour of the back known as a “rib hump” ( Figure 3 ) . A rib hump is a hallmark of scoliotic curves greater than 10 degrees and should prompt radiographic evaluation. The direction of curves in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is remarkably consistent. Ninety percent of thoracic curves are to the right. 16 Therefore, left thoracic curves should raise a red flag and prompt more extensive evaluation. Additional red flags include markedly painful scoliosis, untoward stiffness, deviation to one side during the forward bend test, sudden rapid progression in a previously stable curve, extensive progression in a patient after skeletal maturity, abnormal neurologic findings and the stigmata of other clinical syndromes associated with spinal curvature. 5, 16, 17 Radiography and Additional Tests Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Abnormalities on physical examination require radiographic evaluation with a single standing posteroanterior radiograph to allow measurement of the curve using the Cobb method and Risser grading of the iliac apophysis. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated whenever there is a left thoracic curve, unusual pain or abnormalities on neurologic examination, or other red flags, to evaluate for spondylolisthesis, tumors or syringomyelia. 18 Referral Guidelines and Treatment Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Treatment options for patients with scoliosis range from the unproven or harmful to the beneficial. Physical therapy, chiropractic care, biofeedback and electric stimulation have not been shown to alter the natural history of scoliosis. 2, 7, 12 In contrast, bracing and spinal surgery have been proved to alter the natural history of curve progression. Bracing techniques have also improved markedly; braces are more comfortable and better tolerated than in the past, when studies had shown that adolescents wore their braces only 65 percent of the time they were intended to use them. 19 In addition, most modern braces are of the underarm thoracolumbar-sacral orthosis type, which can be worn under the clothing. A recent study showed that bracing had a 74 percent success rate at halting curve progression. 20 It is important to counsel adolescents and their parents that bracing does not correct scoliosis but may prevent significant progression of the spinal curvature. Orthosis use is usually continued until the patient reaches Risser grade 4 or 5. 5 Spinal surgery with instrumentation corrects a significant part of the deformity and hopefully stops further progression of the scoliotic curve. Current consensus is that surgery should be performed for curves greater than 40 to 45 degrees when there is growth remaining. 5 , 21 Many implants are available to provide excellent stability and strong corrective forces to the spinal column. 22 Modern surgery is accompanied by spinal cord monitoring using somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials, thereby decreasing the rate of neurologic injury to one in 7,000 procedures. 5 View/Print Figure FIGURE 3.

Adolescent scoliosis can be followed by the family physician if the curve has a low risk of progression and an underlying cause has been excluded. Curves that demonstrate progression in patients with continued growth remaining and curves with a high risk of progression should be referred to an orthopedic subspecialist. Referral is always indicated when red flags are present on physical or radiographic examination.

MainPlaceHolderTop      MainPlaceHolder          Most scoliosis occurs at the onset of puberty, around ages 10 to 16 years. This is called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The word “idiopathic” means of unknown cause . Of children and teens in this age group, 2% to 3% will develop scoliosis. There are equal numbers of boys and girls with small curves of less than 10 degrees. However, girls tend to outnumber boys (10 to 1) in curves greater than 30 degrees. Less than 10% of patients diagnosed with scoliosis will require surgery.  This website focuses on idiopathic scoliosis that may require surgery.  Who is at risk for getting a big curve?  There are six main factors that can help predict whether your teen’s curve will increase in size. These factors are related to her growth, whether her bones have stopped growing, and the type and size of her curve.    The younger she is at the time scoliosis is diagnosed, the greater the risk that her curve(s) will increase.   If she has not started menstrual periods yet, there is a greater risk that her curve(s) will increase.   If her bones are still growing at the time scoliosis is diagnosed, there is a greater risk that her curve(s) will increase.   Double (S-shaped) curves are more likely to get bigger than single (C-shaped) curves. This is a general statement as some double curves can be well tolerated as the two curves may “balance each other out”. To see what the different curve patterns look like, go to the next section: What does scoliosis look like.   The larger your teen’s curve(s) when the scoliosis is diagnosed, the greater the risk that her curve(s) will increase.  Boys with similar curves have about one-tenth the chance that the curve(s) will increase when compared to girls.  Osteopenia may increase risk too  There is new research that looks at decreased bone density, called osteopenia, in the hip bone on the opposite side of the curve. Researchers found that patients with osteopenia in the hip were more at risk for having a bigger curve. This is a new area of research so it is not known whether the curve causes the decreased bone density or whether the decreased bone density can cause the curve to get bigger.  It is also not known whether calcium intake in the diet can affect scoliosis in any way.

Viewed from behind though, the spine should appear as a straight line from the base of the neck to the tailbone. Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine.     Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown.  Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that continue to get more severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.  Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis.      Symptoms Signs and symptoms of scoliosis may include:   Uneven shoulders  One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other  Uneven waist  One hip higher than the other   If a scoliosis curve gets worse, the spine will also rotate or twist, in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs on one side of the body to stick out farther than on the other side.  When to see a doctor Go to your doctor if you notice signs or symptoms of scoliosis in your child. Mild curves, however, can develop without the parent or child knowing it because they appear gradually and usually don't cause pain. Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child's scoliosis.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Doctors don't know what causes the most common type of scoliosis — although it appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder tends to run in families. Less common types of scoliosis may be caused by:   Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy  Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine  Injuries to or infections of the spine   Risk factors Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include:   Age. Signs and symptoms typically begin during the growth spurt that occurs just prior to puberty.  Sex. Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment.  Family history. Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don't have a family history of the disease.   Complications While most people with scoliosis have a mild form of the disorder, scoliosis may sometimes cause complications, including:   Lung and heart damage. In severe scoliosis, the rib cage may press against the lungs and heart, making it more difficult to breathe and harder for the heart to pump.  Back problems. Adults who had scoliosis as children are more likely to have chronic back pain than are people in the general population.  Appearance. As scoliosis worsens, it can cause more noticeable changes — including unlevel shoulders, prominent ribs, uneven hips, and a shift of the waist and trunk to the side. Individuals with scoliosis often become self-conscious about their appearance.

Recovery from Scoliosis Surgery  What to expect in the hospital after surgery and how to recover at home      Written by Baron S. Lonner, MD        Email  Print       Recovery from scoliosis surgery will mean some lifestyle changes—but above all, it takes time and patience. Follow these tips for a complication-free recovery, but remember: always listen to your doctor about specific recommendations. These are general guidelines for recovery from scoliosis surgery. At the Hospital: Immediately Following Scoliosis Surgery Pain Management — Just after scoliosis surgery, most patients are given PCA (patient-controlled analgesia). PCA is a pump that delivers morphine or other narcotic at the press of a button by the patient. This controls pain very well for the first two to three days after surgery. Thereafter, PCA is stopped and oral pain medication is administered. At hospital discharge, a prescription for pain medication is provided. Adults may require medication at diminishing doses for weeks or months. Children are usually off medication within two weeks. Drains — A drain prevents fluid accumulation at the incision site and is routine. Most patients have a drain in their back or side for two to three days after surgery. Drains in the side of the chest are termed 'chest tubes' and prevent air and fluid from accumulating around the lungs. Drains are removed when fluid drainage is small. Drain removal is not painful. A urinary catheter (Foley) helps to keep the patient comfortable. It may be removed two or three days after surgery. Walking — Physical therapists and nurses help the patient out of bed on the first or second day after surgery. Walking is guided by the physical therapist and is increased daily as tolerated. Some patients may need a walker or cane early during recovery to help with balance and prevent a fall. keep their balance. Most children do not need walking aids at home. Eating — Most patients will not begin to eat for two to three days after surgery. This is because the bowels slow down after surgery and patients have difficulty keeping food down. Patients start on a diet slowly, first with sips of clear liquids, and move on to solid foods and a regular diet. Once home, it is important to eat well; small frequent meals are best to maintain body weight. Hospital Discharge Before release from the hospital, patients must:  Be eating a regular diet  Urinating normally  Walking, including up and down stairs  Have no fevers  Have minimal drainage at the incision site(s)  Some patients, especially adults, may benefit from a one- to three-week stay at an in-patient rehabilitation facility to improve walking and overall function. At Home: Scoliosis Surgery Recovery Helpful aids include an adjustable bed, shower chair, elevated toilet seat, and extended grasper are for  use at home after surgery. Incision care — Patients may begin to shower one-week after surgery. Before showering, tape plastic wrap to cover the incision. Remove the tape and plastic wrap after each shower. This should be done for showers taken during the first week at home. Thereafter, shower without the plastic wrap covering the incision. For safety, it is important to be accompanied in the shower for the first two to three weeks. If there is a dressing on the incision, change it once a day until there is no staining of the sterile gauze. Thereafter, a dressing is not needed. Steri-Strips are usually placed across the incision(s) and will fall off on their own. Do not remove the Steri-Strips unless instructed to do so or if they are dangling. Respiratory Function — Lung (pulmonary) function may slightly decline after scoliosis surgery. To improve breathing function steadily with time, it is helpful to perform respiratory exercises every one to two hours for the first three weeks after surgery. Respiratory exercises include deep breathing using the incentive spirometer provided at the hospital and frequent coughing. Lung function is routinely checked during regular office visits. Activity Level — Patients are encouraged to walk. However, bending, lifting, and twisting are usually prohibited for several months or until the surgeon approves. Sports are not allowed for at least three months after surgery. When activities are resumed, it is recommended to return gradually. Conditioning exercises such as swimming, bicycling, treadmill, or jogging are a good way to start. Patients need to be aware of and use good body mechanics for the rest of their lives (eg, bending, lifting). After full healing, most patients will not have activity restrictions. However, certain sports activities such as gymnastics may not be practical. Activities that may be prohibited will be discussed by your surgeon and are dependent on the extent of your spinal fusion. Most patients do not feel restricted. Medication — Usually, nonsteroidal medications, such as aspirin, Motrin, and ibuprofen are prohibited. Tylenol can be taken. Birth control pills are stopped prior to surgery as these may increase the risk of blood clot formation during the postoperative period in women. Smoking — Smoking impairs bone from healing and hinders fusion. Patients must be committed to stop smoking two months before surgery and for a minimum of six months after surgery. Of course, it would be better just to give up the habit for a lifetime. Transportation — Avoid frequent car rides and mass transit for six weeks after surgery. Patients can go home from the hospital by car with a pillow behind their back and seatbelt in use.

Posted on  March 16, 2016  by  drstitzel       A sideways-curving spine is the most troubling aspect of scoliosis, but it’s not the real problem. To figure out what actually causes scoliosis, scientists must look beyond the curve.  We now know that spinal curvature stems from a miscommunication between the brain and the muscles that support the spine. The child’s postural control centers fail to tell the muscles how to properly respond to gravity, so instead of growing straight the spine becomes curved. But why aren’t those messages being sent?  It’s a question with which doctors continue to grapple. Is scoliosis genetic? Hereditary? Caused by environmental factors? Most of the time there’s no clear answer, and that’s what makes scoliosis such a difficult condition to treat.  In about 20 percent of cases, the scoliosis causes are obvious; birth defects, bone damage and neuromuscular disorders can all cause spinal curves to form. But they’re a small minority. More than eight in 10 scoliosis cases are idiopathic, which means they have no known cause.  Through decades of research, scientists have been able to piece together a number of observations and findings about adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . But so far those findings have defied any unified theory to explain why one child’s curve progresses rapidly while another’s requires no medical attention at all.  “Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors,” says the National Institute of Health . “Studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth, nervous system abnormalities, or other factors that have not been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Hereditary or Genetic?  Strong evidence suggests that scoliosis runs in families. Nearly a third of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have a family history of the condition, and first-degree relatives of scoliosis patients have an 11 percent chance of developing it themselves.  “It is possible that genetic factors may be involved in specific aspects of scoliosis, including the shape of a scoliosis curve and the risk for curve progression,” said scoliosis specialist Christopher R. Good, M.D., in the Journal of the Spinal Research Foundation . “A number of population studies have documented that scoliosis runs within families and that there is a higher prevalence of scoliosis among relatives of patients with scoliosis than within the general population.”  The numbers do support the theory that scoliosis is hereditary, or passed down from family members — but does that necessarily mean it’s genetic?  To answer that question, it’s important to understand the difference between genetic and hereditary. Most people use them synonymously, and in many cases they are, but there are subtle differences. A trait can be hereditary without being genetic; cultural characteristics, for example, are passed down through families but aren’t connected to genes. And genetic traits aren’t always hereditary. Consider cancer, which arises from mutant genes but in most cases isn’t inherited from one’s parents.  By examining the inheritance patterns of scoliosis, scientists have concluded that the condition is genetic as well as hereditary, but they still haven’t been able to identify which genes are responsible.  “Researchers suspect that many genes are involved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,” says the National Institute of Health. “Some of these genes likely contribute to causing the disorder, while others play a role in determining the severity of spinal curvature and whether the curve is stable or progressive. Although many genes have been studied, few clear and consistent genetic associations with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Environmental in Nature?  When studying what causes scoliosis , hereditary factors can provide a lot of insight — but they also raise as many questions as they answer.  For example, if scoliosis is hereditary, why does it also crop up in children with no family history of the condition? Another oddity researchers have noted is that the condition seems to have variable effects within each generation. A mother with a mild curve might have a daughter with a severe one, or the scoliosis might skip a generation entirely.  Scientists have explained these anomalies by acknowledging that environmental factors probably contribute to differences in scoliosis development , progression and age at detection. Consider that at least 4 percent of scoliosis curves progress to the threshold for surgery, yet only 1 percent of patients have a high genetic risk of severe curvature. If genes are a factor in only 1 percent of cases, environmental factors must account for the severity in the other 3 percent.  But identifying what those factors are is tricky. Studies have ruled out the theory that the curves are caused by specific behaviors such as slouching or carrying a heavy backpack. They’ve also found no link between scoliosis and living in an industrialized area .  Understanding what causes scoliosis is like hitting a moving target. It’s not a fixed deformity but a dynamic process that appears to spring from a combination of different factors. The more we study it, however, the better equipped we become to effectively treat the condition.  Related Posts Physical Therapy for Scoliosis Is Scoliosis Related to Sciatica Pain?

How will this affect my daily life? Am I going to be in lots of pain? Will I need surgery?  Of course, if you're planning to have children at some point in your life, there's another big question that may well pop into your head:  Will my child have scoliosis too?  We at the Scoliosis SOS Clinic are often asked this question by patients who are still learning about their condition. It seems as though a lot of scoliosis sufferers are troubled by the possibility that they might pass on their spinal curvature to their son or daughter, so today we'd like to take a closer look at this issue.  Is scoliosis passed on genetically?  For the purposes of this discussion, we're going to talk exclusively about idiopathic scoliosis , by far the condition's most common form. If your scoliosis is non-idiopathic and arose because of some underlying condition (such as osteoporosis or Marfan syndrome ), you will need to research the underlying condition in order to assess the likelihood that your child will be affected.  Idiopathic scoliosis, by definition, has no known cause, but it seems to occur as a result of genetic factors. However, that absolutely does not mean that idiopathic scoliosis sufferers always bear scoliotic children. Here are some statistics that may put your mind at ease:   Just 1 in 4 scoliosis sufferers (approx.) have at least one other case of scoliosis in their family.  If you are the child or sibling of a scoliosis sufferer, you have roughly an 11% chance of developing the condition yourself.   Bear in mind that lots of other variables still apply here: for example, scoliosis is far more likely to occur in females, so the risk of passing scoliosis on to your child is significantly lower if you're expecting a boy.   How do I check if my child has scoliosis?  Here's how to check your child for signs of scoliosis:   Ask your child to stand in front of you with their back to you. They will need to take off their top so that you can see their back and spine.  Firstly, check to see if both sides of their neck, shoulders, rib cage, waist and hips look even and symmetrical.  Secondly, ask your child to bend forwards from the waist. Look at both sides of their rib cage: does one side appear higher than the other?   Remember, every body is unique, so some minor differences are to be expected - this may not indicate the presence of scoliosis. That being said, if you are concerned, it is a good idea to get your child checked by a medical professional.  If your child develops scoliosis...  Even if your child does develop a spinal curve as they grow, it's important to remember that scoliosis sufferers can live just as well as people with healthy spines. Young scoliosis sufferers should be monitored closely, as medical observation will ensure that treatment can begin right away if and when it becomes necessary. Tackling scoliosis early (i.e. before the curve can progress too far) goes a long way towards limiting the condition's effect on the patient's health and quality of life - watch the video below for a real-life example of this (Lottie, a 12 year-old girl from Surrey).   An exercise-based treatment course that is specifically tailored to scoliosis patients (such as our own ScolioGold method ) can be very effective at combating scoliosis, especially when it is still at an early stage. If you or your child need scoliosis treatment, please feel free to contact Scoliosis SOS  and arrange a consultation with our scoliosis consultants.

Roughly 3 million new cases of the condition are diagnosed in the United States each year, with a majority of them identified as idiopathic scoliosis — a type of scoliosis that presents in children between 10 to 12 years old.  Below, Paul Sponseller, M.D. , pediatric orthopaedic expert and director of the Johns Hopkins Division of Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgery , provides five facts about scoliosis that all parents should know before their child’s next physical.  1. Early diagnosis is key.  It’s important for parents to make sure their children are receiving regular checkups so that conditions like scoliosis can be diagnosed and managed early. “If scoliosis can be diagnosed before the child has a growth spurt,” says Sponseller, “the provider can determine a treatment plan that prevents a bigger curve from forming during times of growth.”  Common signs of scoliosis include uneven shoulders or hips, but it is generally a painless condition that may go unnoticed until a routine exam or physical. “Children around the age of 10 to 12 are usually becoming more private,” Sponseller notes, “and parents are no longer involved in activities like bathing or dressing them, when they may have otherwise noticed a change.”  2. Most cases of scoliosis have no known cause.  Parents: It’s not your fault if your child is diagnosed with scoliosis. “Parents tend to ask what they could have done to prevent scoliosis,” says Sponseller, “but scoliosis is a very interesting disease, because there is currently no known cause or prevention method.”  It’s also very common for parents to ask if bad posture or heavy backpacks could have caused their child’s scoliosis. While these two things may be associated with other spine and back conditions, they do not cause scoliosis, Sponseller says.  3. Scoliosis runs in families.  “When parents hear scoliosis runs in families, they often say, ‘But nobody in our family has it,’” says Sponseller. “But in reality, it’s likely that someone does or did and it went unnoticed because it was a very mild case.” Of course, there are also instances where a child is the first in the family to develop the condition.  4. Only a small percentage of scoliosis patients require treatment.  “I see a number of patients who automatically assume they will need treatment for their scoliosis, but only a small percentage — about 30 percent — require bracing, and an even smaller percent — about 10 percent — of patients actually require surgery,” Sponseller assures.  If your child is diagnosed with scoliosis, Sponseller says not to be scared. “Scoliosis is a very manageable condition when diagnosed early.” For children who are still growing, an external torso brace can be used to prevent further worsening of the scoliosis while the child grows. Even when wearing a brace, most children live normal lives and participate in the same activities as their peers.  5. Surgery, if needed, has good outcomes.  If your child turns out to be among them, Sponseller — who performs over 150 spine surgeries a year — advises parents that while it may be a hard decision to make on behalf of your child, having surgery sooner rather than later is better. When done early, the surgery tends to be simpler, as less of the spine needs to be fused. Perhaps more importantly, he says, is your child being in good overall health and having the support of his or her family during recovery. Parents should also work with their child’s school to determine a plan for the time the child will miss during recovery — usually one to two months.

Posted on  March 16, 2016  by  drstitzel       A sideways-curving spine is the most troubling aspect of scoliosis, but it’s not the real problem. To figure out what actually causes scoliosis, scientists must look beyond the curve.  We now know that spinal curvature stems from a miscommunication between the brain and the muscles that support the spine. The child’s postural control centers fail to tell the muscles how to properly respond to gravity, so instead of growing straight the spine becomes curved. But why aren’t those messages being sent?  It’s a question with which doctors continue to grapple. Is scoliosis genetic? Hereditary? Caused by environmental factors? Most of the time there’s no clear answer, and that’s what makes scoliosis such a difficult condition to treat.  In about 20 percent of cases, the scoliosis causes are obvious; birth defects, bone damage and neuromuscular disorders can all cause spinal curves to form. But they’re a small minority. More than eight in 10 scoliosis cases are idiopathic, which means they have no known cause.  Through decades of research, scientists have been able to piece together a number of observations and findings about adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . But so far those findings have defied any unified theory to explain why one child’s curve progresses rapidly while another’s requires no medical attention at all.  “Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors,” says the National Institute of Health . “Studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth, nervous system abnormalities, or other factors that have not been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Hereditary or Genetic?  Strong evidence suggests that scoliosis runs in families. Nearly a third of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have a family history of the condition, and first-degree relatives of scoliosis patients have an 11 percent chance of developing it themselves.  “It is possible that genetic factors may be involved in specific aspects of scoliosis, including the shape of a scoliosis curve and the risk for curve progression,” said scoliosis specialist Christopher R. Good, M.D., in the Journal of the Spinal Research Foundation . “A number of population studies have documented that scoliosis runs within families and that there is a higher prevalence of scoliosis among relatives of patients with scoliosis than within the general population.”  The numbers do support the theory that scoliosis is hereditary, or passed down from family members — but does that necessarily mean it’s genetic?  To answer that question, it’s important to understand the difference between genetic and hereditary. Most people use them synonymously, and in many cases they are, but there are subtle differences. A trait can be hereditary without being genetic; cultural characteristics, for example, are passed down through families but aren’t connected to genes. And genetic traits aren’t always hereditary. Consider cancer, which arises from mutant genes but in most cases isn’t inherited from one’s parents.  By examining the inheritance patterns of scoliosis, scientists have concluded that the condition is genetic as well as hereditary, but they still haven’t been able to identify which genes are responsible.  “Researchers suspect that many genes are involved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,” says the National Institute of Health. “Some of these genes likely contribute to causing the disorder, while others play a role in determining the severity of spinal curvature and whether the curve is stable or progressive. Although many genes have been studied, few clear and consistent genetic associations with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have been identified.”  Is Scoliosis Environmental in Nature?  When studying what causes scoliosis , hereditary factors can provide a lot of insight — but they also raise as many questions as they answer.  For example, if scoliosis is hereditary, why does it also crop up in children with no family history of the condition? Another oddity researchers have noted is that the condition seems to have variable effects within each generation. A mother with a mild curve might have a daughter with a severe one, or the scoliosis might skip a generation entirely.  Scientists have explained these anomalies by acknowledging that environmental factors probably contribute to differences in scoliosis development , progression and age at detection. Consider that at least 4 percent of scoliosis curves progress to the threshold for surgery, yet only 1 percent of patients have a high genetic risk of severe curvature. If genes are a factor in only 1 percent of cases, environmental factors must account for the severity in the other 3 percent.  But identifying what those factors are is tricky. Studies have ruled out the theory that the curves are caused by specific behaviors such as slouching or carrying a heavy backpack. They’ve also found no link between scoliosis and living in an industrialized area .  Understanding what causes scoliosis is like hitting a moving target. It’s not a fixed deformity but a dynamic process that appears to spring from a combination of different factors. The more we study it, however, the better equipped we become to effectively treat the condition.  Related Posts Physical Therapy for Scoliosis Is Scoliosis Related to Sciatica Pain?

But for women with scoliosis, pregnancy and childbirth are often fraught with anxiety. Many wonder if they even can or should get pregnant.  The reality is that risks are a natural part of pregnancy, whether you have an abnormal spine or not. But just how does the scoliosis affect the entire process, from conception to delivery? Below are answers to some of the most common questions women ask about pregnancy and scoliosis.  Can I get pregnant with scoliosis?  Scoliosis often makes women hesitant to get pregnant. Many fear complications, birth defects or even fertility problems. But decades of research suggest their fears are unfounded.  Scientists have determined scoliosis doesn’t cause any particular complications—pregnancy, labor, deliver or fetal—compared to women without it. It also doesn’t appear to diminish fertility or increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or birth defects. Even women who have had spinal fusion surgery can get pregnant.  “Women who have been successfully treated for scoliosis have only minor or no additional risks at all for complications during pregnancy and delivery,” says the University of Maryland Medical Center. “A history of scoliosis does not endanger the child.”  Will my baby have scoliosis?  No one knows what causes idiopathic scoliosis, but we do know that it can be hereditary. About 30 percent people with scoliosis have family members with the same condition.  Still, having scoliosis doesn’t guarantee that your child will develop it. Only about a third of children whose parents have scoliosis will develop it. The risk can also depend on your baby’s gender, since scoliosis is far more prevalent in girls than in boys.  Will pregnancy cause my curves to progress?  Women with scoliosis often wonder whether pregnancy will make their curvature worse. The good news is that as long as the curve has already stopped progressing , weight gain from pregnancy won’t propel it further.  “Having one or more pregnancies does not appear to affect curve progression in scoliosis,” says orthopedic surgeon and researcher Josh E. Schroeder .  He acknowledges that there is some evidence that among patients who have previously worn a brace, pregnant women “had a higher risk of curve progression compared with never-pregnant women.” But, he adds, “the overall strength of evidence for this conclusion is low.”  Will my scoliosis symptoms get worse during pregnancy?  For women with scoliosis, pregnancy triggers the same symptoms women without scoliosis experience.  For example, nearly all women have mild to moderate back pain at some point during their pregnancy—while half experience lower back pain—so it’s difficult to tell whether the pain stems from the pregnancy or the scoliosis. However, a pre-existing back condition (such as scoliosis) does increase the risk of lower back pain during pregnancy.  Back pain can start as early three months and continue for up to six months after delivery. By the ninth month, the likelihood of lower back pain reaches 50 percent.  Breathlessness is another common symptom pregnant women experience, particularly in the early months. This is due to the rise in progesterone, which increases both respiratory rate and depth. Expectant mothers with scoliosis may experience mildly restricted lung capacity, but they rarely have breathing problems.  Does scoliosis complicate labor?  Once upon a time, doctors automatically scheduled C-sections for women with scoliosis. But as more and more women opt for vaginal delivery, doctors are discovering it can be done successfully—without any unusual complications.  For the most part, delivery is the same for women with and without scoliosis. But there are a few differences, such as:   Expectant mothers with crooked hips can experience “stalls” during labor due to mal-positioning of the baby.  Women weakened by scoliosis may have a harder time pushing during labor.  Scoliosis can make it difficult to receive an epidural, especially for those who have had spinal fusion surgery.   Women who are pregnant with scoliosis should discuss delivery and pain management options with their doctor well before they go into labor.  How can I support my body during pregnancy and delivery?  Your physical condition can make a big difference in the outcome of your delivery. Stretches can help relieve back pain, while strengthening exercises help support the birthing process and improve the baby’s positioning. Regular chiropractic adjustments to keep your spine in alignment can also be beneficial to your baby’s position.  If you have scoliosis and are considering becoming pregnant, there are treatments that can help prepare your body for the process. Through brain-muscle retraining and nutritional support, you can stop scoliosis progression and reduce pain to pave the way for an easier pregnancy.  What if my scoliosis is severe?  In cases of severe scoliosis, getting pregnant can be a bit risker than usual. For example:   Back pain can be significantly worse for women with severe curves.  Breathing problems may occur later in the pregnancy.  Both the baby and the scoliosis curve may need to be closely monitored.   To prevent complications, women with severe scoliosis should consult their doctor before becoming pregnant.  Legions of women with scoliosis have successfully carried and delivered healthy babies. Your doctor can work with you to ensure you’ll be one of them.

Posted on  November 4, 2015  by  drstitzel       A scoliosis diagnosis can be scary, especially when doctors start talking about back braces and spinal fusion surgery. The good news is that informed parents are far more likely to achieve a positive outcome for their children.  It all starts with understanding what scoliosis is — and what it isn’t. Scoliosis is a complex neuromuscular condition that causes the spine to curve. Although most people think of the curve itself as the problem, it’s actually just the symptom of a deeper defect: a neuro-hormonal imbalance that prevents the brain from detecting and correcting the spine’s abnormal posture.  While scoliosis isn’t common, it’s not as rare as you might think. Around 3-5% percent of kids develop some degree of scoliosis during their teenage years. The vast majority of the time, it’s mild and only requires scoliosis specific exercise treatment. About 10 percent of the time, the curves progress enough to require surgical intervention.  Types of Scoliosis  In most cases, doctors don’t know what causes scoliosis. It most commonly arises during adolescence and can’t be attributed to a specific cause. However, there are several other types of scoliosis that can arise during various stages of life, and their origins are less mysterious. Here’s a look at the main types of scoliosis:  Idiopathic. In eight out of 10 scoliosis patients, the specific cause is unknown. Idiopathic scoliosis most commonly develops during adolescence, during periods of rapid growth. While about 80 percent of cases occur between ages 10 and 18, idiopathic scoliosis can be discovered at any age.   Infantile: ages 0 to 3  Juvenile: ages 4 to 9  Adolescent: ages 10 to 18  Adult: older than 18   Functional. With functional scoliosis, the spine itself is normal but is pulled into a curve by the surrounding muscles. This usually occurs because of a defect or imbalance in the patient’s posture. For example, children with one leg longer than the other or adults who engage in repetitive asymmetrical activities (such as tennis or golf) can develop this condition.  Degenerative. While it’s far more common to find scoliosis in kids than in adults, this particular type arises after the age of 40. It’s the result of weakening in the spine due to age-related conditions such as arthritis, bone spurs, osteoporosis and disc degeneration.  Who’s at Risk?  Although most of the time we don’t know what causes scoliosis , scientists have identified several risk factors that increase the odds of developing it. For example, we know that scoliosis affects seven girls for every one boy. Most early cases occur in girls between the ages of 8 and 14 who have not begun menstruating and have thin, lanky bodies.  Genetics also play a role. Around 30 percent of scoliosis patients have a family history of the condition, and while there are many factors involved in the development of scoliosis, genetics account for about 38 percent . This means kids who have siblings, parents or grandparents with the condition should get screened.  Unfortunately, scoliosis is not preventable. Research has ruled out a connection between idiopathic scoliosis and specific behaviors such as poor posture or carrying a heavy backpack.  Stages of Scoliosis  The early signs of scoliosis in children can be difficult to detect. With mild curves, symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked. It’s often not until the curves become severe than the condition begins to cause pain or difficulty moving.  However, alert parents can sometimes spot the early signs of scoliosis:   Uneven hemline, pant legs or shirt sleeves  Abnormal posture, such as tilted shoulders, rib cage or hips  Tilted eye line  Unexplained back pain  Low vitamin D levels  Fatigue after long periods of sitting or standing  Body that leans to one side  Slight limp or one leg that appears longer than the other  Ribs that stick out during a full forward bend   To catch more cases before they become severe, many schools and pediatricians screen for scoliosis in children at the fifth- or sixth-grade level. The Scoliosis Research Society, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons all recommend that girls get screened twice at ages 10 and 12 and boys get screened once at age 13 or 14.  Screenings typically involve a using forward bend test to look for abnormalities in the spine and posture. If visible symptoms are found, the next step is to see a doctor for diagnosis, which typically requires an x-ray.  The recommended treatment depends on the size of the curve, which is used to determine what stage the scoliosis is in. While not all scoliosis cases will continue to advance, the odds of progression increase dramatically as the curve grows.  0-10 degrees: No scoliosis is detected.  10-25 degrees: At this stage, scoliosis is considered mild. Doctors will often recommend observation of small curves to determine how quickly they’re worsening. But the wait-and-see method has its risks. Below 19 degrees, there’s only a 22 percent chance the curves will continue to progress, but once the spinal curve reaches 20 degrees, the likelihood of progression jumps to 68 percent. Early intervention such as ScoliSMART’s Small Curve Camp can stop scoliosis before it reaches this threshold, while reducing existing curvature.  25-40 degrees: If the child’s spine is still growing when the curve reaches 25 degrees, many doctors will recommend bracing to slow or prevent further progression — despite growing evidence that bracing doesn’t work. Alternative therapies have had much greater success at halting scoliosis. For example, the Scoliosis Activity Suit combines active resistance exercises with other treatments to achieve a 90 percent success rate at stabilizing or reducing spinal curves. It’s important to start using such treatments as early as possible, because once the curvature reaches 30 degrees, the odds of progression leap to 90 percent.  50+ degrees: At 50 degrees, most spinal surgeons will recommend spinal fusion surgery in an attempt to reduce the curve and prevent further progression. However, this high-risk surgery can have devastating side effects and rarely leads to a positive outcome. Fortunately, there are many non-surgical scoliosis treatment options that can help support and strengthen the spine without fusing its bones together. It’s important to research all of the options so you can make an informed decision for your child.  Because early detection has such a big impact on treatment outcomes, it’s wise to have your child screened if you suspect scoliosis. If you recently received a diagnosis, it’s never too early to start looking into non-surgical scoliosis treatment options.

Is anyone aware of any studies on the likelihood of passing on these genetics?  My curvatures were at 59 and 68 degrees before surgery, so I know Im in the extreme case category.  Does this further increase the chances for my kids?  LindaRacine 08-11-2004, 05:13 PM Hi Stacie...  As far as I know, there are still no statistics on the probability of passing along idiopathic scoliosis to your offspring.  There are studies in progress, so hopefully we'll know some day soon.  Although I know a lot of people who have scoliosis in their family, I know a lot more who don't.  I'm one of 8 siblings, and the only one with scoliosis.  The only thing that I would recommend is that you have your kids checked by their pediatrician on a yearly basis.  Regards, Linda  DaveWolpert 08-12-2004, 10:42 AM I do think it's safe to say that there is at least a slightly higher statistical probability that your children will develop scoliosis. Scoliosis does tend to run in families, so there must be some genetic component to the spread of the disorder. Linda is right, though, that its inheritance is unpredictable and inconsistent.  There is no obvious genetic link to the severity of the curvatures. I have moderately severe scoliosis, while my sister and one of my cousins, for example, both have very mild 10-15 degree curvatures. These curves weren't even noticed by them or their doctors until carefully checked after I was diagnosed with a progressive curve. Mild kyphosis also runs in my family, though I don't have it. You really can never know.  Dave  Danite 08-18-2004, 12:04 PM Good afternoon, I did go through a very intensive Genetic research after having a daughter with a very similar deformity that was conducted by the University of Michigan Hospital in 1982 and the odds for me to have a child with a genetic deformity (Spinal) was actually below the normal or average percentile.  I do have a congenital birth defect and the first spinal fusion in the state of Michigan in 1954, it is severe and rotoscoliosis with spinal stenosis...etc. In 1984 my wife gave birth to our other daughter and she is completely free of any congenital spinal disorder, praise God.  It is very scary to be in this position,  I understand how you must feel.  At 54 years old, I can no longer work full-time or do normal life activities without some form of accomodation.  But I am very happy and glad to have two wonderful and beautiful daughters, for your information.  The one with the scoliosis does have a rod and is working full-time at the age of twenty-two. Never say never...  spincon58 08-19-2004, 11:39 PM Hi,  Somehow I passed scoliosis to 3 of my children..my daughter 23 has a 26 degree, my son 21 has 14 degree and my daughter 12 has a 19 which still needs to be monitored...so I think I gave it to them....  LindaRacine 08-20-2004, 11:30 AM Hi Connie...  If you haven't already done so, I'd like to urge you to contact Carol Wise at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital.  She's conducting research into the genetics of scoliosis, and was specifically looking for families where at least 4 members are affected.  I don't know if she's still looking, but it might be worthwhile for you to make contact.  I have 2 phone numbers for her: (214)559-7881 and (214)648-1677.  Regards, Linda  Danite 08-20-2004, 12:04 PM I must add, that no matter what any genetic research professional discover, I will always wonder if some how it was pass by genetics.  As I have said, my back is behind me, my disability is second and I'm a person first.  stees 08-22-2004, 09:49 PM Stacie,  Another interesting consideration;  research on and treatment for scoliosis is far advanced from what it was like when I was growing up, and even 15 years ago.  Even 5 years ago.  It may be that it is not such a problem as it was.  :)  stella 09-14-2004, 02:28 AM my daughter doctor told me that if she ever has children they have to be cheked for scoliosis. stella,  Danite 09-14-2004, 11:19 AM Hi Stella,  It is true, but remember all children and even adults today are checked for Scoliosis, if discovered at an early age sometimes surgery can be avoided which is the best option.  My daughters will have children someday (I hope) and they too will be checked for scoliosis, remember the disability does not make the person, we are individuals first and the disability is second. I do not blame myself or my grandparents for the scoliosis but the condition of the environment and the way we live today is what I believe causes a lot of our deseases or illnesses.  I pray and work so that someday in my children time, that people are judge by their abilities not disabilities.  That all individuals with disabilities will understand that they are people first, and they can control their future.  We all have barriers, or hardles that we must jump in our life, some of us have higher hardles, but we can do it.  Never say never, and always fight for your rights, we our not second citizens but equals in this world.  Ms. Scarlett 10-20-2004, 02:46 PM I've read recently that Scoliosis is passed on through every third generation but don't hold any faith in that because all the women in my mothers' family had Kyphosis and I have major Scoliosis.  Not sure where on the internet I read that.  On the other hand, I have two daughters 18 and 22 years of age and a son 20 years old and none of them have any spinal deformaties.  Make sure that if you have young children your family physician checks their spine every time they go to see him/her.  Danite 10-21-2004, 11:46 AM I too heard that it skips generations, I pray that it stops with me and does not continue in my family.  From my point of view, it is not the scoliosis or surgery that makes our life difficult.  It is the views and acceptance of others that make it an issue that turns it in to a psychological game.  Even the medical model itself does what it can to promote such views that we are second citizens, all this does is promote denial, and plays mental games on us.  We do not need to look very far, employment, sports, and even politics has a difficult time in accepting people with disabilities.  Not too mention our own parents sometimes can not accept us as individuals or they blame themselves.  Sorry about venting again, it is just one of those things...God Bless.  Mary Lou 10-21-2004, 12:55 PM I wish there was more research into the hereditary part of Scoliosis.  My 13 year old daughter has Kyphoscoliosis and as far as we can tell, she is the only one in either side of the family with Kyphosis or Scoliosis.  Her doctor says her Kyphosis is most likely caused by Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease/disorder.  There are atleast four generations in her father's side of the family who are effected with CMT to some degree and none of them even heard of the Kyphosis/Scoliosis/CMT connection until I discovered it by mistake while doing my own research.  My personal way of helping find answers that we are all looking for is to donate to Scoliosis research.  I have no connection to the research organization other than I hope they can offer more information to us as a group.  Mary Lou  Danite 10-21-2004, 01:41 PM Oh I forgot to mention that we did go through a genetic research program at University of Michigan when our daughter was born and they said it was very unlikely that it was genetic.  Our daughter was born with severe scoliosis and received her surgery at the age of thirteen.  But determined it was a total different desease, at the same time I can not help but wonder because of my own disability.  They said that we had less then a 1% chance of having another child with scoliosis, and we did have another daughter after one year of trying and she did not have scoliosis, praise God.  So never say never.  gotleyd 10-21-2004, 02:48 PM Hello, I unfortunately have scoliosis because my mother has it. I'm the middle child of three and am the only one who has it. She doesn't have it as bad as I do. It doesn't bother her or progressed but I'm in constant pain and am considering surgery. I have a 15 month old son and I worry that he will get it but  I will have to wait and make sure that something is done for him sooner if he does have it so he won't go through all this when he's my age. I'm 26. His doctor says they don't check for scoliosis until he's 8. That was my first question on his first visit. If you are going to have children or are pregnant discusing it with your doc would be a good idea. Leyda:) :)  Ms. Scarlett 10-22-2004, 11:01 AM Well, as mentioned before, none of my children have it but my mother and her sisters all have it and I have it.  My sisters and brothers do not have it - I'm the only one.   It would be interesting to find out how the gene skipped going to my children.  Now, my son on the other hand has severe psoriasis - worst case his skin specialist has ever seen - his father has it too - very sad to see him when he breaks out.  He's been in a 2 year study where he has had to try different medications and self inject a drug to either eliminate the disease or make it lie dormant - when the study ended he blossomed again like crazy.  He was taking a drug that is given to people who have had transplant surgery - this was to boost the immune system.  He is now being considered for gene therapy - he's only 20 and has suffered with this for 7 years.  I'm wondering if gene therapy would be an option for those who have a history of scoliosis or other genetic conditions like it BEFORE they decide to conceive children.  Wouldn't mind looking into that one.  Ms. Scarlett 10-22-2004, 11:21 AM Just a few comments on the term "Disability"  C.P.P.'s criteria:  * be under 65 * have contributed to the CPP for a minimum number of years * have a "severe and prolonged" disability that prevents him or her from working at any job on a regular basis  First of all, what is determined by the government to be "Severe" and "Prolonged"?  In Canada, having scoliosis and having extensive surgery to correct scoliosis may not put you in the catagory as having a disability.  I have been out of work since April 2003 and have been trying to get a disability pension.  The Federal Canada Pension Plan denied me disabilty benefits because I am able to use a computer and have a post secondary education - meaning - I can type and talk.  This decision was made by a person who was an RN who had never seen me, never spoke to me and merely was going by my medical history and employment history.  There were only minimal medical reports available for her review at the time the decision was made.  I have appealed the decision and go before a Tribunal Board in December of this year - it has been a long long time.  Two weeks ago I receive approval from the Provincial government who deemed me as being disabled.  I made my application to them in February of this year and was approved on October 6th, 2004.  I did not speak to anyone at all nor did I receive mail from them.  I called their office to inquire about the status of my file on October 6th and they told me that they had just made the decision that day - and said that I was officially disabled.  Regardless of what the Provincial Government says, the Federal Government can still refuse my disability benefits - this is because the back problems people have vary from person to person and often times they cannot be physically seen by the naked eye.  I have been amazed by who they grant disability benefits to and have recently found that someone I know who has been diagnosed as being Bi Polar is on permanent disability through the Canada Pension Plan (she's 20 years old) - I have medical documentation which they also have in their possession which has that very same diagnosis and I'm STILL not deemed as being disabled in their eyes - they told me "Everyone gets depressed..."  I couldn't believe it.  Very very unusual system here - I can only hope for the best at my hearing.  Has anyone else had difficulty getting their benefits after surgery??

Smith, MD  Despite a tremendous amount of scientific research, the causes of some types of scoliosis remain largely unknown. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may be a disease that is inherited as a genetic trait, much like some other diseases, such as sickle cell anemia. The gene that causes scoliosis remains undiscovered, but scientists are trying to find this gene using new techniques for analyzing genetic inheritance. Defining the role of genetics in scoliosis is currently the focus of intense research at a number of academic centers throughout the world.  There is strong evidence that an abnormal gene is partially responsible for some forms of scoliosis. It is possible that genetic factors may influence important aspects of scoliosis such as the pattern of curvature (left versus right curves), the shape of the curve, and the risk of progression. The tendency for scoliosis to appear in people who are closely related, such as mothers and their daughters, identical twins, and first degree relatives, suggests that scoliosis can be inherited. For example, several studies have shown that the incidence of scoliosis in first degree relatives (such as parents, siblings, and children) ranges from 7-11%. In contrast, the incidence in second-degree relatives drops to less than 4%. The exact pattern of inheritance remains unknown, and the gene that is responsible for scoliosis has yet to be identified.  One research project that is attempting to find the gene responsible for scoliosis is currently being conducted at Primary Children's Medical Center and the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. This research is being conducted in collaboration with EmerGen, a gene discovery company that is also based in Salt Lake City. We are planning to analyze the patterns of inheritance of scoliosis in families where multiple family members are affected by scoliosis. This type of research has been successful in identifying the causes of other diseases, such as arthrogryposis, a condition that causes stiff joints and limb abnormalities in children. If you are part of a family in which many of your family members have scoliosis and you are interested in participating in this study, please let us know.  Scoliosis and Genetics FAQs  How can I tell if my family has a genetic tendency towards scoliosis? Ask other members of your family. Although about 2% of the general population may have mild scoliosis, a much smaller number have scoliosis significant enough to require treatment with a brace or surgery. Significant scoliosis is often present in 7-10 % of first degree relatives (mothers, daughters, children). If you are interested in this, try a survey of all of your family members at a family reunion or holiday event.  Is there a test for the scoliosis gene? No. The gene or genes for scoliosis has not been identified. When these genes are discovered, it may be possible to develop a test for it.  If I have scoliosis, what are the chances that my children will have scoliosis? Most studies have shown a mother with significant scoliosis runs the risk of having a daughter develop scoliosis approximately 5-10 % of the time. If you have scoliosis and have teenage girls, then it would be a good idea to look at their back during their adolescent growth spurt. This is a time where girls are very modest and it can be hard to tell if they are developing a curve unless you look very closely. The iscoliosis.com self-assessment tool can be very helpful if you are unsure.  What is "gene therapy"? Does gene therapy exist for scoliosis? The concept of gene therapy is that an abnormal gene can be repaired or replaced in the genetic code and then the gene will then function normally. At the present time, the gene or genes for scoliosis have not been found. The technology for genetic engineering is rapidly advancing and the medical community has great hopes for the possibility of the genetic treatment of diseases. Although scientists have the ability to clone sheep in the laboratory, the application of gene therapy for humans is still in the future. Currently, there are no possibilities for gene therapy as a treatment for scoliosis.  Are there any studies being conducted in your region about the genetics of scoliosis? If so, how could I participate? Yes. We are currently conducting a study of the genetics of scoliosis at Primary Children's Medical Center and the University of Utah. This is a collaborative effort with EmerGen, a gene discovery company in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: Review and Current Concepts   BRIAN V. REAMY, LT COL, USAF, MC, Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland JOSEPH B. SLAKEY, CDR, MC, USNR, Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, Virginia Am Fam Physician. 2001 Jul 1;64(1):111-117.  Related Editorial Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Article Sections Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is present in 2 to 4 percent of children between 10 and 16 years of age. It is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees accompanied by vertebral rotation. It is thought to be a multigene dominant condition with variable phenotypic expression. Scoliosis can be identified by the Adam's forward bend test during physical examination. Severe pain, a left thoracic curve or an abnormal neurologic examination are red flags that point to a secondary cause for spinal deformity. Specialty consultation and magnetic resonance imaging are needed if red flags are present. Of adolescents diagnosed with scoliosis, only 10 percent have curves that progress and require medical intervention. The main risk factors for curve progression are a large curve magnitude, skeletal immaturity and female gender. The likelihood of curve progression can be estimated by measuring the curve magnitude using the Cobb method on radiographs and by assessing skeletal growth potential using Tanner staging and Risser grading. Recent research has led to a better understanding of the natural history of scoliosis. However, the optimal strategy for screening, diagnosing and treating this common spinal deformity remains controversial. Of adolescents diagnosed with scoliosis, only 10 percent have curve progression requiring medical intervention. 1 The ability to estimate which curves require therapy has led to more appropriate treatment with observation, bracing or surgery. Family physicians need to differentiate patients with stable or minimally progressive scoliosis who can be observed from patients with scoliosis that is at high risk for progression. They need to determine the patients they can follow and those who need referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Unnecessary referrals of adolescents with minimal scoliosis who are at low risk for progression can cause marked anxiety and lost time from school and work, and lead to unnecessary radiation exposure. 2 Delayed referrals of patients with high-risk curves can lead to increased morbidity. In either situation, the psychologic and social effects of this disease can be profound. 2 This article describes an approach to diagnosing and treating scoliosis that allows physicians to lessen the adverse psychologic, medical and economic effects of over-referral or delayed referral of adolescents to orthopedic subspecialists. Classification Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References The Scoliosis Research Society has defined scoliosis as a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees as measured using the Cobb method on a standing radiograph. 3 Idiopathic scoliosis is a structural curve with no clear underlying cause. Secondary causes for scoliosis can usually be identified by radiography and clinical examination ( Table 1 ) . Idiopathic scoliosis is classified based on the age of the patient when it is first identified. Infantile scoliosis has an onset before three years of age. The infantile form accounts for fewer than 1 percent of all cases. Juvenile scoliosis is first detected between three and 10 years of age. The juvenile form occurs in 12 to 21 percent of all patients with idiopathic scoliosis. 4 Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is found between age 10 and skeletal maturity. 4 The adolescent form accounts for the majority of cases of idiopathic scoliosis. Prevalence Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Scoliosis is present in 2 to 4 percent of children between 10and 16yearsofage. 5 The ratio of girls to boys with small curves of 10 degrees is equal but increases to a ratio of 10 girls for every one boy with curves greater than 30 degrees. 5 Scoliosis in girls tends to progress more often and, therefore, girls more commonly need treatment than boys. 5 The prevalence of curves greater than 30 degrees is approximately 0.2 percent, and the prevalence for curves greater than 40 degrees is approximately 0.1 percent. 1 Improved understanding of the natural history and prognosis of this disease can help the physician predict the patients with scoliosis who need treatment.

Natural History/Prognosis Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Once a diagnosis of scoliosis has been made, the primary concerns are whether there is an underlying cause and if the curve will progress. The three main determinants of progression are patient gender, future growth potential and the curve magnitude at the time of diagnosis. 1 In all cases, females have a risk of curve progression 10 times higher than males. 1 The greater the growth potential and the larger the curve, the greater the likelihood of curve progression. Evaluation of growth potential is done by assessing the Tanner stage and the Risser grade. Tanner stage 2 to 3 occurs just after the onset of the pubertal growth spurt and is the time of maximum progression of scoliosis. 6 The Risser grade (zero to 5) gives a useful estimate of how much skeletal growth remains by grading the progress of bony fusion of the iliac apophysis. The iliac apophysis ossifies in a predictable fashion from anterolateral to posteromedial along the iliac crest. Risser grades are as follows: grade zero signifies no ossification, grade 1 signifies up to 25 percent ossification, grade 2 signifies 26 to 50 percent ossification, grade 3 signifies 51 to 75 percent ossification, grade 4 signifies 76 up to 100 percent ossification and grade 5 signifies complete bony fusion of the apophysis 7 ( Figure 1 ) . In one study, 8 the Risser grade was directly correlated with the risk of curve progression. View/Print Figure FIGURE 1. Risser grades zero to 5. Grading is based on the degree of bony fusion of the iliac apophysis, from grade zero (no ossification) to grade 5 (complete bony fusion). FIGURE 1. Risser grades zero to 5. Grading is based on the degree of bony fusion of the iliac apophysis, from grade zero (no ossification) to grade 5 (complete bony fusion). The magnitude of the curve is best determined by measurement of the Cobb angle, which is derived from a standard posteroanterior standing radiograph of the spine. The Cobb angle is the angle formed by a line drawn perpendicular to the top of the superior vertebrae of the scoliotic curve and a similar perpendicular line drawn along the bottom of the inferior vertebrae ( Figure 2 ) . View/Print Figure FIGURE 2. The Cobb method of measuring the degree of scoliosis. The physician chooses the most tilted vertebrae above and below the apex of the curve. The angle between intersecting lines drawn perpendicular to the top of the superior vertebrae and the bottom of the inferior vertebrae is the Cobb angle (here, 62 degrees). FIGURE 2. The Cobb method of measuring the degree of scoliosis. The physician chooses the most tilted vertebrae above and below the apex of the curve. The angle between intersecting lines drawn perpendicular to the top of the superior vertebrae and the bottom of the inferior vertebrae is the Cobb angle (here, 62 degrees). The risk of curve progression can be estimated by taking into account the patient's sex, time of menarche and growth potential (Tanner stage and Risser grade), and the magnitude of the curve. This is key information to help with decisions about the need for referral to an orthopedic surgeon and, in those who are not referred, about examination frequency for curves at lower risk of progression. It is important to remember that this information does not conclusively determine whether a specific curve will progress, only the general risk of a curve progressing. Table 2 summarizes the results of multiple studies done to assist in predicting the risk of curve progression in adolescents; the table can also assist in patient counseling. 5, 8– 11 View/Print Table TABLE 2 Risk of Curve Progression Curve (degree) Growth potential (Risser grade) Risk* 10 to 19 Limited (2 to 4) Low 10 to 19 High (0 to 1) Moderate 20 to 29 Limited (2 to 4) Low/moderate 20 to 29 High (0 to 1) High >29 Limited (2 to 4) High >29 High (0 to 1) Very high *— Low risk = 5 to 15 percent; moderate risk = 15 to 40 percent; high risk = 40 to 70 percent; very high risk = 70 to 90 percent .

Information from references 5 and 8 through 11 . The risk that an untreated adolescent with scoliosis will have a curve progress into adulthood has been determined. Curves less than 30 degrees at bone maturity are unlikely to progress, whereas curves measuring from 30 to 50 degrees progress an average of 10 to 15 degrees over a lifetime. Curves greater than 50 degrees at maturity progress steadily at a rate of 1 degree per year. 1 In most patients, life-threatening effects on pulmonary function do not occur until the scoliotic curve is 100 degrees or greater. 1 Of equal significance is the fact that significant psychologic illness has been found in up to 19 percent of females who have curves greater than 40 degrees as adults. 2 Social isolation, limited job opportunities and lower marriage rates are possible consequences. Pathophysiology Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Many studies have attempted to uncover the pathophysiologic process underlying idiopathic scoliosis. Multiple abnormalities have been found, yet none has been conclusively linked to all cases. Studies of twins 12 have given the firmest indication that the most significant factor is genetic. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis 13 showed that not only is the risk for scoliosis greater in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins, the rate of curve progression is nearly identical among twins subjected to a variety of environmental influences. Current theorists believe that scoliosis is a multigene dominant condition with variable phenotypic expression. 5 Therefore, even though scoliosis is typically present in most members of the same family, its severity can vary widely from parent to child and sibling to sibling. When both parents have scoliosis, the risk that their children will require treatment is 50 times that in the general population. 7 Screening Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Screening for scoliosis was common in schools and communities in past years. Over-referral of adolescents with insignificant curves led to a marked decrease in many such programs. Recent studies have demonstrated that over-referral is common even when multiple diagnostic modalities are used. 14 , 15 The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends screening girls at ages 11 and 13, and screening boys once at age 13 or 14 years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended scoliosis screening with the Adam's forward bending test at routine health visits at 10, 12,14 and 16 years of age, although evidence does not exist to support these recommendations. 2 In 1996, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released its opinion on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The Task Force noted that “there is insufficient evidence for or against routine screening of asymptomatic adolescents for idiopathic scoliosis. Clinicians should remain alert for large spinal curvatures when examining adolescents.” 2 HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. The history and physical examination are intended to exclude secondary causes for the spinal deformity. The patient should be asked about a family history of scoliosis, menstrual onset, and the presence of pain and neurologic changes, including bowel and bladder dysfunction. The presence of severe pain or neurologic symptoms would be atypical for idiopathic scoliosis. The physical examination should include an assessment of Tanner stage and a complete neurologic examination. Peak curve progression occurs during Tanner stage 2 or 3. Any abnormal neurologic findings should raise concern for spinal cord pathology. Although there is no ideal screening test, the Adam's forward bend test requires no additional equipment (such as a scoliometer or humpometer) and can help to identify scoliosis. 5 The child bends forward at the waist until the spine becomes parallel to the horizontal plane, while holding palms together with arms extended. The examiner looks along the horizontal plane of the spine from the back and side to detect an asymmetry in the contour of the back known as a “rib hump” ( Figure 3 ) . A rib hump is a hallmark of scoliotic curves greater than 10 degrees and should prompt radiographic evaluation. The direction of curves in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is remarkably consistent. Ninety percent of thoracic curves are to the right. 16 Therefore, left thoracic curves should raise a red flag and prompt more extensive evaluation. Additional red flags include markedly painful scoliosis, untoward stiffness, deviation to one side during the forward bend test, sudden rapid progression in a previously stable curve, extensive progression in a patient after skeletal maturity, abnormal neurologic findings and the stigmata of other clinical syndromes associated with spinal curvature. 5, 16, 17 Radiography and Additional Tests Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Abnormalities on physical examination require radiographic evaluation with a single standing posteroanterior radiograph to allow measurement of the curve using the Cobb method and Risser grading of the iliac apophysis. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated whenever there is a left thoracic curve, unusual pain or abnormalities on neurologic examination, or other red flags, to evaluate for spondylolisthesis, tumors or syringomyelia. 18 Referral Guidelines and Treatment Jump to section + Abstract Classification Prevalence Natural History/Prognosis Pathophysiology Screening Radiography and Additional Tests Referral Guidelines and Treatment References Treatment options for patients with scoliosis range from the unproven or harmful to the beneficial. Physical therapy, chiropractic care, biofeedback and electric stimulation have not been shown to alter the natural history of scoliosis. 2, 7, 12 In contrast, bracing and spinal surgery have been proved to alter the natural history of curve progression. Bracing techniques have also improved markedly; braces are more comfortable and better tolerated than in the past, when studies had shown that adolescents wore their braces only 65 percent of the time they were intended to use them. 19 In addition, most modern braces are of the underarm thoracolumbar-sacral orthosis type, which can be worn under the clothing. A recent study showed that bracing had a 74 percent success rate at halting curve progression. 20 It is important to counsel adolescents and their parents that bracing does not correct scoliosis but may prevent significant progression of the spinal curvature. Orthosis use is usually continued until the patient reaches Risser grade 4 or 5. 5 Spinal surgery with instrumentation corrects a significant part of the deformity and hopefully stops further progression of the scoliotic curve. Current consensus is that surgery should be performed for curves greater than 40 to 45 degrees when there is growth remaining. 5 , 21 Many implants are available to provide excellent stability and strong corrective forces to the spinal column. 22 Modern surgery is accompanied by spinal cord monitoring using somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials, thereby decreasing the rate of neurologic injury to one in 7,000 procedures. 5 View/Print Figure FIGURE 3.

Adolescent scoliosis can be followed by the family physician if the curve has a low risk of progression and an underlying cause has been excluded. Curves that demonstrate progression in patients with continued growth remaining and curves with a high risk of progression should be referred to an orthopedic subspecialist.
