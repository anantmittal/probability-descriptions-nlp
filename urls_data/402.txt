They may think; "we want kids, and all this treatment is expensive and unpleasant, so let's just have 2 kids and get it over with". When they are fully aware of the risks to the children if delivery is premature, some couples no longer prefer a multiple pregnancy. However, after full disclosure of the risks, many couples still hope for twins. Of course, they are also hoping that their children will be perfectly healthy. The psychological, social, and economic stresses involved with caring for twins is substantial, but patients often say they would welcome facing those stresses if they were so blessed. The risks of a multiple pregnancy are high. These expectant mothers face an increased risk for developing complications of pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, hemorrhage, and other complications. The risks to the fetuses and children are mostly related to premature delivery and can be very severe. Compared to a singleton, a twin is about five times more likely to die in the first year of life. For a triplet, this risk is about 13 times that of a singleton. The risk of having a lifelong handicap (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) is increased about 10 times for twins compared to singles, and these risks are substantially higher for triplets. Quadruplet and other high-order pregnancies are much riskier. Fortunately, with current embryo transfer policies, pregnancies beyond triplets are rare with IVF.      Statistics about the number of embryos transferred and multiple pregnancies  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) gather, tabulate, and publish annual national summaries and clinic-specific reports of IVF statistics.   These reports cover live birth rates, twin and triplet rates, the average number of embryos transferred per patient and other variables   The report for IVF cycles in 2015 is currently available  on the SART website, the CDC report lags behind the SART report - 2015 preliminary data is the most recent available from CDC.   Links to the SART and CDC reports   These annual reports show the trend in the United States toward transferring fewer embryos.   In 1997, the average number of embryos transferred to women under 35 was 3.7  By 2000, it was down to 2.9  Over the same time period, there was a significant increase in the overall live birth rates for IVF procedures  At the same time, the percentage of births that were triplets or more dropped from about 14% to about 9%  However, over the same period of time, no progress was made with regard to reducing the rate of twin pregnancies, which remained at about 32% of births.  Over that 4-year period, US IVF centers transferred less embryos, resulting in higher success rates, a lower percentage of triplets, but no change in the percentage of twins.   In general, European infertility clinics are transferring fewer embryos as compared to American IVF centers. On average, they have lower pregnancy rates and a lower percentage of multiple births than clinics in the United States. There are several factors involved in this difference. In some European countries, physicians are restricted by law so that they cannot transfer more than two embryos. Also, IVF is more commonly paid for by insurance or socialized medical systems in Europe. In the United States, couples with insurance coverage for IVF services are more likely to prefer fewer embryos for transfer. By comparison, couples who must pay out of pocket for IVF often request that more embryos be transferred. They tend to be fearful of failure because of the high financial costs associated with repeating the IVF process.       What is the appropriate number of embryos to transfer?   In 2017, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART published revised guidelines regarding the appropriate maximum number of embryos to transfer. The ASRM guidelines suggest a maximum number of embryos to transfer based on the day of transfer (cleavage stage vs. blast), "prognosis category" (favorable vs. all others), whether preimplantation genetic screening was done to screen out chromosomally abnormal embryos, and female age .   Current ASRM - SART guidelines on maximum number of embryos to transfer (updated 2017)     Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Cleavage-stage Embryos (day 2 or day 3 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  3  4    All others  2  3  4  5    Euploid  1  1  1  1       Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Blastocyst Embryos (day 5 or day 6 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  2  3    All others  2  2  3  3    Euploid  1  1  1  1     The ASRM identifies the following characteristics as being associated with a "more favorable prognosis":   First cycle of IVF  Good embryo quality by morphology grading criteria  Excess embryos available for freezing  Having a previous successful IVF cycle    These guidelines have been helpful in limiting the number of embryos transferred, particularly in patients with the most favorable prognosis. However, many couples in the other categories who choose to have more than two transferred could still be at high risk for multiples, including triplets. Also, patients with embryos that have a high potential for implantation might have a high risk of twins if they have two transferred. Couples with a very high chance for pregnancy can be identified on the day of embryo transfer and can be offered the option of transferring one or two embryos. When a couple has high-quality embryos available for transfer on day 5 and they are offered the options of transferring one embryo with a 50% expectation for pregnancy (almost all singles) or two embryos with an 75% expectation for pregnancy (about 38% twins, 60% single, and 2% triplets), most couples choose to transfer two embryos. This is  after counseling them about the medical risks involved for mother and babies with multiple pregnancies. They want the higher chance for pregnancy and are accepting (sometimes even welcoming) the risks that are involved with a multiple pregnancy. Those who choose to have a single embryo transferred usually have insurance coverage for IVF or have at least one child already.      What is blastocyst culture and transfer?  A blastocyst is an embryo that has developed for 5 to 7 days after fertilization and has just started to differentiate. It has developed two different cell types and a central cavity. One group of cells will become the placenta, and the other group will become the fetus. A healthy blastocyst will begin hatching from its outer shell by the sixth or seventh day. Shortly after hatching from the shell, it should begin to implant into the lining of the mother's uterus. In past years, the majority of embryo transfers were done on day 3 (after the egg retrieval) at the "cleavage stage" when the embryos have four to eight cells. One problem with this is that day 3 embryos normally are found in the fallopian tubes, not in the uterus. The embryo first moves into the uterus at about 80 hours after ovulation. The embryo implantation process begins about 3 days later, after blastocyst formation and hatching have occurred. The other problem with transferring on day 3 is that many embryos at that stage do not have the capacity to continue development and become high-quality blastocysts. We do not have reliable methods to determine which of the day 3 embryos will be viable long-term. Therefore, the tendency has been to transfer more embryos on day 3 in an attempt to achieve good pregnancy rates. When embryos are cultured from day 3 to day 5, some will stop developing and others (usually 25% to 60%) will continue to become blastocysts. Therefore, by choosing the best blastocysts for transfer on day 5, we can choose much more reliably those with the best potential for implanting and making a baby. In the past it was difficult to get good numbers of high-quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems. However, advanced culture media have been developed that provide the proper balance of nutrients at the various stages of early embryo development. Proper culture techniques with these new media formulations yield excellent blastocyst formation rates. This makes blastocyst transfer a viable option for some couples with infertility. Some programs are doing all IVF cases with day 5 transfers. One of the issues with this is that a small proportion of couples will have embryos that are growing on day 3, but by day 5, all of their embryos have stopped developing. These patients could have had a day 3 embryo transfer, but because their embryos were kept in culture and arrested after day 3, they will not have an embryo transfer at all. This has been reported to occur in about 5% of cases if all patient's embryos are cultured for 5 days. The ultimate outcome of the cycle might be exactly the same either way (a failed cycle), but many couples would  prefer to have an embryo transfer and then not be pregnant as opposed to being called and told that their embryos have stopped developing and therefore they will not have an embryo transfer procedure. Our IVF program and many others perform blastocyst transfers in selected cases. Most IVF centers (including ours) that perform day 5 transfers have selection criteria for deciding which cases are transferred on day 3 versus day 5. The criteria often involve a minimum number of fertilized eggs or a minimum number of embryos that are still developing on day 3. In our IVF program, we (currently - 2017) usually perform day 3 transfers for couples (female age under 37) with less than 3 day 3 embryos, and do day 5 transfers for couples with 3 or more  day 3 embryos. This has been working well for us with rare cases having no embryos available for transfer on day 5. Individual factors are often important in making this decision, such as:   Age of the female partner  Information from previous IVF cycles  The planned number of embryos to be transferred to the uterus (1, 2 or 3)  Whether preimplantation genetic screening is desired by the couple         Do blastocyst transfers correlate with higher pregnancy rates than day 3 transfers?   Yes, in most published studies, and in the experience of many IVF programs, pregnancy rates are higher with blastocyst transfers when a given number of embryos are transferred (e.g. two). This is because of the higher potential for implantation of the blastocyst. However, the issue is complicated because some IVF centers have seen no improvement or even lower pregnancy rates with blastocyst transfers. This is because blastocyst culture and transfer is technically more complicated and difficult as compared to day 3 transfer. Some laboratories are not able to maintain the stable and exacting culture environment for 5 days that allows the optimal development of the embryos. Therefore, it is not surprising that extended culture and transfer of two embryos on day 5 can show excellent pregnancy rates in some centers and significantly lower results in others. This concept is well-understood in the embryology world, but it is not widely discussed in public forums.      How can blastocyst transfer benefit couples needing IVF?  Because blastocysts have a significantly higher implantation potential than day 3 embryos, the physician can transfer only two embryos and keep pregnancy rates high (over 50% per egg retrieval procedure in some programs for women under age 40) and triplet pregnancy rates down in the 2% to 4% range (one of the two embryos can split into identical twins to make triplets). Transferring only two embryos on day 3 results (on average) in an even lower rate of twin and triplet pregnancies (a good thing), but this happens at the cost of a lower overall pregnancy rate. Because of the high implantation potential of blastocyst embryos, we should be cautious about the high potential for twins. Transfer of two good looking blastocysts can result in twin pregnancy rates as high as 50%. Therefore, transferring only one should be considered in young women (or in egg donation cycles) with high-quality blastocysts. Pregnancy rates with single embryo transfer (SET) in these patients can be in the 40-60% range in good IVF programs with a very low risk of twins (about 2% due to embryo splitting - identical twins).  How can PGS testing benefit couples needing IVF?   When we screen embryos prior to the transfer with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) we see excellent pregnancy and live birth success rates after transfer of a single embryo when it has normal PGS results. We now have years of experience with doing this for couples that choose to have it.   Conclusions  Blastocyst culture and transfer of one or two embryos in IVF centers that are proficient with this technique currently offers the best balance between the chances of having any pregnancy and the risks of  multiple pregnancy.  The decision to transfer one or 2 (or more) should be based on the age of the female , the morphology grading of the blastocysts and the history of their previous IVF treatments.  Doing PGS screening on blastocysts and then transferring a single embryo is currently the state of the art for IVF. It provides a high probability for a healthy outcome for mother and baby and reduces miscarriage risk.

In Vitro Fertilization Gives Two Sets of Identical Twins to Couple     By Mikaela Conley  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Mikaela   April 12, 2011   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play J Kent Photography WATCH 2 Sets of Twins for North Carolina Couple  0 Shares               Email      "Babies, babies, babies." That's how Miranda and Josh Crawford now describe a typical day after their two sets of identical twins -- quadruplets in all -- joined their two-year-old sister in February. After trying to get pregnant for more than a year, Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, of Charlotte, N.C., turned to artificial insemination, and then in vitro fertilization, to have their first daughter. Doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and one survived. On March 17, 2009, Miranda gave birth to Baby Joslyn. But Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, both registered nurses, hoped to eventually expand their family over time to three or four children. A year later, the couple sought out in vitro fertilization for a second time. Again, doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and, just six weeks into the pregnancy, doctors told the couple that they would be having twins. But the ultrasound was fuzzy, and both the doctor and Miranda wanted to confirm how many babies were growing in her belly. She returned to the hospital four days later. This time, the ultrasound was clear -- there were four hearts beating on the screen, not two. "I was shocked, the doctor was shocked," Miranda said. "Never had that happened in his entire career." Typically one or two embryos are inserted into a woman's uterus during one round of IVF. Even then, the patient has about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all. But both embryos had split in Miranda's uterus to create two sets of identical twins. "For a woman who is less than 35 years old, it is recommended that one or two embryos be transferred into the uterus during a fresh IVF cycle," said Dr. Jani Jensen, a physician in the department of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Mayo Clinic. "In this case, it appears that the guidelines were correctly followed, but that lightning struck twice." After shock, Miranda said fear stepped in. The couple was aware of the risk and complications that come with multiple births.  A Risky Pregnancy  "The whole pregnancy was scary," Miranda said. "I wasn't sure if I was going to have a miscarriage, and I was always thinking that I could go into preterm labor at any moment." "We took it day by day," said Josh.  Rare Situation Surprises IVF Experts  "This is certainly an unusual outcome," Jensen said. "I've never seen it happen quite like this." Jensen said she has rarely seen embryos split, but doctors estimate that it can happen in a little more than 1 percent of IVF cycles, and slightly more if the embryos are transferred as blastocysts, or embryos that have developed longer outside the body. "The math here is mind-boggling: the patient likely only had about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all, and with that, we expect that at least half of the time when two embryos are placed in the uterus, only one will continue to develop, so even twins are more of the exception, not the rule," Jensen said. "To have both embryos implant and both undergo the rare phenomenon of splitting is extremely unusual," Jensen continued. "There are a few reports of this happening worldwide, but overall, it's a rarity." Only 2 percent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins. Dr. James Grifo, director of the NYU Fertility Center, broke down the math. "Embryo splitting occurs approximately in one out of 100 embryo transfers," Grifo said. "The chance of this outcome is approximately one in 10,000. This could also occur in a natural conception, but the chance of that is much [rarer]. "We have done around 20,000 IVF cycles and have fortunately not seen this outcome," he said. "It represents a very risky obstetrical situation, but it sounds like they were fortunate and had a good outcome." "This is so rare, it is almost a record," said Dr. Michelle Warren, medical director for the Center for Menopause, Hormonal Disorders and Women's Health in New York. "However there is a view that only one embryo should be implanted at a time, particularly in patients with proven success. The issue is cost and if IVF wasn't so expensive, this would undoubtedly be standard of care."  One, No More Than Two Embryos  Warren said many European countries do not allow more than one embryo at a time because of the high risk and cost of multiple pregnancies, along with health problems with the babies. Identical twins following IVF tend to share a placenta and one of the pregnancy membranes, which makes the twin pregnancy riskier in terms of harsh growth conditions and death in the womb for one of the twins. The risk of preterm labor and delivery is very high with any sort of multiple births. Babies born premature are at an increased risk for many health complications, including learning disabilities, lung problems, cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness. Because the pregnancy was so high-risk, doctors gave the Crawfords several options, including reduction, where one or some of the fetuses are aborted for the safety of the mother and the other growing babies. The Crawfords said they never considered reduction.  Overall Healthy Pregnancy  Miranda developed gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, which she managed by controlling and restricting her diet. "My sugars were very low, but it only lasted a little while," she said. "It worked itself out before the babies came." She was also hospitalized twice in December when doctors feared she might go into preterm labor. But for the circumstance, the couple said the pregnancy went very well, considering the risk. Doctors put Miranda on strict bed rest in December. By the time she was ready to give birth, she had gained 60 pounds and her midsection measured in at five feet around. "Even at 20 weeks, I looked like I was nine months pregnant," said Miranda. "I was huge."  Babies, Babies, Babies  Mia, Madison, Jackson and James were born on Feb. 4, 2010, 34 weeks into Miranda's pregnancy. "They were all healthy, between four and a half and five and one-half pounds," Josh said. The babies spent three weeks in the neonatal ICU so doctors could monitor their feeding toleration. By Feb. 28, the brood arrived at home, expanding the family of three to seven.  Five Babies: Teamwork  Miranda and Josh said that it's all about the teamwork when caring for the babies, and keeping the infants on the same eat-sleep rotation is key. "They've gained the weight they've needed to gain, and now they can sleep as long as they want at night," Miranda said. Usually, the babies are up every three to four hours. After their morning feeding, Miranda said she bathes them, gets them dressed, gives a second feeding, changes them for the afternoon and puts them in their sleepers at night. Miranda breastfeeds two at a time while Josh bottle-feeds the other two babies. After having eight weeks off from work to care for the babies, Josh is back to work for the first time this week. "I might not get a bath or get dressed, but the babies do," Miranda said. "This case shows that nature is always ready to show doctors that we can't control everything," said Dr. Richard Paulson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. "As much as we try to avoid high-order multiple gestations by replacing fewer and fewer embryos, every once in a while, nature reminds us that we are not in charge."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Video of Dr. Silber discussing Egg and Ovary Banking to Preserve Fertility   Whenever IVF or ICSI is performed, embryos may be cultured for either one day, two days, or even five days, before transferring them back into the woman. In order to culture the embryos for five days, i.e. to what we call the “blastocyst” stage, you need to use “sequential” culture media systems. We have used such a system since the summer of 1997 because it gives us the option of culturing the embryos for as long as is clinically appropriate for each particular patient’s situation.  However, there is a great deal of debate, and some considerable commercial hype, centering around whether to culture for two days, three days, or five or six days. The media we use, and which many other of the best programs use, allows us to culture the embryos to whatever number of days is appropriate for the particular patient. Since this media is commonly available, it should not be used to hype any particular program.  For some patients with poor quality embryo development (a condition which is programmed into the genome of many infertile women), even with the best culture media, the embryos may be better off going directly into the fallopian tube immediately. For the average patient, day two or day three transfer either to the fallopian tube or to the uterus may be best. For some patients, day 5 transfer to the uterus may be a good option. The problem with extended culture to day 5 is that there may be a loss of some embryos that might have “made it” if they had been transferred earlier.

The problem with extended culture to day 5 is that there may be a loss of some embryos that might have “made it” if they had been transferred earlier.   A well-developed 5-day blastocyst.  The major advantage (despite the already mentioned disadvantage) of day 5 transfer is embryo selection. The implantation rate per day 5 blastocyst transfer is greater than for transfer of day 2 or 3 embryos. But only 20 percent to 50 percent of day 2 embryos can develop in vitro to day five no matter how perfect the in vitro culture system. There is a potential loss therefore of what could have been viable embryos. So selection is the only advantage of blastocyst culture, and this selection has nothing to do with the “quality” of the baby, but rather just whether the embryo “makes it” or not to becoming a baby.  Either way, because our system of embryo freezing is so good, we do not lose anything if we transfer less embryos to reduce your risk of triplets or quadruplets, and just save the extra embryos for a later pregnancy. We can even transfer just one embryo at a time (if that is your wish) without at all reducing your chance of pregnancy.  Therefore, hype should be removed from this issue, and decisions should be made that are in the best interest of the particular patient’s situation.  Nonetheless we believe that use of sequential culture media, as we routinely do, is an advantage, in that patients can have the option of prolonged embryo culture if that is in their best interest.

Published on March 14, 2017 by SCRC Contributor   Share this on social media:                         From the moment Beyonce Knowles announced that she and her husband were expecting twins, the media began speculating whether her multiple pregnancy may be the result of IVF. The couple has never commented on whether they sought assistance from fertility experts when they decided to grow their family, and their privacy is to be respected. Beyond the realm of celebrity gossip, however, the rumours have created an opportunity to discuss common misunderstandings about IVF and multiple births.   Does IVF cause twins?  The short answer to this question is no. The process of IVF , in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to a substantially higher risk of multiple pregnancy. In practice, the answer is slightly more nuanced. Statistically, women who undergo IVF have multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples) at a higher rate than women who conceived naturally: According to statistics published in 2013, around 40% of all IVF pregnancies in the US resulted in multiple births. That is a concerning percentage, especially when compared to the natural occurrence rate of 2% in the general population.  The main reason for this is the practice of transferring more than one embryo at a time in an IVF cycle. Until recently, most fertility doctors routinely transferred multiple embryos in the hope of achieving a better chance of success. The reason for this is that many embryos have chromosomal abnormalities which mean they are not actually viable. This is true whether the embryos are conceived naturally or through IVF. Because egg quality tends to decline over the years, the proportion of abnormal embryos generally goes up as a woman ages. Placing two or more embryos into the uterus at a time was thought to increase pregnancy rates, with the hope that at least one would survive. Quite often, more than one embryo will successfully implant, resulting in a multiple pregnancy.  What are the risks of multiple pregnancy and birth?  Twins or triplets are often a cause for joy, especially if you have waited a long time for a baby. The dream of "two for the price of one" may be extremely attractive as you face the physical, emotional, and financial investment of undergoing IVF. The reality, however, is that a multiple pregnancy carries considerably higher risks for both mother and babies. Pregnancy complications occur at a significantly higher rate in multiple pregnancies, including:   Preeclampsia  Gestational diabetes  Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)  Placental abruption  Fetal demise/loss   The birth itself can also present dangers such as:   Higher rates of Cesarean birth  Preterm labor/deliver  Low birth weights   The long-term health complications for preemies and low birthweight babies can be serious, and in some cases, life-altering. Most multiple pregnancies can be safely managed with close monitoring by your medical team, but doctors take these additional health risks seriously, and generally prefer to do what they can to make it less likely that an IVF cycle will result in a multiple pregnancy.  How can I minimize my risk of having twins?  Most leading fertility experts now consider elective single embryo transfer (eSET) to be best practice for most IVF cycles. You may have produced a large number of eggs during the ovarian stimulation process, and may have a number of viable embryos available, and your doctor may still suggest that you transfer only one (freezing the rest for any future IVF cycles.) There are several reasons for this:   Technology has made it easier to select a high quality embryo for transfer.   New developments in embryology have made it possible for experts to identify which embryos have the highest likelihood of success. This is reassuring to many patients. The ability to choose a high quality embryo takes away a little of the emotional pressure you may feel at the thought of transferring "only one."   Genetic testing.   Sophisticated genetic tests such as preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) mean that the lab can pinpoint the type of genetic abnormalities that often cause miscarriage. These tests are quite safe and can be performed with minimal risk to the embryo. PGS screens for aneuploidies, which are missing or translocated ("scrambled") chromosomes. PGD allows embryologists to get a complete picture of an embryo's chromosomal makeup, and is often used to ensure that the embryos are free of specific serious genetic conditions such as Tay Sachs Disease or cystic fibrosis.   Time lapse-photography   The Embryoscope is a cutting-edge incubator which makes it much easier for the lab to choose the healthiest available embryo for transfer. It does this in a few ways. First, a time-lapse camera takes photographs of the culturing embryos every five minutes, combining them together into mini movies for the expert to watch. This allows the lab to monitor the growth and development of the embryos without ever removing them from the ideal environment of the incubator. This cuts down on any potential exposure to harmful substances in the air or changes of light and temperature which could be a risk to a developing embryo.  The other benefit of this close monitoring is the ability to compare an embryo's rate of development to an enormous database. Machine-learning algorithms are combing through the data, and can point out the timing of crucial moments in development (such as cell splitting) which correlate to a positive or negative outcome. This is another way for the lab to discover which embryos have the best chance of resulting in a healthy pregnancy.   Blastocyst transfer.   Standard IVF practice has been to transfer embryos after about 3 days culture in the lab, but increasingly doctors and patients are opting for blastocyst transfer instead. A blastocyst is an embryo which has been incubated in the lab to the "blastocyst stage" which occurs 5 to 6 days after fertilization. Advances in lab technology, such as better culture mediums, have now made it possible to keep embryos healthy in the lab for that long. This has some unique benefits which are likely to contribute to a higher success rate.   The extra time allows the lab to identify the unhealthy embryos which are unable to reach the blastocyst stage, making it less likely that an unhealthy embryo will be implanted.  In natural conception, a 3 day old embryo would still be in the environment of the fallopian tube, not the uterus. Waiting until it is 5 to 6 days old allows the transfer to be performed in "perfect timing," as this is the stage at which the embryo is ready to implant in the lining of the uterus.    Transferring one embryo is as likely to result in pregnancy as a multiple transfer.   A recent study took a look at whether the number of embryos transferred in an IVF cycle had an effect on the live birth rate. Their analysis showed  "little to no effect on clinic-level live birth rates with increasing rates of eSET." The percentage of multiple births dropped with eSET, but the percentage of live births did not.   IVF may actually have a higher chance of success with just one embryo.   Another study discovered that transferring two embryos can reduce a patient's chance of pregnancy by almost a quarter, if one of the embryos was of lower quality. This is a particularly important point. Before transfer, all the available 3 day embryos which resulted from the IVF cycle are graded according to quality, ranging from 1 (the best, with all cells of equal size and no sign of fragmentation) down to 5 (the least promising grade, where cells may be uneven in size and there may be moderate to heavy fragmentation.) Generally, the higher an embryo's grade, the better its chances of implantation. When doctors transfer multiple embryos, they generally select the highest-quality available, but this may mean a variety of grades. What the study found was that instead of increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, the poorer-quality embryo may actually compromise the pregnancy. The results of the study revealed that when compared to eSET, a two embryo transfer with one good quality embryo and one poor quality embryo resulted in a 27% lower pregnancy rate. The researchers suspect that the poor quality embryo may cause the body to reject the pregnancy at the expense of the healthy embryo.   Every IVF cycle is unique, and there is no one answer that is right for everyone. You and your doctor will be able to assess the risks and weigh the benefits of eSET vs multiple transfer in your case. There are some cases where fertility doctors may still choose to transfer more than one embryo,often in cases where a patient is older and has had multiple failed attempts. If that does result in a multiple pregnancy, a good Los Angeles fertility clinic can keep a close eye on you during your early weeks and help you transfer your care to an obstetrician with experience handling higher-risk care such as multiples. No matter what, the end goal is always a healthy mother and a healthy baby (or two) at the end of your pregnancy.

They may think; "we want kids, and all this treatment is expensive and unpleasant, so let's just have 2 kids and get it over with". When they are fully aware of the risks to the children if delivery is premature, some couples no longer prefer a multiple pregnancy. However, after full disclosure of the risks, many couples still hope for twins. Of course, they are also hoping that their children will be perfectly healthy. The psychological, social, and economic stresses involved with caring for twins is substantial, but patients often say they would welcome facing those stresses if they were so blessed. The risks of a multiple pregnancy are high. These expectant mothers face an increased risk for developing complications of pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, hemorrhage, and other complications. The risks to the fetuses and children are mostly related to premature delivery and can be very severe. Compared to a singleton, a twin is about five times more likely to die in the first year of life. For a triplet, this risk is about 13 times that of a singleton. The risk of having a lifelong handicap (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) is increased about 10 times for twins compared to singles, and these risks are substantially higher for triplets. Quadruplet and other high-order pregnancies are much riskier. Fortunately, with current embryo transfer policies, pregnancies beyond triplets are rare with IVF.      Statistics about the number of embryos transferred and multiple pregnancies  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) gather, tabulate, and publish annual national summaries and clinic-specific reports of IVF statistics.   These reports cover live birth rates, twin and triplet rates, the average number of embryos transferred per patient and other variables   The report for IVF cycles in 2015 is currently available  on the SART website, the CDC report lags behind the SART report - 2015 preliminary data is the most recent available from CDC.   Links to the SART and CDC reports   These annual reports show the trend in the United States toward transferring fewer embryos.   In 1997, the average number of embryos transferred to women under 35 was 3.7  By 2000, it was down to 2.9  Over the same time period, there was a significant increase in the overall live birth rates for IVF procedures  At the same time, the percentage of births that were triplets or more dropped from about 14% to about 9%  However, over the same period of time, no progress was made with regard to reducing the rate of twin pregnancies, which remained at about 32% of births.  Over that 4-year period, US IVF centers transferred less embryos, resulting in higher success rates, a lower percentage of triplets, but no change in the percentage of twins.   In general, European infertility clinics are transferring fewer embryos as compared to American IVF centers. On average, they have lower pregnancy rates and a lower percentage of multiple births than clinics in the United States. There are several factors involved in this difference. In some European countries, physicians are restricted by law so that they cannot transfer more than two embryos. Also, IVF is more commonly paid for by insurance or socialized medical systems in Europe. In the United States, couples with insurance coverage for IVF services are more likely to prefer fewer embryos for transfer. By comparison, couples who must pay out of pocket for IVF often request that more embryos be transferred. They tend to be fearful of failure because of the high financial costs associated with repeating the IVF process.       What is the appropriate number of embryos to transfer?   In 2017, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART published revised guidelines regarding the appropriate maximum number of embryos to transfer. The ASRM guidelines suggest a maximum number of embryos to transfer based on the day of transfer (cleavage stage vs. blast), "prognosis category" (favorable vs. all others), whether preimplantation genetic screening was done to screen out chromosomally abnormal embryos, and female age .   Current ASRM - SART guidelines on maximum number of embryos to transfer (updated 2017)     Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Cleavage-stage Embryos (day 2 or day 3 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  3  4    All others  2  3  4  5    Euploid  1  1  1  1       Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Blastocyst Embryos (day 5 or day 6 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  2  3    All others  2  2  3  3    Euploid  1  1  1  1     The ASRM identifies the following characteristics as being associated with a "more favorable prognosis":   First cycle of IVF  Good embryo quality by morphology grading criteria  Excess embryos available for freezing  Having a previous successful IVF cycle    These guidelines have been helpful in limiting the number of embryos transferred, particularly in patients with the most favorable prognosis. However, many couples in the other categories who choose to have more than two transferred could still be at high risk for multiples, including triplets. Also, patients with embryos that have a high potential for implantation might have a high risk of twins if they have two transferred. Couples with a very high chance for pregnancy can be identified on the day of embryo transfer and can be offered the option of transferring one or two embryos. When a couple has high-quality embryos available for transfer on day 5 and they are offered the options of transferring one embryo with a 50% expectation for pregnancy (almost all singles) or two embryos with an 75% expectation for pregnancy (about 38% twins, 60% single, and 2% triplets), most couples choose to transfer two embryos. This is  after counseling them about the medical risks involved for mother and babies with multiple pregnancies. They want the higher chance for pregnancy and are accepting (sometimes even welcoming) the risks that are involved with a multiple pregnancy. Those who choose to have a single embryo transferred usually have insurance coverage for IVF or have at least one child already.      What is blastocyst culture and transfer?  A blastocyst is an embryo that has developed for 5 to 7 days after fertilization and has just started to differentiate. It has developed two different cell types and a central cavity. One group of cells will become the placenta, and the other group will become the fetus. A healthy blastocyst will begin hatching from its outer shell by the sixth or seventh day. Shortly after hatching from the shell, it should begin to implant into the lining of the mother's uterus. In past years, the majority of embryo transfers were done on day 3 (after the egg retrieval) at the "cleavage stage" when the embryos have four to eight cells. One problem with this is that day 3 embryos normally are found in the fallopian tubes, not in the uterus. The embryo first moves into the uterus at about 80 hours after ovulation. The embryo implantation process begins about 3 days later, after blastocyst formation and hatching have occurred. The other problem with transferring on day 3 is that many embryos at that stage do not have the capacity to continue development and become high-quality blastocysts. We do not have reliable methods to determine which of the day 3 embryos will be viable long-term. Therefore, the tendency has been to transfer more embryos on day 3 in an attempt to achieve good pregnancy rates. When embryos are cultured from day 3 to day 5, some will stop developing and others (usually 25% to 60%) will continue to become blastocysts. Therefore, by choosing the best blastocysts for transfer on day 5, we can choose much more reliably those with the best potential for implanting and making a baby. In the past it was difficult to get good numbers of high-quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems. However, advanced culture media have been developed that provide the proper balance of nutrients at the various stages of early embryo development. Proper culture techniques with these new media formulations yield excellent blastocyst formation rates. This makes blastocyst transfer a viable option for some couples with infertility. Some programs are doing all IVF cases with day 5 transfers. One of the issues with this is that a small proportion of couples will have embryos that are growing on day 3, but by day 5, all of their embryos have stopped developing. These patients could have had a day 3 embryo transfer, but because their embryos were kept in culture and arrested after day 3, they will not have an embryo transfer at all. This has been reported to occur in about 5% of cases if all patient's embryos are cultured for 5 days. The ultimate outcome of the cycle might be exactly the same either way (a failed cycle), but many couples would  prefer to have an embryo transfer and then not be pregnant as opposed to being called and told that their embryos have stopped developing and therefore they will not have an embryo transfer procedure. Our IVF program and many others perform blastocyst transfers in selected cases. Most IVF centers (including ours) that perform day 5 transfers have selection criteria for deciding which cases are transferred on day 3 versus day 5. The criteria often involve a minimum number of fertilized eggs or a minimum number of embryos that are still developing on day 3. In our IVF program, we (currently - 2017) usually perform day 3 transfers for couples (female age under 37) with less than 3 day 3 embryos, and do day 5 transfers for couples with 3 or more  day 3 embryos. This has been working well for us with rare cases having no embryos available for transfer on day 5. Individual factors are often important in making this decision, such as:   Age of the female partner  Information from previous IVF cycles  The planned number of embryos to be transferred to the uterus (1, 2 or 3)  Whether preimplantation genetic screening is desired by the couple         Do blastocyst transfers correlate with higher pregnancy rates than day 3 transfers?   Yes, in most published studies, and in the experience of many IVF programs, pregnancy rates are higher with blastocyst transfers when a given number of embryos are transferred (e.g. two). This is because of the higher potential for implantation of the blastocyst. However, the issue is complicated because some IVF centers have seen no improvement or even lower pregnancy rates with blastocyst transfers. This is because blastocyst culture and transfer is technically more complicated and difficult as compared to day 3 transfer. Some laboratories are not able to maintain the stable and exacting culture environment for 5 days that allows the optimal development of the embryos. Therefore, it is not surprising that extended culture and transfer of two embryos on day 5 can show excellent pregnancy rates in some centers and significantly lower results in others. This concept is well-understood in the embryology world, but it is not widely discussed in public forums.      How can blastocyst transfer benefit couples needing IVF?  Because blastocysts have a significantly higher implantation potential than day 3 embryos, the physician can transfer only two embryos and keep pregnancy rates high (over 50% per egg retrieval procedure in some programs for women under age 40) and triplet pregnancy rates down in the 2% to 4% range (one of the two embryos can split into identical twins to make triplets). Transferring only two embryos on day 3 results (on average) in an even lower rate of twin and triplet pregnancies (a good thing), but this happens at the cost of a lower overall pregnancy rate. Because of the high implantation potential of blastocyst embryos, we should be cautious about the high potential for twins. Transfer of two good looking blastocysts can result in twin pregnancy rates as high as 50%. Therefore, transferring only one should be considered in young women (or in egg donation cycles) with high-quality blastocysts. Pregnancy rates with single embryo transfer (SET) in these patients can be in the 40-60% range in good IVF programs with a very low risk of twins (about 2% due to embryo splitting - identical twins).  How can PGS testing benefit couples needing IVF?   When we screen embryos prior to the transfer with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) we see excellent pregnancy and live birth success rates after transfer of a single embryo when it has normal PGS results. We now have years of experience with doing this for couples that choose to have it.   Conclusions  Blastocyst culture and transfer of one or two embryos in IVF centers that are proficient with this technique currently offers the best balance between the chances of having any pregnancy and the risks of  multiple pregnancy.  The decision to transfer one or 2 (or more) should be based on the age of the female , the morphology grading of the blastocysts and the history of their previous IVF treatments.  Doing PGS screening on blastocysts and then transferring a single embryo is currently the state of the art for IVF. It provides a high probability for a healthy outcome for mother and baby and reduces miscarriage risk.

One of the first questions we’re asked by couples looking into in vitro fertilization (IVF) is, “Won’t IVF increase our chances of having twins or triplets?” The answer to this is, “that all depends.” According to The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology :  Multiple births are much more common today than they were in the past. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the twin birth rate has increased by over 75% since 1980, and triplet, quadruplet, and high-order multiple births have increased at an even higher rate. There are more multiple births today in part because more women are receiving infertility treatment…  With IVF, you and your doctor determine how many embryos will be transferred into your uterus . If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be rare for you to have twins or triplets. There is the possibility that the embryo could split resulting in twins. However, there is no guarantee your embryo will successfully implant into the uterine lining the first time around. This is why many women, especially those who are unable to afford two or more cycles, often opt to have more than one embryo transferred. Interestingly, the chances of a live birth from multiple embryo transfers increase only slightly compared with a single embryo transfer, although your chances of a multiple birth increase significantly. Age, physical health and embryo viability play a large part in the success of IVF cycles.  Multiple Births Are Higher Risk for Both Mothers and Babies  There are several reasons why pregnancies involving multiples post a higher risk for mothers and babies. It is harder on a female’s body to carry more than one baby so women who are pregnant with twins, triplets or higher numbers of multiples are at greater risk for preeclampsia, placental issues and diabetes. Also, multiple babies are rarely born full-term, which means your baby is at higher risk for the health complications associated with premature birth.  Consider the following statistics regarding multiple births and their average gestation (full-term singleton babies are typically born between 37 – 42 weeks and weigh 7.3 lbs).   Twins: 35 weeks              1 lbs  Triplets: 32 weeks              7 lbs.  Quadruplets: 30 weeks              9 lbs.   Premature babies are 50% more likely to experience respiratory distress. Additional complications like brain damage, cerebral palsy, and other disabilities are more likely for babies who are part of a set of twins, triplets or quadruplets. While we don’t share this information to scare you, it is important that you realize the risks involved when you opt to transfer multiple embryos.  To prevent parents from feeling pressure to implant multiple embryos in an attempt to have a live birth from their first IVF cycle, the March of Dimes Foundation has recently published an encouraging article in the Fertility and Sterility. The article advocates for systemic changes across the board, from the political and medical arenas on down to insurance funding and financing options for infertile couples so they feel less pressured to attempt multiple transfers.  If you are interested in IVF treatments and are worried about the chance of multiples, pay careful attention to the IVF success rates and statistics of the clinics you are considering. Also, remember that you are the one in control . You should never feel pressured to transfer more than one embryo is that isn’t what you want.

Maya  says:   August 30, 2016 at 8:15 pm   “If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be impossible for you to have twins or triplets. ”  Uh…no.  You can still have identical twins if the embryo splits or in a super rare instance identical triplets.  Unlikely? Yes.  Impossible? No.    Reply         Eva  says:   September 28, 2016 at 4:05 pm   @ maya, I was thinking the same thing lol    Reply         LUKE "THE TEST TUBE BABY" O'MALLEY  says:   November 4, 2016 at 1:16 pm   I AM AN IVF BABY LOLLLLLLL BUT NO TWIN SO DW GUYS THERES STILL A CHANCE YOU WON’T HAVE A TWIN    Reply         Famatta boimah  says:   March 1, 2017 at 5:46 pm   I will like to meet with the doctor for more question thanks.

What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

En español       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: August 2016     How and when will I learn whether I'm carrying twins or more?  Decades ago, most women who were pregnant with multiples didn't find out until they were in labor. But such late-term surprises are rare today. Women typically discover they're having more than one baby during an ultrasound , often in the first trimester.  If you're pregnant as a result of a fertility treatment such as Clomid , gonadotropins , or in vitro fertilization (IVF) , you'll probably have an ultrasound within the first eight weeks to count the number of embryos that have implanted. Ultrasound is almost foolproof at revealing multiple pregnancies, particularly after six to eight weeks. However, the more babies you're carrying, the easier it is for one to get overlooked.  You'll also have an early ultrasound if your healthcare provider hears more than one heartbeat with the handheld Doppler .  How do twins end up fraternal or identical?  Fraternal twins develop from two eggs that are released and fertilized at the same time by two different sperm. They're known as dizygotic (DZ). Identical twins develop from one egg that splits into two and are known as monozygotic (MZ).  Because they come from the same egg, so-called "identical" twins twins do have the same DNA. But even though they have the same genetic makeup, they're never exactly the same.  They have distinguishing physical characteristics that may allow their parents to tell them apart, possibly due to environmental influences, either inside or outside the womb. Also, certain genes may end up being expressed differently in each twin.    Live birth: Twins Follow one woman through her pregnancy with twins and watch her give birth.  How and when can I find out whether my babies are fraternal or identical twins?  An ultrasound can often tell you, based on whether there are one or two placentas and whether the babies are the same sex.  An experienced technician performing a transvaginal ultrasound between 9 and 14 weeks can determine with nearly 100 percent certainty whether your babies share a single placenta. (The accuracy rate drops to about 90 percent in the second trimester as the womb becomes more crowded.)  If your babies share a placenta, they're identical. If there are two placentas, your twins may be fraternal or identical. All fraternal twins and 20 to 30 percent of identical twins have separate placentas.  By 18 to 20 weeks, a technician may be able to identify the babies' sex, assuming that both are positioned such that the technician can get a good look at their genitals. If an ultrasound clearly shows that you have a boy and a girl, you'll know that your babies are fraternal. Identical twins are nearly always the same sex.  If the ultrasound shows two placentas and only one sex – or if the results are unclear – you may have to wait until your babies are born for your answer. After the birth, your provider will determine whether the twins shared a placenta. Because separate placentas sometimes fuse together and appear as one, a laboratory test may be needed to tell how many placentas there were.  If placental analysis doesn't solve the mystery, you can order an at-home DNA test for about $100 and get results in one to two weeks (or pay $400 for results in three days). Identical twins almost always have identical DNA, while fraternal twins share about 50 percent of their DNA.  As your babies grow up, it'll probably be easy to tell what type of twins they are just by looking at them. If they look so much alike that other people can't tell them apart, they're almost certainly identical. Any obvious difference in their hair color, eye color, or facial features means they're fraternal.  Why is it important to know whether twins are identical?  It's not simply a matter of satisfying your curiosity. It can also be important to know for medical reasons.  For one thing, identical twins who share a single placenta face a special health risk during pregnancy. Up to 15 percent of these twins will develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), a dangerous condition in which blood flows more to one twin than to the other. The twin on the receiving end tends to grow more rapidly than the donor twin.  Without treatment, the condition is usually fatal for both babies. If your twins are sharing a placenta, your healthcare provider will monitor their weight gain and watch for other signs of TTTS. If your provider suspects TTTS, prompt treatment may prevent complications and keep your babies healthy.  Even after your twins have grown up, it could be important to know whether they're identical. For example, if one twin is found to have a genetic disease, an identical sibling will have it too. A fraternal sibling, on the other hand, might be spared.  There's one more reason to find out whether your twins identical: Everyone will ask – from friends and relatives to strangers on the street.

Is it implying more women are aborting due to possible health risks? Because surely they can't prevent becoming pregnant with fraternal twins? This "rate (i.e. fraternal twins pregnancies) hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world", but then it's added that it isn't common for Hispanics and Asian people to have twins... only fraternal twins then?... Sorry, I'm also confused about large body types; if anything, I was always told it's about hormones and that, for that reason, it'd be easier for curvy women (=more estrogen) to get pregnant, not necessarily large women? In that case, there should be a large concentration of twins in central and northern Europe and the US, no?     0 out of 0 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?

I am 30 yrs old and always had slightly irregular periods. The cycles could range from 30 days to 45 days… After a couple of months of trying to conceive with my husband, my period suddenly stopped altogether for a couple of months for no reason. I tested negative on pregnancy tests. So I got 50mg of Clomid that i took for one course on cd3-7 and i immediately became pregnant with twins! My insurance didn’t cover Clomid. So I got it online (thanks google). My sister gave me the code “CLO4MULT” and she said ‘just Google it’.     1 out of 2 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?

says  I bet those same women passing judgement on another's choice to have an abortion are also the same women that would be b1tch1ng up a storm if the girl/women decided to keep the baby & had to rely on welfare & various other social services to help raise the baby. Women make the extremely difficult decision to have an abortion for various reasons & amongst those are physical/mental conditions that could make carrying the baby full time life threatening to mother &/or child. Or emotionally, like others have already said, what if the person having the abortion was a rape victim? Are you going to be ignorant enough to expect her to carry/deliver that baby full term? Adoption isn't ALWAYS the best option. Pro life people crack me up. They are the biggest hypocrites you can come across. Most often times they are for pro life for religious reasons/beliefs, yet if they were truly following their own faith most religions frown against judging others. Pro lifers are the biggest judges of them all     2 out of 3 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?  Yes | No    Thank you!

says  I recently found out I am having twins at my scheduled abortion, I was so scared going in because I didn't know how I would feel afterwards especially since this would've been my first time. But once the nurse told me I was having multiples I just couldn't do it. When I first found out I was pregnant, I asked the father "what if it's twins?" crazy how I was right but I'm not shocked at all. The father is a twin and amongst that twins run my family this would make the 7th set that we know of. Four children is going to be tough but I'll adjust.     6 out of 8 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?  Yes | No    Thank you!

Abortion is a choice and it's difficult enough on the woman as it is, let alone adding in unrelated religious rants and judging.     14 out of 20 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?

Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

It’s advice that couples tend to ignore when talking to their fertility doctor about the number of embryos to transfer during IVF. Because the cost of fertility treatment is high and is usually not covered by insurance, they hedge their bets and gamble that transferring multiple embryos will increase the chances of getting pregnant. And while stricter guidelines for embryo transfer have been successful at reducing higher order multiples (triplets or more), "the next hurdle is how do we reduce the twin rate while maintaining the same pregnancy rate?" says R. Stan Williams, MD, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART), and professor and chair of the Department of OB-GYN at the University of Florida.  Patients, however, tend to not see the risks of being pregnant with two. Michael A. Feinman, MD, Medical Director of HRC Fertility in Southern California, says some couples strongly want to transfer two embryos or actually desire twins. "Some couples think twins are 'cute,' because they do not see the ones who experience the problems of prematurity or see how difficult it is for parents to handle them.”  The Risks of Multiples  Fertility doctors and patient advocates are working to educate patients about the serious health risks and high costs of having more than one baby at the same time.  “We have to do a better job educating patients about the health risks — they are not getting these messages,” says Barbara Collura, executive director of the infertility patient advocacy group RESOLVE. “They are being told it by their doctor as part of the informed consent process. But reproductive endocrinologists — you can ask any single one of them if they ever get pressure from the patients to transfer more than the required guidelines state, and they will tell you ‘yes, every day.’”  Even though there seem to be twins everywhere these days (between 1980 and 2004, the rate of multiple births increased by 70 percent), the risks to the health and well-being of the mother and babies — and the costs to society — are quite high.  “It has been shown that twin pregnancies cost society billions of dollars each year,” Dr. Feinman says. “These costs are due to increased maternal hospitalizations to prevent prematurity, increased intensive care for the babies from prematurity, and increased rates of lifelong disabilities like cerebral palsy in twins.”  Women who are pregnant with twins are at much higher risk for pregnancy complications, including: Premature birth: About 60 percent of twins are born prematurely at an average of 35 weeks. Low birthweight: More than half of twins are born at less than 5 ½ pounds. Low birthweight babies, especially those born before 32 weeks and/or weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds, are at increased risk of health problems during the newborn period, as well as lasting disabilities such as mental retardation , cerebral palsy , and vision and hearing loss . Cesarean section: Women who carry multiples may be more likely to need Caesarean sections, which may require a longer period of recovery and at times can increase the risk of hemorrhage during and after delivery. Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS): About 10 percent of identical twins who share a placenta develop TTTS, which occurs when a connection between the two babies' blood vessels in the placenta causes one baby to get too much blood flow and the other too little. Pre-eclampsia: Women expecting twins are more than twice as likely to develop pre-eclampsia, which is a combination of high blood pressure, protein in the urine and generalized swelling that can be dangerous for mother and baby. Gestational diabetes: This pregnancy-related form of diabetes can cause the baby to grow especially large, increasing the risk of injuries to mother and baby during vaginal birth. Babies may also have breathing and other problems during the newborn period. Single Pregnancy Is Safer  Being pregnant with one child is safer, with the greatest chances for an optimal outcome.  A recent study published in BMJ (British Medical Journal) found that women who undergo IVF are almost five times more likely to give birth to a single healthy baby following a single embryo transfer (SET) when compared with women who choose to have two embryos transferred. In addition, the SET appeared to significantly increase the chances of carrying the baby to full term (37 weeks).  With medical advances, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has come a long way from the early days of transferring six embryos in the hopes of getting just one to implant. Newer techniques such as blastocyst stage culture and transfer are maximizing pregnancy rates and minimizing the risk of a multiple pregnancy. By growing embryos for five days in the laboratory and enabling them to reach the blastocyst stage of development, fertility doctors can better determine which embryos have the greatest likelihood of implantation.  Research has shown that success rates for single embryo transfer vs. double embryo transfer are similar in certain circumstances. "In a favorable patient who is having a blastocyst (Day 5 embryo) transfer, one blastocyst is an equivalent pregnancy rate to two," Dr. Williams says.  But some couples have difficulty accepting these studies, according to Dr. Feinman. "They intuitively feel that the second embryo must hedge their bet. Also, input from friends and former patients often affects their feelings.”  The most recent 2009 guidelines on embryo transfer from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART are very individualized. For example, for a woman under age 35 who is in the favorable category, the recommendation is to transfer one embryo if it is a Day 5 (blastocyst), and one to two embryos if it is a Day 3.  "The big advantage of the American system is we can look at shades of gray," Dr. Williams explains. "Depending on the patient’s age, the prognosis of the patient, and the stage of the embryo development, we can develop guidelines that are more flexible to meet the needs of the patient while trying to reduce the potential for multiples."  Every Fertility Story Is Different  In addition to fertility problems such as blocked tubes, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and her husband’s low sperm count, Petra, a former fertility patient, now 51 and the mom of 5-year-old twins, had experienced a brain abscess and surgery to repair a congenital heart defect in her early 20s. After trying to get pregnant for 15 years, she and her husband tried in vitro fertilization (IVF).  “Once we got into the surgery room the embryologist told us that we had three blastocysts,” she says. “One of them was hatching, which was excellent news. The other one also looked wonderful. However, the last one was fragmented and would not survive the freeze. We had to make the decision to either transfer the last one or discard it. Desperate for a child, we decided to transfer all three.”  With her heart problems, however, Petra could not have endured a triplet pregnancy. “In my eighth week, I had a vanishing triplet, but I always wonder: What if that had not been the case? I would have been faced with some terrible decisions that women who undergo fertility treatments do not want to make. If we had to do it again, I would have ‘discarded’ the third embryo, and I wish I would have been more informed — even fragmented blastocysts can make it."  Dr. Feinman says that when discussing how many embryos to transfer, his fertility clinic usually abides by the ASRM guidelines. However, “personal issues and embryo quality will also affect our advice. For instance, if multi-fetal reduction is not an option, we might transfer one less embryo. Conversely, if embryo quality is poor, we might discuss transferring more than the recommended number. In ideal cases, such as egg donation, single embryo transfer should be strongly considered. Most clinics doing this show very little decrease in pregnancy rates, compared to transferring two embryos. Even a small decrease in success will be balanced by the higher pregnancy loss rates and prematurity associated with twins."  Ultimately, however, the decision-making rests with the fertility patient.  Educating Fertility Patients  The high cost of fertility treatment and the lack of insurance coverage are key reasons why fertility patients tend to turn a deaf ear to the risks involved with having multiples.  According to Petra, she and her husband were advised of the medical risks, but chose to have the three embryos transferred anyway. “I couldn’t wrap my head around having one baby ... especially since I knew I would not have a chance to do another IVF. I probably would have felt different if we had fertility coverage. I know our decision to transfer more than one embryo was, unfortunately, made with our finances in mind and not based on medical facts and studies.”  One of the biggest obstacles in patient care is cost, says Collura. “We also know that patients tend to feel more pressure to transfer more embryos when they have pressures on cost — if somebody does not have insurance, and they only have $15,000, they may say, ‘Look, I only have this one shot. Transfer as many as you can.’”  Dr. Feinman has seen this many times. “Some [patients] think [having twins] is cost-effective if they are paying for their care: ‘Two for the price of one,’” he explains. “Sometimes it is hard to convince them that this is not true, since twins tend to cost much more than a frozen embryo transfer.  “In Canada and much of Europe, the government will only cover IVF if the clinic performs single embryo transfers,” he continues. “In some countries, if a non-identical twin occurs, the clinics have to pay back the government. In the U.S., insurance companies have abdicated their moral right to affect the situation by refusing to cover IVF. Ironically, they spend a lot more money on the multiple births created by IVF than they would if they covered it and helped regulate it. If our government or insurance companies ever wake up and realize this fact, there might be a move toward increased coverage with increased restrictions accompanying this coverage.”  Collura says that patients make better health care decisions when the cost pressure recedes. “There’s a lot of data out there about insurance coverage in mandated states and the reduction of multiple births in those states.”  A new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers and published in Fertility and Sterility has found that the 15 states that provide insurance coverage for infertility saw significantly lower multiple birth rates. In 2005, it was estimated that the economic impact of preterm birth was $26.2 billion nationally.  RESOLVE has worked with Shady Grove Fertility, a Maryland fertility clinic, to produce a patient education video about the risks of multiples. The video is based on a true patient story and a letter the patient wrote to Shady Grove after she had twins born at 25 weeks, specifically asking Shady Grove if they could use her story to help educate others about the risks of premature birth. The video describes how one twin had intestinal surgery and how both spent approximately seven months in a hospital.  “I am hoping that hearing a person’s story about her own experience and providing some data is going to be effective,” Collura says. “Our idea is for this to be available to any fertility clinic, anywhere in the United States. "Whatever I can do to help that patient know more and be better educated, I'm going to do that."  SART developed a national consent form for fertility clinics to use that gives very detailed risks for pregnancy with multiples.  In addition, ASRM is in the early stages of developing a video about the risks of multiples, according to Dr. Williams. "We are very interested in reducing multiple pregnancies."

But instead of stifling their apprehensions, they went public with his-and-her rants on the parenting website Babble. Under the pseudonym Albert Garland, the husband wrote , “To say we’re excited would be an exaggeration. More truthfully, we’re pissed. And terrified, and angry, and guilty, and regretful … As horrible as this might sound, we found ourselves wishing these twins away … This time around, we’re counting down — not like expected parents but like cancer patients with only months to live.”  “In my mind I had done nothing less than ruin our family,” the wife added . “The twins are coming fast, and I don’t feel a sense of joy … the new me is expecting the worst.”  Predictably, their Babble bitching sessions sparked an uproar , with readers contributing nearly 1,000 comments — many calling their views “disgusting” and “heartless” and writing that “they don’t deserve those babies.” There was the sense that these parents were inexcusably naive about IVF, a process that they should have known results in twins 20% to 30% of the time, and that the world of infertility was one in which any pregnancy, especially an IVF one, should be considered a blessing.  (MORE : Get Used to Embryo Adoption )  But the couple’s flair for the dramatic notwithstanding, their posts aren’t outrageous. They’re refreshing. This husband and wife had the courage to voice the true fears and worries that many parents think about but don’t feel welcome to express, much less post publicly for the world to see. They have a right to be disappointed, and perhaps the more they come to terms with that, the better they can get mentally prepared for the huge life change ahead of them.  In fact, once we learn a little more about the “Garlands,” their reactions seem wholly rational. The family lives in a one-bedroom apartment. After the birth of their son three years ago, the couple suffered through the baby’s horrendous colic (and ongoing sleep and behavior problems) and the mother’s postpartum depression. Then came a difficult twin pregnancy. “I can’t care for my son the way I used to: I can’t get on the floor, I can’t bend over, I can’t pick him up, I can’t run after him. The low iron and gestational diabetes only add to the fatigue … Now my husband is doing everything and running himself into the ground,” she writes. Did I mention that they live in a one-bedroom apartment?  Mr. and Mrs. Garland are legitimately concerned about how their minds, health and marriage will survive more upheaval. “My wife and I know better than to think that life with three children is going to be perfect … Our fear is not the new parent fear of the unknown. It’s the smart, informed fear of the known,” the father writes. He’s right to be nervous. Raising newborn twins is hard. Raising three boys under 5 is hard. Thankfully, amid all the online condemnation, some readers offered commiseration and tips to survive the shock.  The Garland twins are probably already here. (The father wrote his piece in April, when the boys were four months along, and the mother wrote hers in June, seven months into the pregnancy. Their posts enjoyed a new round of publicity this week.) So we don’t know the rest of the story. But we should congratulate their parents for their brutal honesty. They’ve opened the door for other parents-to-be, especially those who used IVF who could benefit from talking about their feelings, even the uglier ones. By being so bluntly realistic about it from the get-go, they’ll probably be more prepared than other couples who uncritically coo about their “bundles of joy” and then feel blindsided by the challenges they never saw coming.

They may think; "we want kids, and all this treatment is expensive and unpleasant, so let's just have 2 kids and get it over with". When they are fully aware of the risks to the children if delivery is premature, some couples no longer prefer a multiple pregnancy. However, after full disclosure of the risks, many couples still hope for twins. Of course, they are also hoping that their children will be perfectly healthy. The psychological, social, and economic stresses involved with caring for twins is substantial, but patients often say they would welcome facing those stresses if they were so blessed. The risks of a multiple pregnancy are high. These expectant mothers face an increased risk for developing complications of pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, hemorrhage, and other complications. The risks to the fetuses and children are mostly related to premature delivery and can be very severe. Compared to a singleton, a twin is about five times more likely to die in the first year of life. For a triplet, this risk is about 13 times that of a singleton. The risk of having a lifelong handicap (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) is increased about 10 times for twins compared to singles, and these risks are substantially higher for triplets. Quadruplet and other high-order pregnancies are much riskier. Fortunately, with current embryo transfer policies, pregnancies beyond triplets are rare with IVF.      Statistics about the number of embryos transferred and multiple pregnancies  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) gather, tabulate, and publish annual national summaries and clinic-specific reports of IVF statistics.   These reports cover live birth rates, twin and triplet rates, the average number of embryos transferred per patient and other variables   The report for IVF cycles in 2015 is currently available  on the SART website, the CDC report lags behind the SART report - 2015 preliminary data is the most recent available from CDC.   Links to the SART and CDC reports   These annual reports show the trend in the United States toward transferring fewer embryos.   In 1997, the average number of embryos transferred to women under 35 was 3.7  By 2000, it was down to 2.9  Over the same time period, there was a significant increase in the overall live birth rates for IVF procedures  At the same time, the percentage of births that were triplets or more dropped from about 14% to about 9%  However, over the same period of time, no progress was made with regard to reducing the rate of twin pregnancies, which remained at about 32% of births.  Over that 4-year period, US IVF centers transferred less embryos, resulting in higher success rates, a lower percentage of triplets, but no change in the percentage of twins.   In general, European infertility clinics are transferring fewer embryos as compared to American IVF centers. On average, they have lower pregnancy rates and a lower percentage of multiple births than clinics in the United States. There are several factors involved in this difference. In some European countries, physicians are restricted by law so that they cannot transfer more than two embryos. Also, IVF is more commonly paid for by insurance or socialized medical systems in Europe. In the United States, couples with insurance coverage for IVF services are more likely to prefer fewer embryos for transfer. By comparison, couples who must pay out of pocket for IVF often request that more embryos be transferred. They tend to be fearful of failure because of the high financial costs associated with repeating the IVF process.       What is the appropriate number of embryos to transfer?   In 2017, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART published revised guidelines regarding the appropriate maximum number of embryos to transfer. The ASRM guidelines suggest a maximum number of embryos to transfer based on the day of transfer (cleavage stage vs. blast), "prognosis category" (favorable vs. all others), whether preimplantation genetic screening was done to screen out chromosomally abnormal embryos, and female age .   Current ASRM - SART guidelines on maximum number of embryos to transfer (updated 2017)     Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Cleavage-stage Embryos (day 2 or day 3 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  3  4    All others  2  3  4  5    Euploid  1  1  1  1       Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Blastocyst Embryos (day 5 or day 6 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  2  3    All others  2  2  3  3    Euploid  1  1  1  1     The ASRM identifies the following characteristics as being associated with a "more favorable prognosis":   First cycle of IVF  Good embryo quality by morphology grading criteria  Excess embryos available for freezing  Having a previous successful IVF cycle    These guidelines have been helpful in limiting the number of embryos transferred, particularly in patients with the most favorable prognosis. However, many couples in the other categories who choose to have more than two transferred could still be at high risk for multiples, including triplets. Also, patients with embryos that have a high potential for implantation might have a high risk of twins if they have two transferred. Couples with a very high chance for pregnancy can be identified on the day of embryo transfer and can be offered the option of transferring one or two embryos. When a couple has high-quality embryos available for transfer on day 5 and they are offered the options of transferring one embryo with a 50% expectation for pregnancy (almost all singles) or two embryos with an 75% expectation for pregnancy (about 38% twins, 60% single, and 2% triplets), most couples choose to transfer two embryos. This is  after counseling them about the medical risks involved for mother and babies with multiple pregnancies. They want the higher chance for pregnancy and are accepting (sometimes even welcoming) the risks that are involved with a multiple pregnancy. Those who choose to have a single embryo transferred usually have insurance coverage for IVF or have at least one child already.      What is blastocyst culture and transfer?  A blastocyst is an embryo that has developed for 5 to 7 days after fertilization and has just started to differentiate. It has developed two different cell types and a central cavity. One group of cells will become the placenta, and the other group will become the fetus. A healthy blastocyst will begin hatching from its outer shell by the sixth or seventh day. Shortly after hatching from the shell, it should begin to implant into the lining of the mother's uterus. In past years, the majority of embryo transfers were done on day 3 (after the egg retrieval) at the "cleavage stage" when the embryos have four to eight cells. One problem with this is that day 3 embryos normally are found in the fallopian tubes, not in the uterus. The embryo first moves into the uterus at about 80 hours after ovulation. The embryo implantation process begins about 3 days later, after blastocyst formation and hatching have occurred. The other problem with transferring on day 3 is that many embryos at that stage do not have the capacity to continue development and become high-quality blastocysts. We do not have reliable methods to determine which of the day 3 embryos will be viable long-term. Therefore, the tendency has been to transfer more embryos on day 3 in an attempt to achieve good pregnancy rates. When embryos are cultured from day 3 to day 5, some will stop developing and others (usually 25% to 60%) will continue to become blastocysts. Therefore, by choosing the best blastocysts for transfer on day 5, we can choose much more reliably those with the best potential for implanting and making a baby. In the past it was difficult to get good numbers of high-quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems. However, advanced culture media have been developed that provide the proper balance of nutrients at the various stages of early embryo development. Proper culture techniques with these new media formulations yield excellent blastocyst formation rates. This makes blastocyst transfer a viable option for some couples with infertility. Some programs are doing all IVF cases with day 5 transfers. One of the issues with this is that a small proportion of couples will have embryos that are growing on day 3, but by day 5, all of their embryos have stopped developing. These patients could have had a day 3 embryo transfer, but because their embryos were kept in culture and arrested after day 3, they will not have an embryo transfer at all. This has been reported to occur in about 5% of cases if all patient's embryos are cultured for 5 days. The ultimate outcome of the cycle might be exactly the same either way (a failed cycle), but many couples would  prefer to have an embryo transfer and then not be pregnant as opposed to being called and told that their embryos have stopped developing and therefore they will not have an embryo transfer procedure. Our IVF program and many others perform blastocyst transfers in selected cases. Most IVF centers (including ours) that perform day 5 transfers have selection criteria for deciding which cases are transferred on day 3 versus day 5. The criteria often involve a minimum number of fertilized eggs or a minimum number of embryos that are still developing on day 3. In our IVF program, we (currently - 2017) usually perform day 3 transfers for couples (female age under 37) with less than 3 day 3 embryos, and do day 5 transfers for couples with 3 or more  day 3 embryos. This has been working well for us with rare cases having no embryos available for transfer on day 5. Individual factors are often important in making this decision, such as:   Age of the female partner  Information from previous IVF cycles  The planned number of embryos to be transferred to the uterus (1, 2 or 3)  Whether preimplantation genetic screening is desired by the couple         Do blastocyst transfers correlate with higher pregnancy rates than day 3 transfers?   Yes, in most published studies, and in the experience of many IVF programs, pregnancy rates are higher with blastocyst transfers when a given number of embryos are transferred (e.g. two). This is because of the higher potential for implantation of the blastocyst. However, the issue is complicated because some IVF centers have seen no improvement or even lower pregnancy rates with blastocyst transfers. This is because blastocyst culture and transfer is technically more complicated and difficult as compared to day 3 transfer. Some laboratories are not able to maintain the stable and exacting culture environment for 5 days that allows the optimal development of the embryos. Therefore, it is not surprising that extended culture and transfer of two embryos on day 5 can show excellent pregnancy rates in some centers and significantly lower results in others. This concept is well-understood in the embryology world, but it is not widely discussed in public forums.      How can blastocyst transfer benefit couples needing IVF?  Because blastocysts have a significantly higher implantation potential than day 3 embryos, the physician can transfer only two embryos and keep pregnancy rates high (over 50% per egg retrieval procedure in some programs for women under age 40) and triplet pregnancy rates down in the 2% to 4% range (one of the two embryos can split into identical twins to make triplets). Transferring only two embryos on day 3 results (on average) in an even lower rate of twin and triplet pregnancies (a good thing), but this happens at the cost of a lower overall pregnancy rate. Because of the high implantation potential of blastocyst embryos, we should be cautious about the high potential for twins. Transfer of two good looking blastocysts can result in twin pregnancy rates as high as 50%. Therefore, transferring only one should be considered in young women (or in egg donation cycles) with high-quality blastocysts. Pregnancy rates with single embryo transfer (SET) in these patients can be in the 40-60% range in good IVF programs with a very low risk of twins (about 2% due to embryo splitting - identical twins).  How can PGS testing benefit couples needing IVF?   When we screen embryos prior to the transfer with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) we see excellent pregnancy and live birth success rates after transfer of a single embryo when it has normal PGS results. We now have years of experience with doing this for couples that choose to have it.   Conclusions  Blastocyst culture and transfer of one or two embryos in IVF centers that are proficient with this technique currently offers the best balance between the chances of having any pregnancy and the risks of  multiple pregnancy.  The decision to transfer one or 2 (or more) should be based on the age of the female , the morphology grading of the blastocysts and the history of their previous IVF treatments.  Doing PGS screening on blastocysts and then transferring a single embryo is currently the state of the art for IVF. It provides a high probability for a healthy outcome for mother and baby and reduces miscarriage risk.

In Vitro Fertilization Gives Two Sets of Identical Twins to Couple     By Mikaela Conley  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Mikaela   April 12, 2011   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play J Kent Photography WATCH 2 Sets of Twins for North Carolina Couple  0 Shares               Email      "Babies, babies, babies." That's how Miranda and Josh Crawford now describe a typical day after their two sets of identical twins -- quadruplets in all -- joined their two-year-old sister in February. After trying to get pregnant for more than a year, Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, of Charlotte, N.C., turned to artificial insemination, and then in vitro fertilization, to have their first daughter. Doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and one survived. On March 17, 2009, Miranda gave birth to Baby Joslyn. But Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, both registered nurses, hoped to eventually expand their family over time to three or four children. A year later, the couple sought out in vitro fertilization for a second time. Again, doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and, just six weeks into the pregnancy, doctors told the couple that they would be having twins. But the ultrasound was fuzzy, and both the doctor and Miranda wanted to confirm how many babies were growing in her belly. She returned to the hospital four days later. This time, the ultrasound was clear -- there were four hearts beating on the screen, not two. "I was shocked, the doctor was shocked," Miranda said. "Never had that happened in his entire career." Typically one or two embryos are inserted into a woman's uterus during one round of IVF. Even then, the patient has about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all. But both embryos had split in Miranda's uterus to create two sets of identical twins. "For a woman who is less than 35 years old, it is recommended that one or two embryos be transferred into the uterus during a fresh IVF cycle," said Dr. Jani Jensen, a physician in the department of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Mayo Clinic. "In this case, it appears that the guidelines were correctly followed, but that lightning struck twice." After shock, Miranda said fear stepped in. The couple was aware of the risk and complications that come with multiple births.  A Risky Pregnancy  "The whole pregnancy was scary," Miranda said. "I wasn't sure if I was going to have a miscarriage, and I was always thinking that I could go into preterm labor at any moment." "We took it day by day," said Josh.  Rare Situation Surprises IVF Experts  "This is certainly an unusual outcome," Jensen said. "I've never seen it happen quite like this." Jensen said she has rarely seen embryos split, but doctors estimate that it can happen in a little more than 1 percent of IVF cycles, and slightly more if the embryos are transferred as blastocysts, or embryos that have developed longer outside the body. "The math here is mind-boggling: the patient likely only had about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all, and with that, we expect that at least half of the time when two embryos are placed in the uterus, only one will continue to develop, so even twins are more of the exception, not the rule," Jensen said. "To have both embryos implant and both undergo the rare phenomenon of splitting is extremely unusual," Jensen continued. "There are a few reports of this happening worldwide, but overall, it's a rarity." Only 2 percent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins. Dr. James Grifo, director of the NYU Fertility Center, broke down the math. "Embryo splitting occurs approximately in one out of 100 embryo transfers," Grifo said. "The chance of this outcome is approximately one in 10,000. This could also occur in a natural conception, but the chance of that is much [rarer]. "We have done around 20,000 IVF cycles and have fortunately not seen this outcome," he said. "It represents a very risky obstetrical situation, but it sounds like they were fortunate and had a good outcome." "This is so rare, it is almost a record," said Dr. Michelle Warren, medical director for the Center for Menopause, Hormonal Disorders and Women's Health in New York. "However there is a view that only one embryo should be implanted at a time, particularly in patients with proven success. The issue is cost and if IVF wasn't so expensive, this would undoubtedly be standard of care."  One, No More Than Two Embryos  Warren said many European countries do not allow more than one embryo at a time because of the high risk and cost of multiple pregnancies, along with health problems with the babies. Identical twins following IVF tend to share a placenta and one of the pregnancy membranes, which makes the twin pregnancy riskier in terms of harsh growth conditions and death in the womb for one of the twins. The risk of preterm labor and delivery is very high with any sort of multiple births. Babies born premature are at an increased risk for many health complications, including learning disabilities, lung problems, cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness. Because the pregnancy was so high-risk, doctors gave the Crawfords several options, including reduction, where one or some of the fetuses are aborted for the safety of the mother and the other growing babies. The Crawfords said they never considered reduction.  Overall Healthy Pregnancy  Miranda developed gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, which she managed by controlling and restricting her diet. "My sugars were very low, but it only lasted a little while," she said. "It worked itself out before the babies came." She was also hospitalized twice in December when doctors feared she might go into preterm labor. But for the circumstance, the couple said the pregnancy went very well, considering the risk. Doctors put Miranda on strict bed rest in December. By the time she was ready to give birth, she had gained 60 pounds and her midsection measured in at five feet around. "Even at 20 weeks, I looked like I was nine months pregnant," said Miranda. "I was huge."  Babies, Babies, Babies  Mia, Madison, Jackson and James were born on Feb. 4, 2010, 34 weeks into Miranda's pregnancy. "They were all healthy, between four and a half and five and one-half pounds," Josh said. The babies spent three weeks in the neonatal ICU so doctors could monitor their feeding toleration. By Feb. 28, the brood arrived at home, expanding the family of three to seven.  Five Babies: Teamwork  Miranda and Josh said that it's all about the teamwork when caring for the babies, and keeping the infants on the same eat-sleep rotation is key. "They've gained the weight they've needed to gain, and now they can sleep as long as they want at night," Miranda said. Usually, the babies are up every three to four hours. After their morning feeding, Miranda said she bathes them, gets them dressed, gives a second feeding, changes them for the afternoon and puts them in their sleepers at night. Miranda breastfeeds two at a time while Josh bottle-feeds the other two babies. After having eight weeks off from work to care for the babies, Josh is back to work for the first time this week. "I might not get a bath or get dressed, but the babies do," Miranda said. "This case shows that nature is always ready to show doctors that we can't control everything," said Dr. Richard Paulson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. "As much as we try to avoid high-order multiple gestations by replacing fewer and fewer embryos, every once in a while, nature reminds us that we are not in charge."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Video of Dr. Silber discussing Egg and Ovary Banking to Preserve Fertility   Whenever IVF or ICSI is performed, embryos may be cultured for either one day, two days, or even five days, before transferring them back into the woman. In order to culture the embryos for five days, i.e. to what we call the “blastocyst” stage, you need to use “sequential” culture media systems. We have used such a system since the summer of 1997 because it gives us the option of culturing the embryos for as long as is clinically appropriate for each particular patient’s situation.  However, there is a great deal of debate, and some considerable commercial hype, centering around whether to culture for two days, three days, or five or six days. The media we use, and which many other of the best programs use, allows us to culture the embryos to whatever number of days is appropriate for the particular patient. Since this media is commonly available, it should not be used to hype any particular program.  For some patients with poor quality embryo development (a condition which is programmed into the genome of many infertile women), even with the best culture media, the embryos may be better off going directly into the fallopian tube immediately. For the average patient, day two or day three transfer either to the fallopian tube or to the uterus may be best. For some patients, day 5 transfer to the uterus may be a good option. The problem with extended culture to day 5 is that there may be a loss of some embryos that might have “made it” if they had been transferred earlier.

The problem with extended culture to day 5 is that there may be a loss of some embryos that might have “made it” if they had been transferred earlier.   A well-developed 5-day blastocyst.  The major advantage (despite the already mentioned disadvantage) of day 5 transfer is embryo selection. The implantation rate per day 5 blastocyst transfer is greater than for transfer of day 2 or 3 embryos. But only 20 percent to 50 percent of day 2 embryos can develop in vitro to day five no matter how perfect the in vitro culture system. There is a potential loss therefore of what could have been viable embryos. So selection is the only advantage of blastocyst culture, and this selection has nothing to do with the “quality” of the baby, but rather just whether the embryo “makes it” or not to becoming a baby.  Either way, because our system of embryo freezing is so good, we do not lose anything if we transfer less embryos to reduce your risk of triplets or quadruplets, and just save the extra embryos for a later pregnancy. We can even transfer just one embryo at a time (if that is your wish) without at all reducing your chance of pregnancy.  Therefore, hype should be removed from this issue, and decisions should be made that are in the best interest of the particular patient’s situation.  Nonetheless we believe that use of sequential culture media, as we routinely do, is an advantage, in that patients can have the option of prolonged embryo culture if that is in their best interest.

Published on March 14, 2017 by SCRC Contributor   Share this on social media:                         From the moment Beyonce Knowles announced that she and her husband were expecting twins, the media began speculating whether her multiple pregnancy may be the result of IVF. The couple has never commented on whether they sought assistance from fertility experts when they decided to grow their family, and their privacy is to be respected. Beyond the realm of celebrity gossip, however, the rumours have created an opportunity to discuss common misunderstandings about IVF and multiple births.   Does IVF cause twins?  The short answer to this question is no. The process of IVF , in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to a substantially higher risk of multiple pregnancy. In practice, the answer is slightly more nuanced. Statistically, women who undergo IVF have multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples) at a higher rate than women who conceived naturally: According to statistics published in 2013, around 40% of all IVF pregnancies in the US resulted in multiple births. That is a concerning percentage, especially when compared to the natural occurrence rate of 2% in the general population.  The main reason for this is the practice of transferring more than one embryo at a time in an IVF cycle. Until recently, most fertility doctors routinely transferred multiple embryos in the hope of achieving a better chance of success. The reason for this is that many embryos have chromosomal abnormalities which mean they are not actually viable. This is true whether the embryos are conceived naturally or through IVF. Because egg quality tends to decline over the years, the proportion of abnormal embryos generally goes up as a woman ages. Placing two or more embryos into the uterus at a time was thought to increase pregnancy rates, with the hope that at least one would survive. Quite often, more than one embryo will successfully implant, resulting in a multiple pregnancy.  What are the risks of multiple pregnancy and birth?  Twins or triplets are often a cause for joy, especially if you have waited a long time for a baby. The dream of "two for the price of one" may be extremely attractive as you face the physical, emotional, and financial investment of undergoing IVF. The reality, however, is that a multiple pregnancy carries considerably higher risks for both mother and babies. Pregnancy complications occur at a significantly higher rate in multiple pregnancies, including:   Preeclampsia  Gestational diabetes  Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)  Placental abruption  Fetal demise/loss   The birth itself can also present dangers such as:   Higher rates of Cesarean birth  Preterm labor/deliver  Low birth weights   The long-term health complications for preemies and low birthweight babies can be serious, and in some cases, life-altering. Most multiple pregnancies can be safely managed with close monitoring by your medical team, but doctors take these additional health risks seriously, and generally prefer to do what they can to make it less likely that an IVF cycle will result in a multiple pregnancy.  How can I minimize my risk of having twins?  Most leading fertility experts now consider elective single embryo transfer (eSET) to be best practice for most IVF cycles. You may have produced a large number of eggs during the ovarian stimulation process, and may have a number of viable embryos available, and your doctor may still suggest that you transfer only one (freezing the rest for any future IVF cycles.) There are several reasons for this:   Technology has made it easier to select a high quality embryo for transfer.   New developments in embryology have made it possible for experts to identify which embryos have the highest likelihood of success. This is reassuring to many patients. The ability to choose a high quality embryo takes away a little of the emotional pressure you may feel at the thought of transferring "only one."   Genetic testing.   Sophisticated genetic tests such as preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) mean that the lab can pinpoint the type of genetic abnormalities that often cause miscarriage. These tests are quite safe and can be performed with minimal risk to the embryo. PGS screens for aneuploidies, which are missing or translocated ("scrambled") chromosomes. PGD allows embryologists to get a complete picture of an embryo's chromosomal makeup, and is often used to ensure that the embryos are free of specific serious genetic conditions such as Tay Sachs Disease or cystic fibrosis.   Time lapse-photography   The Embryoscope is a cutting-edge incubator which makes it much easier for the lab to choose the healthiest available embryo for transfer. It does this in a few ways. First, a time-lapse camera takes photographs of the culturing embryos every five minutes, combining them together into mini movies for the expert to watch. This allows the lab to monitor the growth and development of the embryos without ever removing them from the ideal environment of the incubator. This cuts down on any potential exposure to harmful substances in the air or changes of light and temperature which could be a risk to a developing embryo.  The other benefit of this close monitoring is the ability to compare an embryo's rate of development to an enormous database. Machine-learning algorithms are combing through the data, and can point out the timing of crucial moments in development (such as cell splitting) which correlate to a positive or negative outcome. This is another way for the lab to discover which embryos have the best chance of resulting in a healthy pregnancy.   Blastocyst transfer.   Standard IVF practice has been to transfer embryos after about 3 days culture in the lab, but increasingly doctors and patients are opting for blastocyst transfer instead. A blastocyst is an embryo which has been incubated in the lab to the "blastocyst stage" which occurs 5 to 6 days after fertilization. Advances in lab technology, such as better culture mediums, have now made it possible to keep embryos healthy in the lab for that long. This has some unique benefits which are likely to contribute to a higher success rate.   The extra time allows the lab to identify the unhealthy embryos which are unable to reach the blastocyst stage, making it less likely that an unhealthy embryo will be implanted.  In natural conception, a 3 day old embryo would still be in the environment of the fallopian tube, not the uterus. Waiting until it is 5 to 6 days old allows the transfer to be performed in "perfect timing," as this is the stage at which the embryo is ready to implant in the lining of the uterus.    Transferring one embryo is as likely to result in pregnancy as a multiple transfer.   A recent study took a look at whether the number of embryos transferred in an IVF cycle had an effect on the live birth rate. Their analysis showed  "little to no effect on clinic-level live birth rates with increasing rates of eSET." The percentage of multiple births dropped with eSET, but the percentage of live births did not.   IVF may actually have a higher chance of success with just one embryo.   Another study discovered that transferring two embryos can reduce a patient's chance of pregnancy by almost a quarter, if one of the embryos was of lower quality. This is a particularly important point. Before transfer, all the available 3 day embryos which resulted from the IVF cycle are graded according to quality, ranging from 1 (the best, with all cells of equal size and no sign of fragmentation) down to 5 (the least promising grade, where cells may be uneven in size and there may be moderate to heavy fragmentation.) Generally, the higher an embryo's grade, the better its chances of implantation. When doctors transfer multiple embryos, they generally select the highest-quality available, but this may mean a variety of grades. What the study found was that instead of increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, the poorer-quality embryo may actually compromise the pregnancy. The results of the study revealed that when compared to eSET, a two embryo transfer with one good quality embryo and one poor quality embryo resulted in a 27% lower pregnancy rate. The researchers suspect that the poor quality embryo may cause the body to reject the pregnancy at the expense of the healthy embryo.   Every IVF cycle is unique, and there is no one answer that is right for everyone. You and your doctor will be able to assess the risks and weigh the benefits of eSET vs multiple transfer in your case. There are some cases where fertility doctors may still choose to transfer more than one embryo,often in cases where a patient is older and has had multiple failed attempts. If that does result in a multiple pregnancy, a good Los Angeles fertility clinic can keep a close eye on you during your early weeks and help you transfer your care to an obstetrician with experience handling higher-risk care such as multiples. No matter what, the end goal is always a healthy mother and a healthy baby (or two) at the end of your pregnancy.

They may think; "we want kids, and all this treatment is expensive and unpleasant, so let's just have 2 kids and get it over with". When they are fully aware of the risks to the children if delivery is premature, some couples no longer prefer a multiple pregnancy. However, after full disclosure of the risks, many couples still hope for twins. Of course, they are also hoping that their children will be perfectly healthy. The psychological, social, and economic stresses involved with caring for twins is substantial, but patients often say they would welcome facing those stresses if they were so blessed. The risks of a multiple pregnancy are high. These expectant mothers face an increased risk for developing complications of pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, hemorrhage, and other complications. The risks to the fetuses and children are mostly related to premature delivery and can be very severe. Compared to a singleton, a twin is about five times more likely to die in the first year of life. For a triplet, this risk is about 13 times that of a singleton. The risk of having a lifelong handicap (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) is increased about 10 times for twins compared to singles, and these risks are substantially higher for triplets. Quadruplet and other high-order pregnancies are much riskier. Fortunately, with current embryo transfer policies, pregnancies beyond triplets are rare with IVF.      Statistics about the number of embryos transferred and multiple pregnancies  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) gather, tabulate, and publish annual national summaries and clinic-specific reports of IVF statistics.   These reports cover live birth rates, twin and triplet rates, the average number of embryos transferred per patient and other variables   The report for IVF cycles in 2015 is currently available  on the SART website, the CDC report lags behind the SART report - 2015 preliminary data is the most recent available from CDC.   Links to the SART and CDC reports   These annual reports show the trend in the United States toward transferring fewer embryos.   In 1997, the average number of embryos transferred to women under 35 was 3.7  By 2000, it was down to 2.9  Over the same time period, there was a significant increase in the overall live birth rates for IVF procedures  At the same time, the percentage of births that were triplets or more dropped from about 14% to about 9%  However, over the same period of time, no progress was made with regard to reducing the rate of twin pregnancies, which remained at about 32% of births.  Over that 4-year period, US IVF centers transferred less embryos, resulting in higher success rates, a lower percentage of triplets, but no change in the percentage of twins.   In general, European infertility clinics are transferring fewer embryos as compared to American IVF centers. On average, they have lower pregnancy rates and a lower percentage of multiple births than clinics in the United States. There are several factors involved in this difference. In some European countries, physicians are restricted by law so that they cannot transfer more than two embryos. Also, IVF is more commonly paid for by insurance or socialized medical systems in Europe. In the United States, couples with insurance coverage for IVF services are more likely to prefer fewer embryos for transfer. By comparison, couples who must pay out of pocket for IVF often request that more embryos be transferred. They tend to be fearful of failure because of the high financial costs associated with repeating the IVF process.       What is the appropriate number of embryos to transfer?   In 2017, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART published revised guidelines regarding the appropriate maximum number of embryos to transfer. The ASRM guidelines suggest a maximum number of embryos to transfer based on the day of transfer (cleavage stage vs. blast), "prognosis category" (favorable vs. all others), whether preimplantation genetic screening was done to screen out chromosomally abnormal embryos, and female age .   Current ASRM - SART guidelines on maximum number of embryos to transfer (updated 2017)     Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Cleavage-stage Embryos (day 2 or day 3 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  3  4    All others  2  3  4  5    Euploid  1  1  1  1       Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Blastocyst Embryos (day 5 or day 6 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  2  3    All others  2  2  3  3    Euploid  1  1  1  1     The ASRM identifies the following characteristics as being associated with a "more favorable prognosis":   First cycle of IVF  Good embryo quality by morphology grading criteria  Excess embryos available for freezing  Having a previous successful IVF cycle    These guidelines have been helpful in limiting the number of embryos transferred, particularly in patients with the most favorable prognosis. However, many couples in the other categories who choose to have more than two transferred could still be at high risk for multiples, including triplets. Also, patients with embryos that have a high potential for implantation might have a high risk of twins if they have two transferred. Couples with a very high chance for pregnancy can be identified on the day of embryo transfer and can be offered the option of transferring one or two embryos. When a couple has high-quality embryos available for transfer on day 5 and they are offered the options of transferring one embryo with a 50% expectation for pregnancy (almost all singles) or two embryos with an 75% expectation for pregnancy (about 38% twins, 60% single, and 2% triplets), most couples choose to transfer two embryos. This is  after counseling them about the medical risks involved for mother and babies with multiple pregnancies. They want the higher chance for pregnancy and are accepting (sometimes even welcoming) the risks that are involved with a multiple pregnancy. Those who choose to have a single embryo transferred usually have insurance coverage for IVF or have at least one child already.      What is blastocyst culture and transfer?  A blastocyst is an embryo that has developed for 5 to 7 days after fertilization and has just started to differentiate. It has developed two different cell types and a central cavity. One group of cells will become the placenta, and the other group will become the fetus. A healthy blastocyst will begin hatching from its outer shell by the sixth or seventh day. Shortly after hatching from the shell, it should begin to implant into the lining of the mother's uterus. In past years, the majority of embryo transfers were done on day 3 (after the egg retrieval) at the "cleavage stage" when the embryos have four to eight cells. One problem with this is that day 3 embryos normally are found in the fallopian tubes, not in the uterus. The embryo first moves into the uterus at about 80 hours after ovulation. The embryo implantation process begins about 3 days later, after blastocyst formation and hatching have occurred. The other problem with transferring on day 3 is that many embryos at that stage do not have the capacity to continue development and become high-quality blastocysts. We do not have reliable methods to determine which of the day 3 embryos will be viable long-term. Therefore, the tendency has been to transfer more embryos on day 3 in an attempt to achieve good pregnancy rates. When embryos are cultured from day 3 to day 5, some will stop developing and others (usually 25% to 60%) will continue to become blastocysts. Therefore, by choosing the best blastocysts for transfer on day 5, we can choose much more reliably those with the best potential for implanting and making a baby. In the past it was difficult to get good numbers of high-quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems. However, advanced culture media have been developed that provide the proper balance of nutrients at the various stages of early embryo development. Proper culture techniques with these new media formulations yield excellent blastocyst formation rates. This makes blastocyst transfer a viable option for some couples with infertility. Some programs are doing all IVF cases with day 5 transfers. One of the issues with this is that a small proportion of couples will have embryos that are growing on day 3, but by day 5, all of their embryos have stopped developing. These patients could have had a day 3 embryo transfer, but because their embryos were kept in culture and arrested after day 3, they will not have an embryo transfer at all. This has been reported to occur in about 5% of cases if all patient's embryos are cultured for 5 days. The ultimate outcome of the cycle might be exactly the same either way (a failed cycle), but many couples would  prefer to have an embryo transfer and then not be pregnant as opposed to being called and told that their embryos have stopped developing and therefore they will not have an embryo transfer procedure. Our IVF program and many others perform blastocyst transfers in selected cases. Most IVF centers (including ours) that perform day 5 transfers have selection criteria for deciding which cases are transferred on day 3 versus day 5. The criteria often involve a minimum number of fertilized eggs or a minimum number of embryos that are still developing on day 3. In our IVF program, we (currently - 2017) usually perform day 3 transfers for couples (female age under 37) with less than 3 day 3 embryos, and do day 5 transfers for couples with 3 or more  day 3 embryos. This has been working well for us with rare cases having no embryos available for transfer on day 5. Individual factors are often important in making this decision, such as:   Age of the female partner  Information from previous IVF cycles  The planned number of embryos to be transferred to the uterus (1, 2 or 3)  Whether preimplantation genetic screening is desired by the couple         Do blastocyst transfers correlate with higher pregnancy rates than day 3 transfers?   Yes, in most published studies, and in the experience of many IVF programs, pregnancy rates are higher with blastocyst transfers when a given number of embryos are transferred (e.g. two). This is because of the higher potential for implantation of the blastocyst. However, the issue is complicated because some IVF centers have seen no improvement or even lower pregnancy rates with blastocyst transfers. This is because blastocyst culture and transfer is technically more complicated and difficult as compared to day 3 transfer. Some laboratories are not able to maintain the stable and exacting culture environment for 5 days that allows the optimal development of the embryos. Therefore, it is not surprising that extended culture and transfer of two embryos on day 5 can show excellent pregnancy rates in some centers and significantly lower results in others. This concept is well-understood in the embryology world, but it is not widely discussed in public forums.      How can blastocyst transfer benefit couples needing IVF?  Because blastocysts have a significantly higher implantation potential than day 3 embryos, the physician can transfer only two embryos and keep pregnancy rates high (over 50% per egg retrieval procedure in some programs for women under age 40) and triplet pregnancy rates down in the 2% to 4% range (one of the two embryos can split into identical twins to make triplets). Transferring only two embryos on day 3 results (on average) in an even lower rate of twin and triplet pregnancies (a good thing), but this happens at the cost of a lower overall pregnancy rate. Because of the high implantation potential of blastocyst embryos, we should be cautious about the high potential for twins. Transfer of two good looking blastocysts can result in twin pregnancy rates as high as 50%. Therefore, transferring only one should be considered in young women (or in egg donation cycles) with high-quality blastocysts. Pregnancy rates with single embryo transfer (SET) in these patients can be in the 40-60% range in good IVF programs with a very low risk of twins (about 2% due to embryo splitting - identical twins).  How can PGS testing benefit couples needing IVF?   When we screen embryos prior to the transfer with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) we see excellent pregnancy and live birth success rates after transfer of a single embryo when it has normal PGS results. We now have years of experience with doing this for couples that choose to have it.   Conclusions  Blastocyst culture and transfer of one or two embryos in IVF centers that are proficient with this technique currently offers the best balance between the chances of having any pregnancy and the risks of  multiple pregnancy.  The decision to transfer one or 2 (or more) should be based on the age of the female , the morphology grading of the blastocysts and the history of their previous IVF treatments.  Doing PGS screening on blastocysts and then transferring a single embryo is currently the state of the art for IVF. It provides a high probability for a healthy outcome for mother and baby and reduces miscarriage risk.

One of the first questions we’re asked by couples looking into in vitro fertilization (IVF) is, “Won’t IVF increase our chances of having twins or triplets?” The answer to this is, “that all depends.” According to The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology :  Multiple births are much more common today than they were in the past. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the twin birth rate has increased by over 75% since 1980, and triplet, quadruplet, and high-order multiple births have increased at an even higher rate. There are more multiple births today in part because more women are receiving infertility treatment…  With IVF, you and your doctor determine how many embryos will be transferred into your uterus . If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be rare for you to have twins or triplets. There is the possibility that the embryo could split resulting in twins. However, there is no guarantee your embryo will successfully implant into the uterine lining the first time around. This is why many women, especially those who are unable to afford two or more cycles, often opt to have more than one embryo transferred. Interestingly, the chances of a live birth from multiple embryo transfers increase only slightly compared with a single embryo transfer, although your chances of a multiple birth increase significantly. Age, physical health and embryo viability play a large part in the success of IVF cycles.  Multiple Births Are Higher Risk for Both Mothers and Babies  There are several reasons why pregnancies involving multiples post a higher risk for mothers and babies. It is harder on a female’s body to carry more than one baby so women who are pregnant with twins, triplets or higher numbers of multiples are at greater risk for preeclampsia, placental issues and diabetes. Also, multiple babies are rarely born full-term, which means your baby is at higher risk for the health complications associated with premature birth.  Consider the following statistics regarding multiple births and their average gestation (full-term singleton babies are typically born between 37 – 42 weeks and weigh 7.3 lbs).   Twins: 35 weeks              1 lbs  Triplets: 32 weeks              7 lbs.  Quadruplets: 30 weeks              9 lbs.   Premature babies are 50% more likely to experience respiratory distress. Additional complications like brain damage, cerebral palsy, and other disabilities are more likely for babies who are part of a set of twins, triplets or quadruplets. While we don’t share this information to scare you, it is important that you realize the risks involved when you opt to transfer multiple embryos.  To prevent parents from feeling pressure to implant multiple embryos in an attempt to have a live birth from their first IVF cycle, the March of Dimes Foundation has recently published an encouraging article in the Fertility and Sterility. The article advocates for systemic changes across the board, from the political and medical arenas on down to insurance funding and financing options for infertile couples so they feel less pressured to attempt multiple transfers.  If you are interested in IVF treatments and are worried about the chance of multiples, pay careful attention to the IVF success rates and statistics of the clinics you are considering. Also, remember that you are the one in control . You should never feel pressured to transfer more than one embryo is that isn’t what you want.

Maya  says:   August 30, 2016 at 8:15 pm   “If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be impossible for you to have twins or triplets. ”  Uh…no.  You can still have identical twins if the embryo splits or in a super rare instance identical triplets.  Unlikely? Yes.  Impossible? No.    Reply         Eva  says:   September 28, 2016 at 4:05 pm   @ maya, I was thinking the same thing lol    Reply         LUKE "THE TEST TUBE BABY" O'MALLEY  says:   November 4, 2016 at 1:16 pm   I AM AN IVF BABY LOLLLLLLL BUT NO TWIN SO DW GUYS THERES STILL A CHANCE YOU WON’T HAVE A TWIN    Reply         Famatta boimah  says:   March 1, 2017 at 5:46 pm   I will like to meet with the doctor for more question thanks.

What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

How do twins end up fraternal or identical?  How and when can I find out whether my babies are fraternal or identical twins?  Why is it important to know whether twins are identical? En español       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: August 2016     How and when will I learn whether I'm carrying twins or more?  Decades ago, most women who were pregnant with multiples didn't find out until they were in labor. But such late-term surprises are rare today. Women typically discover they're having more than one baby during an ultrasound , often in the first trimester.  If you're pregnant as a result of a fertility treatment such as Clomid , gonadotropins , or in vitro fertilization (IVF) , you'll probably have an ultrasound within the first eight weeks to count the number of embryos that have implanted. Ultrasound is almost foolproof at revealing multiple pregnancies, particularly after six to eight weeks. However, the more babies you're carrying, the easier it is for one to get overlooked.  You'll also have an early ultrasound if your healthcare provider hears more than one heartbeat with the handheld Doppler .  How do twins end up fraternal or identical?  Fraternal twins develop from two eggs that are released and fertilized at the same time by two different sperm. They're known as dizygotic (DZ). Identical twins develop from one egg that splits into two and are known as monozygotic (MZ).  Because they come from the same egg, so-called "identical" twins twins do have the same DNA. But even though they have the same genetic makeup, they're never exactly the same.  They have distinguishing physical characteristics that may allow their parents to tell them apart, possibly due to environmental influences, either inside or outside the womb. Also, certain genes may end up being expressed differently in each twin.    Live birth: Twins Follow one woman through her pregnancy with twins and watch her give birth.  How and when can I find out whether my babies are fraternal or identical twins?  An ultrasound can often tell you, based on whether there are one or two placentas and whether the babies are the same sex.  An experienced technician performing a transvaginal ultrasound between 9 and 14 weeks can determine with nearly 100 percent certainty whether your babies share a single placenta. (The accuracy rate drops to about 90 percent in the second trimester as the womb becomes more crowded.)  If your babies share a placenta, they're identical. If there are two placentas, your twins may be fraternal or identical. All fraternal twins and 20 to 30 percent of identical twins have separate placentas.  By 18 to 20 weeks, a technician may be able to identify the babies' sex, assuming that both are positioned such that the technician can get a good look at their genitals. If an ultrasound clearly shows that you have a boy and a girl, you'll know that your babies are fraternal. Identical twins are nearly always the same sex.  If the ultrasound shows two placentas and only one sex – or if the results are unclear – you may have to wait until your babies are born for your answer. After the birth, your provider will determine whether the twins shared a placenta. Because separate placentas sometimes fuse together and appear as one, a laboratory test may be needed to tell how many placentas there were.  If placental analysis doesn't solve the mystery, you can order an at-home DNA test for about $100 and get results in one to two weeks (or pay $400 for results in three days). Identical twins almost always have identical DNA, while fraternal twins share about 50 percent of their DNA.  As your babies grow up, it'll probably be easy to tell what type of twins they are just by looking at them. If they look so much alike that other people can't tell them apart, they're almost certainly identical. Any obvious difference in their hair color, eye color, or facial features means they're fraternal.  Why is it important to know whether twins are identical?  It's not simply a matter of satisfying your curiosity. It can also be important to know for medical reasons.  For one thing, identical twins who share a single placenta face a special health risk during pregnancy. Up to 15 percent of these twins will develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), a dangerous condition in which blood flows more to one twin than to the other. The twin on the receiving end tends to grow more rapidly than the donor twin.  Without treatment, the condition is usually fatal for both babies. If your twins are sharing a placenta, your healthcare provider will monitor their weight gain and watch for other signs of TTTS. If your provider suspects TTTS, prompt treatment may prevent complications and keep your babies healthy.  Even after your twins have grown up, it could be important to know whether they're identical. For example, if one twin is found to have a genetic disease, an identical sibling will have it too. A fraternal sibling, on the other hand, might be spared.  There's one more reason to find out whether your twins identical: Everyone will ask – from friends and relatives to strangers on the street. People are fascinated by twins, so be prepared to answer the question over and over again throughout your pregnancy and for years to come.     Show sources       Hide sources       AAP. 2011.

Is it implying more women are aborting due to possible health risks? Because surely they can't prevent becoming pregnant with fraternal twins? This "rate (i.e. fraternal twins pregnancies) hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world", but then it's added that it isn't common for Hispanics and Asian people to have twins... only fraternal twins then?... Sorry, I'm also confused about large body types; if anything, I was always told it's about hormones and that, for that reason, it'd be easier for curvy women (=more estrogen) to get pregnant, not necessarily large women? In that case, there should be a large concentration of twins in central and northern Europe and the US, no?     0 out of 0 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?

I am 30 yrs old and always had slightly irregular periods. The cycles could range from 30 days to 45 days… After a couple of months of trying to conceive with my husband, my period suddenly stopped altogether for a couple of months for no reason. I tested negative on pregnancy tests. So I got 50mg of Clomid that i took for one course on cd3-7 and i immediately became pregnant with twins! My insurance didn’t cover Clomid. So I got it online (thanks google). My sister gave me the code “CLO4MULT” and she said ‘just Google it’.     1 out of 2 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?

says  I bet those same women passing judgement on another's choice to have an abortion are also the same women that would be b1tch1ng up a storm if the girl/women decided to keep the baby & had to rely on welfare & various other social services to help raise the baby. Women make the extremely difficult decision to have an abortion for various reasons & amongst those are physical/mental conditions that could make carrying the baby full time life threatening to mother &/or child. Or emotionally, like others have already said, what if the person having the abortion was a rape victim? Are you going to be ignorant enough to expect her to carry/deliver that baby full term? Adoption isn't ALWAYS the best option. Pro life people crack me up. They are the biggest hypocrites you can come across. Most often times they are for pro life for religious reasons/beliefs, yet if they were truly following their own faith most religions frown against judging others. Pro lifers are the biggest judges of them all     2 out of 3 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?  Yes | No    Thank you!

says  I recently found out I am having twins at my scheduled abortion, I was so scared going in because I didn't know how I would feel afterwards especially since this would've been my first time. But once the nurse told me I was having multiples I just couldn't do it. When I first found out I was pregnant, I asked the father "what if it's twins?" crazy how I was right but I'm not shocked at all. The father is a twin and amongst that twins run my family this would make the 7th set that we know of. Four children is going to be tough but I'll adjust.     6 out of 8 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?  Yes | No    Thank you!

Abortion is a choice and it's difficult enough on the woman as it is, let alone adding in unrelated religious rants and judging.     14 out of 20 found this comment helpful     Was this comment helpful?

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

It’s advice that couples tend to ignore when talking to their fertility doctor about the number of embryos to transfer during IVF. Because the cost of fertility treatment is high and is usually not covered by insurance, they hedge their bets and gamble that transferring multiple embryos will increase the chances of getting pregnant. And while stricter guidelines for embryo transfer have been successful at reducing higher order multiples (triplets or more), "the next hurdle is how do we reduce the twin rate while maintaining the same pregnancy rate?" says R. Stan Williams, MD, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART), and professor and chair of the Department of OB-GYN at the University of Florida.  Patients, however, tend to not see the risks of being pregnant with two. Michael A. Feinman, MD, Medical Director of HRC Fertility in Southern California, says some couples strongly want to transfer two embryos or actually desire twins. "Some couples think twins are 'cute,' because they do not see the ones who experience the problems of prematurity or see how difficult it is for parents to handle them.”  The Risks of Multiples  Fertility doctors and patient advocates are working to educate patients about the serious health risks and high costs of having more than one baby at the same time.  “We have to do a better job educating patients about the health risks — they are not getting these messages,” says Barbara Collura, executive director of the infertility patient advocacy group RESOLVE. “They are being told it by their doctor as part of the informed consent process. But reproductive endocrinologists — you can ask any single one of them if they ever get pressure from the patients to transfer more than the required guidelines state, and they will tell you ‘yes, every day.’”  Even though there seem to be twins everywhere these days (between 1980 and 2004, the rate of multiple births increased by 70 percent), the risks to the health and well-being of the mother and babies — and the costs to society — are quite high.  “It has been shown that twin pregnancies cost society billions of dollars each year,” Dr. Feinman says. “These costs are due to increased maternal hospitalizations to prevent prematurity, increased intensive care for the babies from prematurity, and increased rates of lifelong disabilities like cerebral palsy in twins.”  Women who are pregnant with twins are at much higher risk for pregnancy complications, including: Premature birth: About 60 percent of twins are born prematurely at an average of 35 weeks. Low birthweight: More than half of twins are born at less than 5 ½ pounds. Low birthweight babies, especially those born before 32 weeks and/or weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds, are at increased risk of health problems during the newborn period, as well as lasting disabilities such as mental retardation , cerebral palsy , and vision and hearing loss . Cesarean section: Women who carry multiples may be more likely to need Caesarean sections, which may require a longer period of recovery and at times can increase the risk of hemorrhage during and after delivery. Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS): About 10 percent of identical twins who share a placenta develop TTTS, which occurs when a connection between the two babies' blood vessels in the placenta causes one baby to get too much blood flow and the other too little. Pre-eclampsia: Women expecting twins are more than twice as likely to develop pre-eclampsia, which is a combination of high blood pressure, protein in the urine and generalized swelling that can be dangerous for mother and baby. Gestational diabetes: This pregnancy-related form of diabetes can cause the baby to grow especially large, increasing the risk of injuries to mother and baby during vaginal birth. Babies may also have breathing and other problems during the newborn period. Single Pregnancy Is Safer  Being pregnant with one child is safer, with the greatest chances for an optimal outcome.  A recent study published in BMJ (British Medical Journal) found that women who undergo IVF are almost five times more likely to give birth to a single healthy baby following a single embryo transfer (SET) when compared with women who choose to have two embryos transferred. In addition, the SET appeared to significantly increase the chances of carrying the baby to full term (37 weeks).  With medical advances, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has come a long way from the early days of transferring six embryos in the hopes of getting just one to implant. Newer techniques such as blastocyst stage culture and transfer are maximizing pregnancy rates and minimizing the risk of a multiple pregnancy. By growing embryos for five days in the laboratory and enabling them to reach the blastocyst stage of development, fertility doctors can better determine which embryos have the greatest likelihood of implantation.  Research has shown that success rates for single embryo transfer vs. double embryo transfer are similar in certain circumstances. "In a favorable patient who is having a blastocyst (Day 5 embryo) transfer, one blastocyst is an equivalent pregnancy rate to two," Dr. Williams says.  But some couples have difficulty accepting these studies, according to Dr. Feinman. "They intuitively feel that the second embryo must hedge their bet. Also, input from friends and former patients often affects their feelings.”  The most recent 2009 guidelines on embryo transfer from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART are very individualized. For example, for a woman under age 35 who is in the favorable category, the recommendation is to transfer one embryo if it is a Day 5 (blastocyst), and one to two embryos if it is a Day 3.  "The big advantage of the American system is we can look at shades of gray," Dr. Williams explains. "Depending on the patient’s age, the prognosis of the patient, and the stage of the embryo development, we can develop guidelines that are more flexible to meet the needs of the patient while trying to reduce the potential for multiples."  Every Fertility Story Is Different  In addition to fertility problems such as blocked tubes, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and her husband’s low sperm count, Petra, a former fertility patient, now 51 and the mom of 5-year-old twins, had experienced a brain abscess and surgery to repair a congenital heart defect in her early 20s. After trying to get pregnant for 15 years, she and her husband tried in vitro fertilization (IVF).  “Once we got into the surgery room the embryologist told us that we had three blastocysts,” she says. “One of them was hatching, which was excellent news. The other one also looked wonderful. However, the last one was fragmented and would not survive the freeze. We had to make the decision to either transfer the last one or discard it. Desperate for a child, we decided to transfer all three.”  With her heart problems, however, Petra could not have endured a triplet pregnancy. “In my eighth week, I had a vanishing triplet, but I always wonder: What if that had not been the case? I would have been faced with some terrible decisions that women who undergo fertility treatments do not want to make. If we had to do it again, I would have ‘discarded’ the third embryo, and I wish I would have been more informed — even fragmented blastocysts can make it."  Dr. Feinman says that when discussing how many embryos to transfer, his fertility clinic usually abides by the ASRM guidelines. However, “personal issues and embryo quality will also affect our advice. For instance, if multi-fetal reduction is not an option, we might transfer one less embryo. Conversely, if embryo quality is poor, we might discuss transferring more than the recommended number. In ideal cases, such as egg donation, single embryo transfer should be strongly considered. Most clinics doing this show very little decrease in pregnancy rates, compared to transferring two embryos. Even a small decrease in success will be balanced by the higher pregnancy loss rates and prematurity associated with twins."  Ultimately, however, the decision-making rests with the fertility patient.  Educating Fertility Patients  The high cost of fertility treatment and the lack of insurance coverage are key reasons why fertility patients tend to turn a deaf ear to the risks involved with having multiples.  According to Petra, she and her husband were advised of the medical risks, but chose to have the three embryos transferred anyway. “I couldn’t wrap my head around having one baby ... especially since I knew I would not have a chance to do another IVF. I probably would have felt different if we had fertility coverage. I know our decision to transfer more than one embryo was, unfortunately, made with our finances in mind and not based on medical facts and studies.”  One of the biggest obstacles in patient care is cost, says Collura. “We also know that patients tend to feel more pressure to transfer more embryos when they have pressures on cost — if somebody does not have insurance, and they only have $15,000, they may say, ‘Look, I only have this one shot. Transfer as many as you can.’”  Dr. Feinman has seen this many times. “Some [patients] think [having twins] is cost-effective if they are paying for their care: ‘Two for the price of one,’” he explains. “Sometimes it is hard to convince them that this is not true, since twins tend to cost much more than a frozen embryo transfer.  “In Canada and much of Europe, the government will only cover IVF if the clinic performs single embryo transfers,” he continues. “In some countries, if a non-identical twin occurs, the clinics have to pay back the government. In the U.S., insurance companies have abdicated their moral right to affect the situation by refusing to cover IVF. Ironically, they spend a lot more money on the multiple births created by IVF than they would if they covered it and helped regulate it. If our government or insurance companies ever wake up and realize this fact, there might be a move toward increased coverage with increased restrictions accompanying this coverage.”  Collura says that patients make better health care decisions when the cost pressure recedes. “There’s a lot of data out there about insurance coverage in mandated states and the reduction of multiple births in those states.”  A new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers and published in Fertility and Sterility has found that the 15 states that provide insurance coverage for infertility saw significantly lower multiple birth rates. In 2005, it was estimated that the economic impact of preterm birth was $26.2 billion nationally.  RESOLVE has worked with Shady Grove Fertility, a Maryland fertility clinic, to produce a patient education video about the risks of multiples. The video is based on a true patient story and a letter the patient wrote to Shady Grove after she had twins born at 25 weeks, specifically asking Shady Grove if they could use her story to help educate others about the risks of premature birth. The video describes how one twin had intestinal surgery and how both spent approximately seven months in a hospital.  “I am hoping that hearing a person’s story about her own experience and providing some data is going to be effective,” Collura says. “Our idea is for this to be available to any fertility clinic, anywhere in the United States. "Whatever I can do to help that patient know more and be better educated, I'm going to do that."  SART developed a national consent form for fertility clinics to use that gives very detailed risks for pregnancy with multiples.  In addition, ASRM is in the early stages of developing a video about the risks of multiples, according to Dr. Williams. "We are very interested in reducing multiple pregnancies."

But instead of stifling their apprehensions, they went public with his-and-her rants on the parenting website Babble. Under the pseudonym Albert Garland, the husband wrote , “To say we’re excited would be an exaggeration. More truthfully, we’re pissed. And terrified, and angry, and guilty, and regretful … As horrible as this might sound, we found ourselves wishing these twins away … This time around, we’re counting down — not like expected parents but like cancer patients with only months to live.”  “In my mind I had done nothing less than ruin our family,” the wife added . “The twins are coming fast, and I don’t feel a sense of joy … the new me is expecting the worst.”  Predictably, their Babble bitching sessions sparked an uproar , with readers contributing nearly 1,000 comments — many calling their views “disgusting” and “heartless” and writing that “they don’t deserve those babies.” There was the sense that these parents were inexcusably naive about IVF, a process that they should have known results in twins 20% to 30% of the time, and that the world of infertility was one in which any pregnancy, especially an IVF one, should be considered a blessing.  (MORE : Get Used to Embryo Adoption )  But the couple’s flair for the dramatic notwithstanding, their posts aren’t outrageous. They’re refreshing. This husband and wife had the courage to voice the true fears and worries that many parents think about but don’t feel welcome to express, much less post publicly for the world to see. They have a right to be disappointed, and perhaps the more they come to terms with that, the better they can get mentally prepared for the huge life change ahead of them.  In fact, once we learn a little more about the “Garlands,” their reactions seem wholly rational. The family lives in a one-bedroom apartment. After the birth of their son three years ago, the couple suffered through the baby’s horrendous colic (and ongoing sleep and behavior problems) and the mother’s postpartum depression. Then came a difficult twin pregnancy. “I can’t care for my son the way I used to: I can’t get on the floor, I can’t bend over, I can’t pick him up, I can’t run after him. The low iron and gestational diabetes only add to the fatigue … Now my husband is doing everything and running himself into the ground,” she writes. Did I mention that they live in a one-bedroom apartment?  Mr. and Mrs. Garland are legitimately concerned about how their minds, health and marriage will survive more upheaval. “My wife and I know better than to think that life with three children is going to be perfect … Our fear is not the new parent fear of the unknown. It’s the smart, informed fear of the known,” the father writes. He’s right to be nervous. Raising newborn twins is hard. Raising three boys under 5 is hard. Thankfully, amid all the online condemnation, some readers offered commiseration and tips to survive the shock.  The Garland twins are probably already here. (The father wrote his piece in April, when the boys were four months along, and the mother wrote hers in June, seven months into the pregnancy. Their posts enjoyed a new round of publicity this week.) So we don’t know the rest of the story. But we should congratulate their parents for their brutal honesty. They’ve opened the door for other parents-to-be, especially those who used IVF who could benefit from talking about their feelings, even the uglier ones. By being so bluntly realistic about it from the get-go, they’ll probably be more prepared than other couples who uncritically coo about their “bundles of joy” and then feel blindsided by the challenges they never saw coming.
