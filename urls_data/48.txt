The US Social Security Administration keeps records of births and deaths and has their information available for purchase (apparently for a hefty price): Here  However I found a source that claims to have bought it and is offering it for free (as well as offering the data sorted by date on the site): Here  I'm assuming you can just use that as your sample and go through all the data with a script and find how many people actually die on their birthday. I would do that myself but I have 20 min left to download (they're about 1.5GB) so I'll try to get back to you on the statistics myself if I find the time to write up a script.  Of course the United States can't represent the entire world's population but it is a good start. I'm assuming you will see a higher rate in deaths on birthdays because of "first world problems" because we're using the United States and I think the effect would be less visible across the world...  Update - Numbers :D  I've ran through the Social Security Death Master File from the free source, so there's no way knowing if the information is valid. However, given the size that they're ~3 Gigabytes each and that there's no reason for anyone to spoof these kind of files... I'll assume they are valid.  You can see the code that I used to run through it here: http://pastebin.com/9wUFuvpN  It's written in C#, it reads through the lines of the death index one by one and then parses the date using regex. I assumed that the file was basically this format:  `(Social Security Number)(First Name)   (LastName)   (Middle Name)    (Some Letter)(MM-DD-YYYY of Death)(MM-DD-YYYY Of Birth)`  I had regex just pick out the last part for the dates of birth/death, check if any of the fields are just 0 (which I'm assuming it means that Social Security couldn't get a valid month/date for the record), and discard the 0's. Then it'll check if the day of birth and month of birth match the day of death/month of death and add that to the died on birthday count. It'll add all records that aren't 0's to the death count.  It outputs the results in this format:  Deaths On Birthday/Total Deaths   Lines Looked Through - People With a 0 in any of their record  It's be great if someone could double check that code, as I've found quite a few errors I've made before and could only tell because my results made no statistical sense.  Here is the console output:  Doing some math...   File 1 had 44665 Deaths on a Birthday out of 14879058 Deaths in Total  File 2 had 47060 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15278724 Deaths in Total  File 3 had 49289 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15374049 Deaths in Total  Total we have 141014 Deaths on a Birthday out of 45531831.   So we have ~0.3097% chance of dying on a birthday while statistically (1/365) would lead us to believe there is only ~0.27397% chance of dying on a birthday. That is indeed a 13% increase in chance of death on a birthday from 1/365. Of course this sample is only for Americans and only has 45 million records, I'm sure organizations who originally published their paper had access to much more reliable and larger death indexes. However, I think that it is indeed valid that deaths on a birthday is more likely than death on any other day.  Here's a Time article citing jumps in reasons for death on birthdays: Article  Edit 2: @cbeleites pointed out that I forgot to account for same day deaths, which would be a huge factor in increasing deaths on birthdays. Strictly speaking my data is still valid but I did not throw out if a person died on the same day they were born. It's interesting that my results were not affected too heavily by this error so it seems that these records don't include death on first day. I'll look into it later. I'm thinking there would be very interesting statistics I can look for such as death on days of the month and make a heatmap of some sort. I'll probably try to do that sometime...     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 1:26             answered Dec 28 '13 at 16:53       Mike Shi   316 1 7                  Chances are the OP wanted the theoretical probability. – ndoogan  Dec 28 '13 at 17:00        6      No, this is interesting too.

Roughly speaking the relative uncertainty in these calculation is going to be about 1/sqrt(47000) = 0.5%.

The 1st day mortality rates reported there are around 0.2 % for industrialized countries and 0.8 % average for all countries. Which means that the risk of dying on the day of birth is at least as high as the risk of dying at any of the following birth days*.  * I think it is a safe assumption that 1st day deaths do not appear in @Mark Shi's file, as the US 1st day mortality rates are reported to be 0.3 % ( other source: 0.26 % ). Which is almost the total birth day death rate in the social security file. So either babies who die at the day of birth do not get a social security number, or dying on a birth day > 1 year is extremely improbable.   side note: There are other days, such as Chirstmas and New Years Eve which are known to have higher-than-average mortality rates as well .     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 29 '13 at 18:47       cbeleites   20k 40 91              2      Ah yes, I forgot to account for deaths that occur on the same day as the birth. I'm assuming this was excluded from the data as the hospital would have to submit this data to the state for a birth certificate and they wouldn't submit data on babies who die I'm assuming. This has lead me to a series of awkward Google searches... "do dead babies get a social security number"... oh search history. – Mike Shi  Dec 29 '13 at 21:09        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      Here's an argument why the probability of death on the birthday may be higher than on other days: Birthdays are emotionally charged days. More over, people tend to celebrate it somehow.. So there is an excess of factors (relative to the person's usual life style) that increase biological stress (excess emotions, excess drinking, excess eating, excess dancing, excess banjee jumping etc). Statistically speaking, this situation increases the chances of dying on a birthday, since it intensifies any health issues a person may have, or because it exposes the person to situations and risks for which the person is inexperienced.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 28 '13 at 23:09             answered Dec 28 '13 at 18:44       Alecos Papadopoulos   38.8k 1 81 168              1      sure. but rather than speculate, let's measure :) – Hugh Perkins  Mar 26 at 2:06        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The probability that a newborn dies within a year can be found in the life tables. For example, you can check out the periodic life tables and look at the column $q_x$ for $x=0$ in the human mortality database .

That conspires such that the "statistical" probability is not 1/365.  To get an idea of this effect, lets first assume they are both almost uniform, only 29 february has a probability 1/4   of the others. That gives
$$
    365 p + \frac14 p=1
$$
so $p= 0.002737851$. That leads to probability of birth and death on the same day equal $356\cdot p^2 + (p/4)^2=  0.002736445  > 0.00273224=\frac1{366}$ which is the minimum possibe value (with 366 days).  With a bit more generality, let $p_i, i=1, \dotsc, n$ be the birtday probabilities, and $q_i, i=1,\dotsc,n$ the deathday probabilities, for a year with $n$ days. Then, if birtday and deathday for a person are statistically independent, we will find that
$$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}}
\P(\text{Birth and death on same day}) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i q_i
$$
so if $p_i=q_i$ then that is $\sum_i p_i^2$. That is a quantity known (in biology) as Simpsons index of (bio)diversity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index . Its inverse  could then be taken as "effective number of birthdays"! The minimum value of $\sum_i p_i^2$ is $1/n$. To see that use convexity.  But assuming $p_i=q_i$ is quite a stretch, lets first look at some data, birthday probabilities for Norway calculated from data from ssb.no:   Clearly not uniform, the high outlier is 1. july. That is not real, it is caused by immigrants without documented birthday registered that date. One max in spring, around beginning of april, another maximum in autumn, in september. The simpson index calculated from this is $ 0.002750224$, and the inverse is $363.6067$, so the "effective number of birthdays" is about 363 and a half, rather close to 366. So the nonuniformity maybe is not to important. It is more difficult to find data for deathday, but I found the paper https://tidsskriftet.no/2003/06/originalartikkel/dodelighet-i-norge-etter-tid-pa-aret-ukedag-og-fodselsdato (in norwegian) (this is the official journal of the norwegian medical association) they report around 12% higher rate of death in winter than in summer. They also  report a slightly increased risk of death at mondays! In fact, international comparisons reported by that paper shows that winter overmortality is lowest in scandinavia, in countries like Irland or England it about double. That might be surprising, might have to do with us scandinavians having warmer and better isolated houses.  From that we can reconstruct a deathday distribution. I take winter halfyear  as november-april. Then we can calculate
$$
p_w =1.12 p_s \\
(182 \cdot 1.12 + 184) p_s = 1
$$
leading to $p_s=0.002578383, p_w= 0.002887789$ and finally $\sum_i p_i q_i = 0.00273151$, its inverse, the "effective number of birthdays" being 366.1, pretty close to 366! The anticorrelation ($\rho(p_i,q_i)=-0.06$) seems to offset the nonuniformity in such a way that we could as well assume uniformity (and equal distribution for birthday and deathday). That is quite interesting.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 25 at 21:48       kjetil b halvorsen   21.8k 9 63 152              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      1 out of 365 would be the correct odds, because you are guaranteed to die on one day out of a 365 day year...

You should justify your assumption or otherwise address the information in the question and other answers to explain why it doesn't cause a problem for your assumption.

(Image courtesy of Flickr user Brimstone , under a Creative Commons license)   It happened to actress Ingrid Bergman, women's rights activist Betty Friedan, and — tradition has it — William Shakespeare. They all died on their birthdays, and new research finds the typically joyous day turns out to be more tragic than expected for some.  The average death rate on people's birthdays is 6.7 percent higher than what you'd otherwise normally expect on that day, according to a new analysis from University of Chicago economics researcher Pablo Pena. The rate is even higher for young people and on weekends, he finds.  Pena analyzed Social Security Administration records for 25 million people who died between 1998 and 2011. Births and deaths don't happen evenly across the year, so Pena's analysis controls for seasonal patterns by comparing birthday death rates to what would be expected on a given day.  The Social Security records themselves don't provide information on the cause of deaths or characteristics of the departed. But some patterns do emerge.  For instance, young people between 20-29 years old have an excess death rate of 25.4 percent —perhaps a sign of birthday celebrations gone wrong. Excess death rates are slightly higher for birthdays falling on weekends across all age groups, Pena's the analysis finds, while the excess death rate for 20-29 year olds almost doubles to 48.3 percent.   The study isn't the first to cast a sad shadow on birthday celebrations. A 2012 study in the journal Annals of Epidemiology found a much higher probability (about 14 percent) that people over 60 will die on their birthdays. That study , which analyzed more than 2 million deaths, found that strokes and heart attacks rose 18.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, on birthdays. Tragically, the study also found a 34.9 percent increase in suicides and a 44 increase in deaths from falls.  Pena, whose results will be published in the February 2015 issue of Social Science & Medicine, writes that his study sample is about 10 times larger than the 2012 study. He says further research is needed into what's behind the link between birthdays and deaths, such as the causes and the socioeconomic factors, to drive a potential policy response to prevent these deaths.  "In principle, those policies could be as simple as campaigns to increase awareness of the risks associated with changes in behaviors on or around birthdays," he writes.  In other words, celebrate responsibly.                     Jason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.

These, I submit, are among the most optimistic people on Earth, because they look at odds of 1 in 195,249,054 and still envision themselves winning.   Yet some of these people play the other side of much shorter odds, walking outside in a thunderstorm, ignoring bees buzzing flowerbeds, riding bicycles, and going for a swim, all apparently comfortable in the odds against such activities bringing them harm. They might not be so confident if they knew the true odds.  According to the National Safety Council, your odds of dying of various causes are:   Heart disease, 1 in 6  Cancer, 1 in 7  Stroke, 1 in 28  Motor vehicle accidents, 1 in 88  Intentional self-harm, 1 in 112  Accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances, 1 in 130  Falls, 1 in 171  Car crashes, 1 in 303  Assault by firearm, 1 in 306  Pedestrian, 1 in 649  Motorcycle rider, 1 in 770  Accidental drowning, 1 in 1,123  Exposure to smoke, fire, 1 in 1,177  Pedalcyclist 1 in 4,717  Firearms discharge, 1 in 6,309  Air and space transport accidents, 1 in 7,032  Electrocution, 1 in 9,943  Excessive natural heat, 1 in 12,517  Cataclysmic storm, 1 in 46,044  Lightning, 1 in 84,079  Legal execution, 1 in 96,691  Dog attack, 1 in 120,864  Earthquake or other ground movement, 1 in 148,756  Flood, 1 in 175,803  Fireworks discharge, 1 in 386,766                         Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                                     News  Tech  Health  Planet Earth  Strange News  Animals  History  Culture  Space.com                                                               News  Tech  Health  Planet Earth  Strange News  Animals  History  Culture  Space.com                                  News  Tech  Health  Planet Earth  Strange News  Animals  History  Culture  Space.com                                             Live Science Health  The Deadliest Day of the Week  By Sara G. Miller, Staff Writer | April 18, 2016 08:45am ET                            MORE           You're more likely to die on this day of the week.  Credit: Fer Gregory / Shutterstock.com     No, it's not spooky, creepy Halloween — the most deaths occur on regular old Saturdays.  Death can strike on any day of the week, but at Live Science we wanted to know if national data might reveal that some days are deadlier than others. To figure out which day of the week claims the most lives, we turned to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC's Wonder database contains data on all deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2014, and we found that, all told, there were more than 39 million deaths over the course of these 15 years. (Keep that time frame in mind as you read on — the numbers below represent the total number of deaths for this period.) [ The Odds of Dying ]  We found that, day by day, the breakdown was fairly equivocal, ranging from a low of 5.6 million total deaths on the Sundays during that period to a high of 5.7 million total deaths on the Saturdays of those years.  Moreover, the top 10 causes of death on each day lined up with the CDC's top 10 causes of death overall. In other words, no matter what day of the week we looked at, the top 10 causes of death were: heart disease , cancer , chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, strokes , Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, flu and pneumonia, kidney disease, and suicide.  So, nothing to see here? Not so fast. When we dug a little deeper, we found some interesting differences in the days that people die.        Mortality on Mondays  We found that deaths due to heart attacks peaked on Mondays, with a total of 348,206 fatal heart attacks reported by the CDC. Tuesday ranked second for heart attack deaths, with 337,918.  Interestingly, other research bears out this trend; a 2005 meta-analysis concluded that sudden cardiac deaths in the U.S. were more likely to occur on Mondays, regardless of people's age or sex.   Tuesdays  Tuesdays saw the highest number of deaths from the flu and pneumonia — 134,567 — though Wednesdays came in a very close second, with a total of 134,525 deaths from these diseases.  Deaths from car crashes , however, were the lowest on Tuesdays. Over the 15-year period, there were a total of 28,523 deaths from this cause on Tuesdays.   Wednesdays  Wednesdays fell smack dab in the middle for the total number of deaths that occurred over the time period: 5,606,470.   Thursdays  Though Thursdays didn't have the lowest total number of deaths overall, this day had the fewest deaths from heart attacks, diabetes and firearms.   Woeful weekends  Deaths from accidents peak on Saturdays and Sundays, with a total of 309,206 accident-related deaths on Saturdays and 289,248 on Sundays during the study period. And Fridays, with a total of 247,844 deaths from accidents, more closely resembled weekend days than weekdays. [ Understanding the 10 Most Destructive Human Behaviors ]  But accidents include many things. We looked deeper and found that the greatest number of car crash deaths occurred on Saturdays (42,332), followed by Sundays (39,943) and then Fridays (36,167).  Firearm deaths also peaked on the weekends, increasing from between 23,000 and 25,000 total on the different weekdays to more than 31,000 deaths during the Saturdays and Sundays of the study period. Here, Sunday had slightly higher numbers, with 32,314 firearm deaths, about 500 more than Saturday.  On a much smaller scale, the greatest number of deaths due to "contact with a venomous plant or animal" (that's the official term for it) also occurred on Saturdays. Over the 15-year period, there were a total of 216 reported deaths from a poison plant or animal on Saturdays, we found. Those numbered dropped off on Sundays, to the weekly low of 169 deaths.

The odds of dying on that day are higher than average, according to a study of millions of death records. The excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors, warned researchers.        Accident: New research suggests the excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors on birthdays Suicides triggered by the ‘birthday blues’ may also be to blame, said academics at Chicago University. Researcher Pablo Peña said the phenomenon could be due to people ‘deviating from their usual behaviour’ on their birthday.

Maybe you should take extra care on Christmas, New Year’s, your birthday and the days you get paid. On the Web site of Men’s Health magazine , Markham Heid assembles information from various studies that show days (or times of day) when you are more likely to shuffle off this mortal coil.  Your chances are 25 percent higher of dying on your birthday than the average day of the year, says economist Pablo Peña, author of one of those studies, who says “risky behaviors” involving alcohol, driving and stress are probably the cause.  For similar reasons, chances of dying also jump — though to a lesser degree — on the two big holidays we just passed, according to a different study. “More mystifying: Rates of death for all sorts of common diseases — from cancer to cardiovascular disease — also swell on the first day of the year,” Heid writes.  Several studies, including one from the University of Maryland, find that you are more likely to die soon after you get your paycheck. Again, increases in drinking and driving appear to be the cause.  As for the most lethal hour, Heid doesn’t really explain why — but if you’re reading this after 11 a.m., you’ve made it through the most dangerous time of day.

The US Social Security Administration keeps records of births and deaths and has their information available for purchase (apparently for a hefty price): Here  However I found a source that claims to have bought it and is offering it for free (as well as offering the data sorted by date on the site): Here  I'm assuming you can just use that as your sample and go through all the data with a script and find how many people actually die on their birthday. I would do that myself but I have 20 min left to download (they're about 1.5GB) so I'll try to get back to you on the statistics myself if I find the time to write up a script.  Of course the United States can't represent the entire world's population but it is a good start. I'm assuming you will see a higher rate in deaths on birthdays because of "first world problems" because we're using the United States and I think the effect would be less visible across the world...  Update - Numbers :D  I've ran through the Social Security Death Master File from the free source, so there's no way knowing if the information is valid. However, given the size that they're ~3 Gigabytes each and that there's no reason for anyone to spoof these kind of files... I'll assume they are valid.  You can see the code that I used to run through it here: http://pastebin.com/9wUFuvpN  It's written in C#, it reads through the lines of the death index one by one and then parses the date using regex. I assumed that the file was basically this format:  `(Social Security Number)(First Name)   (LastName)   (Middle Name)    (Some Letter)(MM-DD-YYYY of Death)(MM-DD-YYYY Of Birth)`  I had regex just pick out the last part for the dates of birth/death, check if any of the fields are just 0 (which I'm assuming it means that Social Security couldn't get a valid month/date for the record), and discard the 0's. Then it'll check if the day of birth and month of birth match the day of death/month of death and add that to the died on birthday count. It'll add all records that aren't 0's to the death count.  It outputs the results in this format:  Deaths On Birthday/Total Deaths   Lines Looked Through - People With a 0 in any of their record  It's be great if someone could double check that code, as I've found quite a few errors I've made before and could only tell because my results made no statistical sense.  Here is the console output:  Doing some math...   File 1 had 44665 Deaths on a Birthday out of 14879058 Deaths in Total  File 2 had 47060 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15278724 Deaths in Total  File 3 had 49289 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15374049 Deaths in Total  Total we have 141014 Deaths on a Birthday out of 45531831.   So we have ~0.3097% chance of dying on a birthday while statistically (1/365) would lead us to believe there is only ~0.27397% chance of dying on a birthday. That is indeed a 13% increase in chance of death on a birthday from 1/365. Of course this sample is only for Americans and only has 45 million records, I'm sure organizations who originally published their paper had access to much more reliable and larger death indexes. However, I think that it is indeed valid that deaths on a birthday is more likely than death on any other day.  Here's a Time article citing jumps in reasons for death on birthdays: Article  Edit 2: @cbeleites pointed out that I forgot to account for same day deaths, which would be a huge factor in increasing deaths on birthdays. Strictly speaking my data is still valid but I did not throw out if a person died on the same day they were born. It's interesting that my results were not affected too heavily by this error so it seems that these records don't include death on first day. I'll look into it later. I'm thinking there would be very interesting statistics I can look for such as death on days of the month and make a heatmap of some sort. I'll probably try to do that sometime...     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 1:26             answered Dec 28 '13 at 16:53       Mike Shi   316 1 7                  Chances are the OP wanted the theoretical probability. – ndoogan  Dec 28 '13 at 17:00        6      No, this is interesting too.

Roughly speaking the relative uncertainty in these calculation is going to be about 1/sqrt(47000) = 0.5%. So these differences are not statistically significant. – Dave31415  Mar 13 '14 at 5:01        add a comment |              up vote  8  down vote      We can be even more precise than @Mike Shi's data: the most dangerous of all birthdays is the very first one .  The 1st day mortality rates reported there are around 0.2 % for industrialized countries and 0.8 % average for all countries. Which means that the risk of dying on the day of birth is at least as high as the risk of dying at any of the following birth days*.  * I think it is a safe assumption that 1st day deaths do not appear in @Mark Shi's file, as the US 1st day mortality rates are reported to be 0.3 % ( other source: 0.26 % ). Which is almost the total birth day death rate in the social security file. So either babies who die at the day of birth do not get a social security number, or dying on a birth day > 1 year is extremely improbable.   side note: There are other days, such as Chirstmas and New Years Eve which are known to have higher-than-average mortality rates as well .     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 29 '13 at 18:47       cbeleites   20k 40 91              2      Ah yes, I forgot to account for deaths that occur on the same day as the birth. I'm assuming this was excluded from the data as the hospital would have to submit this data to the state for a birth certificate and they wouldn't submit data on babies who die I'm assuming. This has lead me to a series of awkward Google searches... "do dead babies get a social security number"... oh search history. – Mike Shi  Dec 29 '13 at 21:09        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      Here's an argument why the probability of death on the birthday may be higher than on other days: Birthdays are emotionally charged days. More over, people tend to celebrate it somehow.. So there is an excess of factors (relative to the person's usual life style) that increase biological stress (excess emotions, excess drinking, excess eating, excess dancing, excess banjee jumping etc). Statistically speaking, this situation increases the chances of dying on a birthday, since it intensifies any health issues a person may have, or because it exposes the person to situations and risks for which the person is inexperienced.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 28 '13 at 23:09             answered Dec 28 '13 at 18:44       Alecos Papadopoulos   38.8k 1 81 168              1      sure. but rather than speculate, let's measure :) – Hugh Perkins  Mar 26 at 2:06        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The probability that a newborn dies within a year can be found in the life tables.

That conspires such that the "statistical" probability is not 1/365.  To get an idea of this effect, lets first assume they are both almost uniform, only 29 february has a probability 1/4   of the others. That gives
$$
    365 p + \frac14 p=1
$$
so $p= 0.002737851$. That leads to probability of birth and death on the same day equal $356\cdot p^2 + (p/4)^2=  0.002736445  > 0.00273224=\frac1{366}$ which is the minimum possibe value (with 366 days).  With a bit more generality, let $p_i, i=1, \dotsc, n$ be the birtday probabilities, and $q_i, i=1,\dotsc,n$ the deathday probabilities, for a year with $n$ days. Then, if birtday and deathday for a person are statistically independent, we will find that
$$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}}
\P(\text{Birth and death on same day}) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i q_i
$$
so if $p_i=q_i$ then that is $\sum_i p_i^2$. That is a quantity known (in biology) as Simpsons index of (bio)diversity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index . Its inverse  could then be taken as "effective number of birthdays"! The minimum value of $\sum_i p_i^2$ is $1/n$. To see that use convexity.  But assuming $p_i=q_i$ is quite a stretch, lets first look at some data, birthday probabilities for Norway calculated from data from ssb.no:   Clearly not uniform, the high outlier is 1. july. That is not real, it is caused by immigrants without documented birthday registered that date. One max in spring, around beginning of april, another maximum in autumn, in september. The simpson index calculated from this is $ 0.002750224$, and the inverse is $363.6067$, so the "effective number of birthdays" is about 363 and a half, rather close to 366. So the nonuniformity maybe is not to important. It is more difficult to find data for deathday, but I found the paper https://tidsskriftet.no/2003/06/originalartikkel/dodelighet-i-norge-etter-tid-pa-aret-ukedag-og-fodselsdato (in norwegian) (this is the official journal of the norwegian medical association) they report around 12% higher rate of death in winter than in summer. They also  report a slightly increased risk of death at mondays! In fact, international comparisons reported by that paper shows that winter overmortality is lowest in scandinavia, in countries like Irland or England it about double. That might be surprising, might have to do with us scandinavians having warmer and better isolated houses.  From that we can reconstruct a deathday distribution. I take winter halfyear  as november-april. Then we can calculate
$$
p_w =1.12 p_s \\
(182 \cdot 1.12 + 184) p_s = 1
$$
leading to $p_s=0.002578383, p_w= 0.002887789$ and finally $\sum_i p_i q_i = 0.00273151$, its inverse, the "effective number of birthdays" being 366.1, pretty close to 366! The anticorrelation ($\rho(p_i,q_i)=-0.06$) seems to offset the nonuniformity in such a way that we could as well assume uniformity (and equal distribution for birthday and deathday). That is quite interesting.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 25 at 21:48       kjetil b halvorsen   21.8k 9 63 152              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      1 out of 365 would be the correct odds, because you are guaranteed to die on one day out of a 365 day year...

Could it be that your assumption that death is equally likely on every day might be flawed? Might it be, for example, that Alecos' suggested reason (in his answer) applies? You should justify your assumption or otherwise address the information in the question and other answers to explain why it doesn't cause a problem for your assumption. There may be such an argument but you'd need to offer it, not just hope it's true. – Glen_b ♦  Feb 22 '17 at 0:28         2      On a unrelated point, we should clarify the terms used here.

Should we include the actual dates in the event or just the time?  Should we account for possible errors in measuring the time?  Should the odds be conditional on the fact that you were born and that he was born?  Should the event account for the grandparent-grandson relationship?  What population should it apply to?  Should it account for the fact that 19:56 is (mathematically) a very special time or not? – whuber ♦  Jul 20 '16 at 14:16        1      A major difficulty with assessing how unusual an event like this is, is that these events are never specified before-the-event, but only after the event -- these are always data-generated hypotheses (see also p-hacking, data-dredging). Treating the hypothesis of interest and the data that led us to it as if they had arrived independently of each other leads to nonsensically low answers. Usually there's no good way of actually arriving at a reasonable answer to such questions (on occasion however we can sometimes figure out a way to give an approximate answer to such questions). – Glen_b ♦  Jul 22 '16 at 0:34        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote      In a world with 7 billion people (not counting the many more people who have died), and with a calendar with only 366 dates, the probability of such an event happening at least once was approximately 1.

If you are looking for a rigorously true and statistically backed statement to tell your grandson how special he is and make him interested in numbers at the same time, my answer would be as follows:  If you take another person at random, the probability of that person have been boon in the same calendar year as you is roughly 1/365.25.  The probability of having been born in the time coded by your birth year (that is, 19:56 if you were born in 1956) is 1/(24*60), that is 1/1440. Here I'm making the simplification that your birth year encodes a time, which doesn't hold for people born between 1960 and 1999, but I think I can do this simplification because:   Taking it in account would reduce the probability and make your grandson even more special, so we are keeping our numbers in the safe side.  Since we are interested in grandmas and grandsons and I expect that most grandmas of 2008 born grandsons were born before 1960, the correction wouldn't be as dramatic as it my seem.   Then, the probability of a random person being born in the same calendar day and the hour encoded by your birth year is about 1/(365.25*1440), that is 1 on 525960.  Since grandsons have two grandmas each, only one on 262980 will show such a coincidence - and that looks as a tiny probability, so you and your grandson can appreciate how lucky you have been. Furthermore, this probability only holds for grandsons with two grandmas born before 1960; for grandsons with two grandmas born after 1960 that probability is exactly zero, so you can feel still more special.  Now maybe you want to stop reading, because my second answer will be about discussing how special is being so special, and I'm afraid @Kodiologist is right.  1 out of 262980 is a tiny probability, but it's no so tiny compared with the population of most countries or the population of the Earth. Therefore:   About 13300 people on Earth were born in October 10th at 19:56 (of different years).  About 25000 people on Earth may have such a date and time combination with one of their grandmas - although I'm overestimating the number here because I'm not taking on account that some living people have grandmas born in 1860-1899 or 1960-1999.  That date twist is just one of several possible twists. There are a lot more people who can claim a similarly special link by other twists (e.g. same day, same hour, or twist between day and hour as February 10th and 02:10, and so).  What would actually be very special is to have such a date twist with both grandmas. The probability to exist a person in the Earth showing such a coincidence is below 3%.   Anyway, don't forget to remind your grandson that he is special because of how much you love him, and that no statistics can account for that.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 21 '16 at 23:16             answered Jul 20 '16 at 9:12       Pere   3,599 1 6 16              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

We've argued before about the probabilities and I am still not satisfied. My point was that the chances are tiny if you consider the probabilities of being in a relationship (+ being successful at it for X amount of time). I find the amount of factors to take into account quite vast (up to a point, gender and age, availability, probabilities of separation in our region, etc.)  Is it even possible to calculate the probabilities on something like this?

If you had that probability, P(Same day and same year) = P(Same year) $\times$ P(Same day|same year). But P(same day) should be roughly independent of whether you were born in the same year.

That is, if you had asked, before meeting your current boyfriend "What are the odds that the next man I have a relationship with will be born on same day and year?" the odds would have been 1 in 3000 or so.  However, post hoc (that is, while in the relationship) it's trickier because you would have noticed a lot of other coincidences too: My boyfriend was born the day before me!  My boyfriend's mother has the same name as my mother!" etc etc.  The odds of "some weird connection with my boyfriend" are impossible to calculate.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 11 '14 at 17:43       Peter Flom ♦   68.8k 9 97 186              44      @Emilie multiply $1/3000$ by the probability of having a successful relationship.

From experience I'd guess around 20% or so, no way to seriously calculate that, but no matter what it exactly is, just want to be clear having a special weird connection means nothing (though it is fun).  Then, something the other didn't take into account, looking at birth rates per month   we get a nice overview (it's caused by things like people being off thus having a lot of free time on hand 9 months before the months in question), next dividing that percentage by the number of days in that month.  Next one should figure out what the chance is of being born in the same year. Just to give an impression of this chance I'd start with the rule of thumb as presented by xkcd which gives a dating age range of $\pm \ age-\frac{age}{2}+7$, where age $=$ age you started dating. Which in turn gives $P(same\  year)=\frac{1}{pool\ size}$. However, the chances of dating someone from the exact same year are far greater due to a flaw in the educational system where pooling is done by the date of conception . A consequence of this is that the pool of people you know from the exact same ages is by guesstimation a factor of 5 bigger than the expected value, if $age<24$ or so.  What that exactly boils down to depends on age and month born, but for me it boiled down to more than 0.2% (1 in 500). Definitely not normal, but then again, coming full circle, you will find something like that for everyone after the fact.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 12 '14 at 0:12       David Mulder   235 2 9              1      I'm told disproportionally many babies are born just before new year in The Netherlands, where a 31 December birth is financially advantageous over a 1 January birth, due to the way benefits are calculated.

If you had that probability, P(Same day and same year) = P(Same year) $\times$ P(Same day|same year).  But P(same day) should be roughly independent of whether you were born in the same year. So it will be $\approx$ P(Same year) $\times$ P(Same day).  So if you had some good estimate of P(Same year), you can calculate the overall probability reasonably well.  I'd guess that P(same year) is roughly of the order of 0.1 to 0.2, but that's just a guess.

Thus, a baseline estimate for sharing the same date of birth would be the above statistic divided by two (because it captures 2 years) for sharing the same year multiplied by the probability of sharing the same birthday:  $$P(DOB_i=DOB_j)\approx \frac{0.332}{2} \times \frac{1}{365} = 0.00045$$  Or roughly 1 in 2200.  As has been noted, both the shared year and shared birthday probabilities could be further refined based on additional information.   Probability of shared year: The distribution of age differences in relationships varies based on many factors including culture and time. Also, the above statistic is for a year difference. Dividing by two might lead to an underestimation because the probability of being within six months of age is probably more than half the probability of being within a year.  Shared date of birth: There could be tweaks to this. In particular, the uneven distribution of births throughout the year could have a small effect. If you're born in a leap year, then you have 366 as the base divisor. Then there is the elusive effect that being born on the same day might have on you both. In particular, if you are a person who reads into such things and searches for coincidences, such a coincidence might subtly increase your chances of staying together.   Thinking about other coincidences  When it comes to two people, there are many potential sources of coincidences. Humans are very good at identifying patterns. Within the domain of date of births, you could imagine many possible similarities: same month; same day of month; same star sign; same birthday, different year; some similarity in the numbers such as 2nd of May and 5th of February; dates are some round number apart (e.g., 8th of May 18th of May); dates are only only some small number apart (e.g., 8th and 9th of May). We could in some sense describe our sense to which any of these feel surprising or like a major coincidence.  But of course, when we speak about coincidences there is a much wide domain of search. For example, we could look at similarities in names, employment history, appearance, etc. The larger you cast the search, the more possible bases there are for finding coincidences.  In general, the more you look for them, the more you will see them. This is analogous to the analyst who performs many post-hoc statistical tests without correcting alpha. With enough analyses, the probability of finding a significant pattern gets close to one even when alpha is small.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 14 '14 at 6:42             answered Mar 14 '14 at 4:25       Jeromy Anglim   31.1k 15 112 218              add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Although the question is about birthdays, the "birthday paradox" isn't really relevant here. It's about how many random samples you need to take before you expect at least two samples among them to be equal (a collision). Your question is mostly about the probability of two samples being equal. If there were 30 people in your relationship then you'd expect two of them to share a birthday but there aren't 30 people, there are only 2.  The odds of having a relationship only have quite a small effect. Most people have a relationship at one time or another. I'd guess more than half of adults have one right at this moment. Some people have several at once, mentioning no Présidents de la République  in particular ;-) So it's not going to massively reduce the odds, maybe halve them.  The main consideration is, given this significant person, what is the probability of them sharing your birthday? On pure chance it'd be roughly 1/365 given that the person in question exists at all. Since you choose a partner based on everything you know about them, which includes their birthday, you can't discount the possibility that the actual incidence is significantly higher or lower.  Look at it another way: what's the chance of there being someone who delivers your post and shares your birthday? The chance of a randomly-selected person being the one who delivers your post is tiny, but so what if it is? It doesn't affect the answer. Assuming universal delivery (which I can in my country), someone delivers my post. If there's only one then the answer is roughly 1/365. We can completely exclude from consideration all the people who don't deliver my post, they don't affect the odds no matter how many of them there are.  What's the chance that you have a partner who shares your birthday? It's about 1/365, times the chance you have a partner. Then adjusted by any factors that mean sharing your birthday is correlated or anti-correlated with dating you.  What's the chance that your boyfriend shares your birthday? Well the question pretty much assumes that you have a boyfriend, so strike that part from consideration!  To incorporate the year you need to look at the way the age differences in relationships are distributed. As a rough guess, I'd look at what proportion of relationships have an age difference of less than a year, and multiply my previous number by that. Of course, if you have access to that kind of data you might just be able to look at what proportion of relationships match your criteria, and get the exact frequency without estimating anything :-)  In a society where there's a strong tradition that the man should be somewhat older than the woman in a relationship, you might find that the proportion of age differences below a year is very small, and the proportion couples who share date and year of birth is tiny. This could be the case even if the average age difference is just a couple of years. So maybe you are special, by bucking society's rules. Myself, I'd guess that the proportion of relationships with an age difference less than a year is probably over 10%. But I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong and besides, a lot of my friends met their partners at university, which clearly affects the age difference among the available candidates and that biases what I see to make my guess. Everyone's equal in modern society (right?), but "the man a couple of years older than the woman" is probably a stereotype for a reason.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 13 '14 at 16:26             answered Mar 13 '14 at 15:59       Steve Jessop   161 5                  I totally agree that the man having to be older is a dated stereotype...still, said bf seemed somewhat relieved when we compared birth hours as he is the eldest :-) – Emilie  Mar 13 '14 at 16:08            @Emilie: you could take your age into consideration when estimating your chances. It might be that couples formed 50+ years ago have a very different age-difference distribution from couples formed now, and so your coincidence is becoming more common over time and your chances are better than your grandparents's chances were. – Steve Jessop  Mar 13 '14 at 16:09         add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      The chances for this to happen.... two people having their birthday on the same day as explained by the other posters is 1/365 * 1/30 to be conservative here with the age ranges. To be in a relationship, a successful one multiply by maybe 1/2 or 1/3?!  However, for you to be in a relationship, you first have to be here. For you to be here, your mom and dad needed to get together - how likely was that then? Then their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, predecessors, apes, fish, amoebas, rays of sun hitting the first predecessors to plants, back to the big bang going as it did and whatever was before it. If you consider all, then every atom in the universe had to be exactly the way it was for you to be there.  You could almost say it's a miracle you guys got together.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 12 '14 at 17:34       n13   131 3              add a comment |         protected by gung ♦  Mar 18 '14 at 18:22   Thank you for your interest in this question.

Yet researchers who have studied more than two million people over the course of two decades have found that the term might be apt: we are more likely to die on our own birthday than any other day of the year.  ( MORE :  Got Plaque? It May Be Linked with Early Cancer Death )   The study, published in the journal Annals of Epidemiology , found that people over 60 were 14% more likely to die on their birthdays than on any other day. The most common causes of birthday deaths were heart attacks, which rose 18.6% on birthdays, and strokes, which were up 21.5%. There is also a 34.9% rise in suicide, and a remarkable 44% jump for deaths by falling down.  Or perhaps people are keen to emulate famous birthday-perishers William Shakespeare, who died on his birthday on April 23 1616, and actress Ingrid Bergman, who also left on the anniversary of the day she arrived, in August 1982.  Prof. Richard Wiseman, a University of Hertfordshire psychologist, explained to The Daily Telegraph :  “There are two camps – one is the camp that suggests you eat too much and your getting on a bit and that causes you to die. The other is a placebo effect. You are knife-edged on death. And you kept yourself going until your birthday. You think ‘that’s it, I’ve had enough, I’m out of here.”  Happy birthday, everyone.

Researchers have found that an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, falls and suicides makes our birthdays a far more dangerous day of the year than any other.  Alamy Legitimate research has suggested that your birthday could be the most dangerous day of the year  A study of two million people found that over-60s were 14 per cent more likely to die on their birthday, with a staggering 44 per cent jump in fall deaths on the big day.  At the time of publishing the study, Dr Vladeta Ajdacic-Gross of the University of Zurich said: "Birthdays end lethally more frequently than might be expected."  As chilling as it sounds, the sinister findings have been backed up by Canadian research into birthday deaths as well.  It emerged that stroke risks are higher than average on birthdays, particularly among people with high blood pressure.  Alamy A study of people who died on their big day has revealed that stroke, heart attack and fall risks all spike on birthdays  Psychologist prof Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, told the Telegraph : "It seems to be a valid finding.  "There are two camps - one is the camp that suggests you eat too much and you're getting on a bit and that causes you to die.  "The other is a placebo effect. You are knife-edged on death. And you kept yourself going until your birthday. You think 'that's it I've had enough I'm out of here'."  However, it's not just birthdays which have a habit of going south - there are other dangerous days to watch out for as well.  Alamy Take care next time your birthday comes around - it's the deadliest date of all  For one, studies have shown that New Year's Day is one of the deadliest dates on any calendar, with a far higher risk of death than any normal day.   DEAD INTRIGUING This interactive graph can predict what's most likely to kill you   University of California researchers found that 5 per cent more people die from natural causes on January 1 than any other day.  Other studies have also pointed to an increased risk of accidents over the festive period - with Christmas day another dangerous date.  It's not yet known for sure why birthdays and New Year's Day are so dangerous - but you may want to take extra care if your birthday happens to fall on January 1.

But why should that be? As the researchers put it, "birthdays… appear to end up in a lethal way more frequently than expected ." This is not a joke. The study was carried out by legitimate scientists who analysed data from 2.5 million deaths in Switzerland between 1969 and 2008. There are a number of hypotheses which may explain the finding. Perhaps some people close to death "hang on" until their birthday, to reach another milestone? Or perhaps a significant number of people take greater risks on their birthdays, like driving home from their own parties drunk?     But Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician from Cambridge University, says the Swiss data does not support the "hanging on" theory.  More or Less: Behind the stats  Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast  Download the More or Less podcast  More stories from More or Less  "They don't find any dip before so there's no holding on," he says, "and they don't find any blip after, so there's no jumping the gun. It's purely a birthday effect." The Swiss data, he says, suggests "something on your birthday kills you". The University of Zurich's Dr Vladeta Ajdacic-Gross, who led the study, says the data on birthday deaths shows the risk of death is greater for certain causes, like accidents and suicide. But Spiegelhalter sees no evidence for this. As far as he is concerned, the data "is compatible with a uniform 14% blip on all causes, all ages, both sexes". So he offers an alternative hypothesis - that some of the death registration records used by the researchers were simply inaccurate.      Image caption  When birth and death dates match, it may sometimes be a mistake...   "This is a very big study. There are 2.5 million deaths they've looked at," he says. "But if we actually look at what the excess is, it's 900 deaths in which people have been registered to have the same birth date as death date. That's not that many out of 2.5 million. "Now maybe I'm getting sceptical in my old age but this is only to do with matching registrations. The Swiss are, I'm sure, very precise book-keepers. But it's possible that someone could have a matching birth date and death date in their record when that wasn't actually the case." One can imagine how such an error might occur. What if the birth date of a deceased person was unknown? Someone might use their death date as the birth date too, just to fill the box. Then there's pure accident - someone in a hurry might write the same date in both boxes by mistake. If such mistakes occurred in just 0.04% of death records, the entire effect could be explained away.      Image caption  Might people be holding out for a milestone birthday?   "I'm not saying that's what happened," says Spiegelhalter. "But for me to be convinced about this frankly rather implausible finding, I'd want to see [the researchers] go back to every single match and double-check." Ajdacic-Gross concedes that administrative errors could be to blame for some of the spike in deaths on birthdays. If you take a "worst-case scenario" for the frequency of errors in the death registration system, he says, the excess risk of dying on your birthday drops to around 4%. This, he argues, is still a significant result. And despite Spiegelhalter's concerns about this particular study, there is some evidence that people close to death can have some influence over the date of their departure. The economists Joshua Gans and Andrew Leigh published a paper in 2006 which examined the effect on death rates of a change in Australian tax law.  Are you a risk-taker?   Lab UK's Big Risk Test takes about 25 minutes  Includes attitudes to luck  Asks users to weigh risks of activities such as air travel, gardening and smoking   Take the Big Risk Test  Aitken and Spiegelhalter on luck and risk  In 1978 the Australian government decided to abolish estate taxes - or inheritance tax. The estates of anyone who died on or after 1 July 1979 would escape tax. The estates of anyone who died before that date would not. The data suggests a significant number of deaths were "postponed" long enough to avoid paying tax. If the very ill are able to move their date of death forwards as well as backwards, says Joshua Gans, "any country that introduces an inheritance tax should expect a spike in the death rate in the week before the law takes effect." Readers will have to decide for themselves how to interpret these studies. But this journalist won't lose too much sleep when his next birthday rolls around.

Birthday effect   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   For the mathematical coincidence, see Birthday problem .  "Birthday blues" redirects here. For the movie, see Birthday Blues . For the album, see Birthday Blues (album) .     The actress Ingrid Bergman was born 29 August 1915 and died 29 August 1982 from breast cancer.    The birthday effect (sometimes called the birthday blues , especially when referring specifically to suicide ) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their birthday . The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in England and Wales , [1]  Switzerland , [2] [3]  Ukraine , [4] and the United States , [5] [6] as well as in smaller populations such as Major League Baseball players. [7] Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday, [5] while others find no significant gender effect. [8] [9] Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased mortality salience , or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies. [5] [7]     Contents    1  Studies  2  Possible explanations   2.1  External causes  2.2  Psychosomatic and psychological  2.3  Physiological  2.4  Statistical    3  References     Studies [ edit ]      Gabby Hartnett is one of the statistically unusual number of MLB players to have died on his birthday. [7]    With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on February 29 , there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts. [5]  A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80; [2] another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: heart attack and stroke (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths. [3] Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%. [6] An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women. [4] Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players [7] and people with entries in the Encyclopedia of American History . [5]  Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in Denmark [10] and Hungary , [11] but not in Bavaria [12] or Taiwan . [12]  However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and Austria (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday. [8] A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect. [9] A small study by Leonard Zusne found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole. [13] The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but it was not seen in the population as a whole . [1]  Possible explanations [ edit ]  External causes [ edit ]  Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. Binge drinking can increase an individual's risk of death through alcohol poisoning , accidents and drunk driving , as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk. [4] [11] In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents. [14] [15]  Psychosomatic and psychological [ edit ]  See also: Mortality salience  Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on psychosomatic effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life. [5] [16] According to the terror management theory , this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the public sphere of life (for example, career -driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the private sphere (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on. [5] [7] [16] Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering suicidal ideation will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve. [11]  The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as Christmas , [9] and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a Passover effect among the Jewish community (which moves with the festival itself ), and a Mid-Autumn Festival effect among the Chinese. [5] [16]  Physiological [ edit ]  It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour circadian rhythm , the body also has a yearly "circannual" biological rhythm . Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a zeitgeber that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death. [4]  Statistical [ edit ]  It is possible when processing death certificates to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide. [5] Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders. [17] These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.

The site, DeathRiskRankings.com , is the brainchild of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides answers based on publicly available data from the United States and Europe, comparing mortality risks by gender, age, cause of death and geographic region. Put your info in, and it produces the probable causes of your demise and provides insight on the timing of that unfortunate event.  The site can compare such things as the odds of death next year by breast cancer for, say, a 54-year-old Pennsylvania woman or her counterpart in the United Kingdom.  Of course the results produced by the web site speak to groups of people and cannot predict with accuracy when you might actually kick the bucket . The timing of your own end is based on many uncharted factors, from heredity to lifestyle to untimely accidents.  But noodling around with the interface can be enlightening, if not frightening.  "It turns out that the British woman has a 33 percent higher risk of breast cancer death. But for lung/throat cancer, the results are almost reversed, and the Pennsylvania woman has a 29 percent higher risk," explained Paul Fischbeck, site developer and professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.  "Most Americans don't have a particularly good understanding of their own mortality risks , let alone ranking of their relevant risks," said David Gerard, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon who is now an associate professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.  The researchers found that beyond infancy, the risk of dying increases annually at an exponential rate.  A 20-year-old U.S. woman has a 1 in 2,000 (or 0.05 percent) chance of dying in the next year, for example. By age 40, the risk is three times greater; by age 60, it is 16 times greater; and by age 80, it is 100 times greater (around 1 in 20 or 5 percent).  "The risks are higher, but still not that bad," Gerard said. "At 80, the average U.S. woman still has a 95 percent chance of making it to her 81st birthday."  Other results for queries about dying within the year:  For every age group, men have a much higher annual death risk than women. For 20-year-olds, the risk is 2.5 to three times greater for men. Men are much more prone to accidents, homicides and suicides, and the risk of dying from heart disease is always higher for men than women, peaking in the 50s when men are 2.5 times at greater risk of dying.  Women's cancer risks are higher than men's in their 30s and 40s.  For heart disease and cancer, U.S. blacks have a much higher death risk than U.S. whites. Overall, blacks in their 30s and 40s are twice as likely to die within the year as their white counterparts. Only for suicides, do whites consistently exceed blacks, where whites typically have two to three times greater chances of dying.  For 20-year-old males, 80 percent of their death risks are from accidents, homicides and suicides. By age 50, however, these causes make up less than 10 percent and heart disease is No. 1, accounting for more than 30 percent of all deaths.   Obesity-related death risks are much higher in the United States than in Europe. For example, the annual diabetes death risk in the United States is three times that found in northern Europe for 60 year olds.  Fischbeck and Gerard hope the site will add information to the U.S. healtchcare debate .  "We believe that this tool, which allows anyone to assess their own risk of dying and to compare their risks with counterparts in the United States and Europe, could help inform the public and constructively engage them in the debate," Fischbeck said.

The US Social Security Administration keeps records of births and deaths and has their information available for purchase (apparently for a hefty price): Here  However I found a source that claims to have bought it and is offering it for free (as well as offering the data sorted by date on the site): Here  I'm assuming you can just use that as your sample and go through all the data with a script and find how many people actually die on their birthday. I would do that myself but I have 20 min left to download (they're about 1.5GB) so I'll try to get back to you on the statistics myself if I find the time to write up a script.  Of course the United States can't represent the entire world's population but it is a good start. I'm assuming you will see a higher rate in deaths on birthdays because of "first world problems" because we're using the United States and I think the effect would be less visible across the world...  Update - Numbers :D  I've ran through the Social Security Death Master File from the free source, so there's no way knowing if the information is valid. However, given the size that they're ~3 Gigabytes each and that there's no reason for anyone to spoof these kind of files... I'll assume they are valid.  You can see the code that I used to run through it here: http://pastebin.com/9wUFuvpN  It's written in C#, it reads through the lines of the death index one by one and then parses the date using regex. I assumed that the file was basically this format:  `(Social Security Number)(First Name)   (LastName)   (Middle Name)    (Some Letter)(MM-DD-YYYY of Death)(MM-DD-YYYY Of Birth)`  I had regex just pick out the last part for the dates of birth/death, check if any of the fields are just 0 (which I'm assuming it means that Social Security couldn't get a valid month/date for the record), and discard the 0's. Then it'll check if the day of birth and month of birth match the day of death/month of death and add that to the died on birthday count. It'll add all records that aren't 0's to the death count.  It outputs the results in this format:  Deaths On Birthday/Total Deaths   Lines Looked Through - People With a 0 in any of their record  It's be great if someone could double check that code, as I've found quite a few errors I've made before and could only tell because my results made no statistical sense.  Here is the console output:  Doing some math...   File 1 had 44665 Deaths on a Birthday out of 14879058 Deaths in Total  File 2 had 47060 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15278724 Deaths in Total  File 3 had 49289 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15374049 Deaths in Total  Total we have 141014 Deaths on a Birthday out of 45531831.   So we have ~0.3097% chance of dying on a birthday while statistically (1/365) would lead us to believe there is only ~0.27397% chance of dying on a birthday. That is indeed a 13% increase in chance of death on a birthday from 1/365. Of course this sample is only for Americans and only has 45 million records, I'm sure organizations who originally published their paper had access to much more reliable and larger death indexes. However, I think that it is indeed valid that deaths on a birthday is more likely than death on any other day.  Here's a Time article citing jumps in reasons for death on birthdays: Article  Edit 2: @cbeleites pointed out that I forgot to account for same day deaths, which would be a huge factor in increasing deaths on birthdays. Strictly speaking my data is still valid but I did not throw out if a person died on the same day they were born. It's interesting that my results were not affected too heavily by this error so it seems that these records don't include death on first day. I'll look into it later. I'm thinking there would be very interesting statistics I can look for such as death on days of the month and make a heatmap of some sort. I'll probably try to do that sometime...     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 1:26             answered Dec 28 '13 at 16:53       Mike Shi   316 1 7                  Chances are the OP wanted the theoretical probability. – ndoogan  Dec 28 '13 at 17:00        6      No, this is interesting too.

Roughly speaking the relative uncertainty in these calculation is going to be about 1/sqrt(47000) = 0.5%.

The 1st day mortality rates reported there are around 0.2 % for industrialized countries and 0.8 % average for all countries. Which means that the risk of dying on the day of birth is at least as high as the risk of dying at any of the following birth days*.  * I think it is a safe assumption that 1st day deaths do not appear in @Mark Shi's file, as the US 1st day mortality rates are reported to be 0.3 % ( other source: 0.26 % ). Which is almost the total birth day death rate in the social security file. So either babies who die at the day of birth do not get a social security number, or dying on a birth day > 1 year is extremely improbable.   side note: There are other days, such as Chirstmas and New Years Eve which are known to have higher-than-average mortality rates as well .     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 29 '13 at 18:47       cbeleites   20k 40 91              2      Ah yes, I forgot to account for deaths that occur on the same day as the birth. I'm assuming this was excluded from the data as the hospital would have to submit this data to the state for a birth certificate and they wouldn't submit data on babies who die I'm assuming. This has lead me to a series of awkward Google searches... "do dead babies get a social security number"... oh search history. – Mike Shi  Dec 29 '13 at 21:09        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      Here's an argument why the probability of death on the birthday may be higher than on other days: Birthdays are emotionally charged days. More over, people tend to celebrate it somehow.. So there is an excess of factors (relative to the person's usual life style) that increase biological stress (excess emotions, excess drinking, excess eating, excess dancing, excess banjee jumping etc). Statistically speaking, this situation increases the chances of dying on a birthday, since it intensifies any health issues a person may have, or because it exposes the person to situations and risks for which the person is inexperienced.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 28 '13 at 23:09             answered Dec 28 '13 at 18:44       Alecos Papadopoulos   38.8k 1 81 168              1      sure. but rather than speculate, let's measure :) – Hugh Perkins  Mar 26 at 2:06        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The probability that a newborn dies within a year can be found in the life tables. For example, you can check out the periodic life tables and look at the column $q_x$ for $x=0$ in the human mortality database . This is not exactly want you want, but will give you an idea.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 28 '13 at 18:38             answered Dec 28 '13 at 18:31       Stat   5,236 1 13 39              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      In addition to the other excellent answers, but there is a point none of them discussed: Birthdays are not uniformly distributed over the year, and neither are deathdays. That conspires such that the "statistical" probability is not 1/365.  To get an idea of this effect, lets first assume they are both almost uniform, only 29 february has a probability 1/4   of the others. That gives
$$
    365 p + \frac14 p=1
$$
so $p= 0.002737851$. That leads to probability of birth and death on the same day equal $356\cdot p^2 + (p/4)^2=  0.002736445  > 0.00273224=\frac1{366}$ which is the minimum possibe value (with 366 days).  With a bit more generality, let $p_i, i=1, \dotsc, n$ be the birtday probabilities, and $q_i, i=1,\dotsc,n$ the deathday probabilities, for a year with $n$ days. Then, if birtday and deathday for a person are statistically independent, we will find that
$$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}}
\P(\text{Birth and death on same day}) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i q_i
$$
so if $p_i=q_i$ then that is $\sum_i p_i^2$. That is a quantity known (in biology) as Simpsons index of (bio)diversity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index . Its inverse  could then be taken as "effective number of birthdays"! The minimum value of $\sum_i p_i^2$ is $1/n$. To see that use convexity.  But assuming $p_i=q_i$ is quite a stretch, lets first look at some data, birthday probabilities for Norway calculated from data from ssb.no:   Clearly not uniform, the high outlier is 1. july. That is not real, it is caused by immigrants without documented birthday registered that date. One max in spring, around beginning of april, another maximum in autumn, in september. The simpson index calculated from this is $ 0.002750224$, and the inverse is $363.6067$, so the "effective number of birthdays" is about 363 and a half, rather close to 366. So the nonuniformity maybe is not to important. It is more difficult to find data for deathday, but I found the paper https://tidsskriftet.no/2003/06/originalartikkel/dodelighet-i-norge-etter-tid-pa-aret-ukedag-og-fodselsdato (in norwegian) (this is the official journal of the norwegian medical association) they report around 12% higher rate of death in winter than in summer. They also  report a slightly increased risk of death at mondays! In fact, international comparisons reported by that paper shows that winter overmortality is lowest in scandinavia, in countries like Irland or England it about double. That might be surprising, might have to do with us scandinavians having warmer and better isolated houses.  From that we can reconstruct a deathday distribution. I take winter halfyear  as november-april. Then we can calculate
$$
p_w =1.12 p_s \\
(182 \cdot 1.12 + 184) p_s = 1
$$
leading to $p_s=0.002578383, p_w= 0.002887789$ and finally $\sum_i p_i q_i = 0.00273151$, its inverse, the "effective number of birthdays" being 366.1, pretty close to 366! The anticorrelation ($\rho(p_i,q_i)=-0.06$) seems to offset the nonuniformity in such a way that we could as well assume uniformity (and equal distribution for birthday and deathday). That is quite interesting.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 25 at 21:48       kjetil b halvorsen   21.8k 9 63 152              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      1 out of 365 would be the correct odds, because you are guaranteed to die on one day out of a 365 day year...

You should justify your assumption or otherwise address the information in the question and other answers to explain why it doesn't cause a problem for your assumption. There may be such an argument but you'd need to offer it, not just hope it's true. – Glen_b ♦  Feb 22 '17 at 0:28         2      On a unrelated point, we should clarify the terms used here.

(Image courtesy of Flickr user Brimstone , under a Creative Commons license)   It happened to actress Ingrid Bergman, women's rights activist Betty Friedan, and — tradition has it — William Shakespeare. They all died on their birthdays, and new research finds the typically joyous day turns out to be more tragic than expected for some.  The average death rate on people's birthdays is 6.7 percent higher than what you'd otherwise normally expect on that day, according to a new analysis from University of Chicago economics researcher Pablo Pena. The rate is even higher for young people and on weekends, he finds.  Pena analyzed Social Security Administration records for 25 million people who died between 1998 and 2011. Births and deaths don't happen evenly across the year, so Pena's analysis controls for seasonal patterns by comparing birthday death rates to what would be expected on a given day.  The Social Security records themselves don't provide information on the cause of deaths or characteristics of the departed. But some patterns do emerge.  For instance, young people between 20-29 years old have an excess death rate of 25.4 percent —perhaps a sign of birthday celebrations gone wrong. Excess death rates are slightly higher for birthdays falling on weekends across all age groups, Pena's the analysis finds, while the excess death rate for 20-29 year olds almost doubles to 48.3 percent.   The study isn't the first to cast a sad shadow on birthday celebrations. A 2012 study in the journal Annals of Epidemiology found a much higher probability (about 14 percent) that people over 60 will die on their birthdays. That study , which analyzed more than 2 million deaths, found that strokes and heart attacks rose 18.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, on birthdays. Tragically, the study also found a 34.9 percent increase in suicides and a 44 increase in deaths from falls.  Pena, whose results will be published in the February 2015 issue of Social Science & Medicine, writes that his study sample is about 10 times larger than the 2012 study. He says further research is needed into what's behind the link between birthdays and deaths, such as the causes and the socioeconomic factors, to drive a potential policy response to prevent these deaths.  "In principle, those policies could be as simple as campaigns to increase awareness of the risks associated with changes in behaviors on or around birthdays," he writes.  In other words, celebrate responsibly.                     Jason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.

These, I submit, are among the most optimistic people on Earth, because they look at odds of 1 in 195,249,054 and still envision themselves winning.   Yet some of these people play the other side of much shorter odds, walking outside in a thunderstorm, ignoring bees buzzing flowerbeds, riding bicycles, and going for a swim, all apparently comfortable in the odds against such activities bringing them harm. They might not be so confident if they knew the true odds.  According to the National Safety Council, your odds of dying of various causes are:   Heart disease, 1 in 6  Cancer, 1 in 7  Stroke, 1 in 28  Motor vehicle accidents, 1 in 88  Intentional self-harm, 1 in 112  Accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances, 1 in 130  Falls, 1 in 171  Car crashes, 1 in 303  Assault by firearm, 1 in 306  Pedestrian, 1 in 649  Motorcycle rider, 1 in 770  Accidental drowning, 1 in 1,123  Exposure to smoke, fire, 1 in 1,177  Pedalcyclist 1 in 4,717  Firearms discharge, 1 in 6,309  Air and space transport accidents, 1 in 7,032  Electrocution, 1 in 9,943  Excessive natural heat, 1 in 12,517  Cataclysmic storm, 1 in 46,044  Lightning, 1 in 84,079  Legal execution, 1 in 96,691  Dog attack, 1 in 120,864  Earthquake or other ground movement, 1 in 148,756  Flood, 1 in 175,803  Fireworks discharge, 1 in 386,766               ABOUT THE AUTHOR        Tom Barlow     Contributor   i                 Follow      I'm a cheapskate, and I don't mean that in a negative way.

Miller, Staff Writer | April 18, 2016 08:45am ET                            MORE           You're more likely to die on this day of the week.  Credit: Fer Gregory / Shutterstock.com     No, it's not spooky, creepy Halloween — the most deaths occur on regular old Saturdays.  Death can strike on any day of the week, but at Live Science we wanted to know if national data might reveal that some days are deadlier than others. To figure out which day of the week claims the most lives, we turned to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC's Wonder database contains data on all deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2014, and we found that, all told, there were more than 39 million deaths over the course of these 15 years. (Keep that time frame in mind as you read on — the numbers below represent the total number of deaths for this period.) [ The Odds of Dying ]  We found that, day by day, the breakdown was fairly equivocal, ranging from a low of 5.6 million total deaths on the Sundays during that period to a high of 5.7 million total deaths on the Saturdays of those years.  Moreover, the top 10 causes of death on each day lined up with the CDC's top 10 causes of death overall. In other words, no matter what day of the week we looked at, the top 10 causes of death were: heart disease , cancer , chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, strokes , Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, flu and pneumonia, kidney disease, and suicide.  So, nothing to see here? Not so fast. When we dug a little deeper, we found some interesting differences in the days that people die.        Mortality on Mondays  We found that deaths due to heart attacks peaked on Mondays, with a total of 348,206 fatal heart attacks reported by the CDC. Tuesday ranked second for heart attack deaths, with 337,918.  Interestingly, other research bears out this trend; a 2005 meta-analysis concluded that sudden cardiac deaths in the U.S. were more likely to occur on Mondays, regardless of people's age or sex.   Tuesdays  Tuesdays saw the highest number of deaths from the flu and pneumonia — 134,567 — though Wednesdays came in a very close second, with a total of 134,525 deaths from these diseases.  Deaths from car crashes , however, were the lowest on Tuesdays. Over the 15-year period, there were a total of 28,523 deaths from this cause on Tuesdays.   Wednesdays  Wednesdays fell smack dab in the middle for the total number of deaths that occurred over the time period: 5,606,470.   Thursdays  Though Thursdays didn't have the lowest total number of deaths overall, this day had the fewest deaths from heart attacks, diabetes and firearms.   Woeful weekends  Deaths from accidents peak on Saturdays and Sundays, with a total of 309,206 accident-related deaths on Saturdays and 289,248 on Sundays during the study period. And Fridays, with a total of 247,844 deaths from accidents, more closely resembled weekend days than weekdays. [ Understanding the 10 Most Destructive Human Behaviors ]  But accidents include many things. We looked deeper and found that the greatest number of car crash deaths occurred on Saturdays (42,332), followed by Sundays (39,943) and then Fridays (36,167).  Firearm deaths also peaked on the weekends, increasing from between 23,000 and 25,000 total on the different weekdays to more than 31,000 deaths during the Saturdays and Sundays of the study period. Here, Sunday had slightly higher numbers, with 32,314 firearm deaths, about 500 more than Saturday.  On a much smaller scale, the greatest number of deaths due to "contact with a venomous plant or animal" (that's the official term for it) also occurred on Saturdays. Over the 15-year period, there were a total of 216 reported deaths from a poison plant or animal on Saturdays, we found. Those numbered dropped off on Sundays, to the weekly low of 169 deaths.

The odds of dying on that day are higher than average, according to a study of millions of death records. The excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors, warned researchers.        Accident: New research suggests the excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors on birthdays Suicides triggered by the ‘birthday blues’ may also be to blame, said academics at Chicago University. Researcher Pablo Peña said the phenomenon could be due to people ‘deviating from their usual behaviour’ on their birthday.

Maybe you should take extra care on Christmas, New Year’s, your birthday and the days you get paid. On the Web site of Men’s Health magazine , Markham Heid assembles information from various studies that show days (or times of day) when you are more likely to shuffle off this mortal coil.  Your chances are 25 percent higher of dying on your birthday than the average day of the year, says economist Pablo Peña, author of one of those studies, who says “risky behaviors” involving alcohol, driving and stress are probably the cause.  For similar reasons, chances of dying also jump — though to a lesser degree — on the two big holidays we just passed, according to a different study. “More mystifying: Rates of death for all sorts of common diseases — from cancer to cardiovascular disease — also swell on the first day of the year,” Heid writes.  Several studies, including one from the University of Maryland, find that you are more likely to die soon after you get your paycheck. Again, increases in drinking and driving appear to be the cause.  As for the most lethal hour, Heid doesn’t really explain why — but if you’re reading this after 11 a.m., you’ve made it through the most dangerous time of day.

The US Social Security Administration keeps records of births and deaths and has their information available for purchase (apparently for a hefty price): Here  However I found a source that claims to have bought it and is offering it for free (as well as offering the data sorted by date on the site): Here  I'm assuming you can just use that as your sample and go through all the data with a script and find how many people actually die on their birthday. I would do that myself but I have 20 min left to download (they're about 1.5GB) so I'll try to get back to you on the statistics myself if I find the time to write up a script.  Of course the United States can't represent the entire world's population but it is a good start. I'm assuming you will see a higher rate in deaths on birthdays because of "first world problems" because we're using the United States and I think the effect would be less visible across the world...  Update - Numbers :D  I've ran through the Social Security Death Master File from the free source, so there's no way knowing if the information is valid. However, given the size that they're ~3 Gigabytes each and that there's no reason for anyone to spoof these kind of files... I'll assume they are valid.  You can see the code that I used to run through it here: http://pastebin.com/9wUFuvpN  It's written in C#, it reads through the lines of the death index one by one and then parses the date using regex. I assumed that the file was basically this format:  `(Social Security Number)(First Name)   (LastName)   (Middle Name)    (Some Letter)(MM-DD-YYYY of Death)(MM-DD-YYYY Of Birth)`  I had regex just pick out the last part for the dates of birth/death, check if any of the fields are just 0 (which I'm assuming it means that Social Security couldn't get a valid month/date for the record), and discard the 0's. Then it'll check if the day of birth and month of birth match the day of death/month of death and add that to the died on birthday count. It'll add all records that aren't 0's to the death count.  It outputs the results in this format:  Deaths On Birthday/Total Deaths   Lines Looked Through - People With a 0 in any of their record  It's be great if someone could double check that code, as I've found quite a few errors I've made before and could only tell because my results made no statistical sense.  Here is the console output:  Doing some math...   File 1 had 44665 Deaths on a Birthday out of 14879058 Deaths in Total  File 2 had 47060 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15278724 Deaths in Total  File 3 had 49289 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15374049 Deaths in Total  Total we have 141014 Deaths on a Birthday out of 45531831.   So we have ~0.3097% chance of dying on a birthday while statistically (1/365) would lead us to believe there is only ~0.27397% chance of dying on a birthday. That is indeed a 13% increase in chance of death on a birthday from 1/365. Of course this sample is only for Americans and only has 45 million records, I'm sure organizations who originally published their paper had access to much more reliable and larger death indexes. However, I think that it is indeed valid that deaths on a birthday is more likely than death on any other day.  Here's a Time article citing jumps in reasons for death on birthdays: Article  Edit 2: @cbeleites pointed out that I forgot to account for same day deaths, which would be a huge factor in increasing deaths on birthdays. Strictly speaking my data is still valid but I did not throw out if a person died on the same day they were born. It's interesting that my results were not affected too heavily by this error so it seems that these records don't include death on first day. I'll look into it later. I'm thinking there would be very interesting statistics I can look for such as death on days of the month and make a heatmap of some sort. I'll probably try to do that sometime...     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 30 '13 at 1:26             answered Dec 28 '13 at 16:53       Mike Shi   316 1 7                  Chances are the OP wanted the theoretical probability. – ndoogan  Dec 28 '13 at 17:00        6      No, this is interesting too.

Roughly speaking the relative uncertainty in these calculation is going to be about 1/sqrt(47000) = 0.5%. So these differences are not statistically significant. – Dave31415  Mar 13 '14 at 5:01        add a comment |              up vote  8  down vote      We can be even more precise than @Mike Shi's data: the most dangerous of all birthdays is the very first one .  The 1st day mortality rates reported there are around 0.2 % for industrialized countries and 0.8 % average for all countries. Which means that the risk of dying on the day of birth is at least as high as the risk of dying at any of the following birth days*.  * I think it is a safe assumption that 1st day deaths do not appear in @Mark Shi's file, as the US 1st day mortality rates are reported to be 0.3 % ( other source: 0.26 % ). Which is almost the total birth day death rate in the social security file. So either babies who die at the day of birth do not get a social security number, or dying on a birth day > 1 year is extremely improbable.   side note: There are other days, such as Chirstmas and New Years Eve which are known to have higher-than-average mortality rates as well .     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 29 '13 at 18:47       cbeleites   20k 40 91              2      Ah yes, I forgot to account for deaths that occur on the same day as the birth. I'm assuming this was excluded from the data as the hospital would have to submit this data to the state for a birth certificate and they wouldn't submit data on babies who die I'm assuming. This has lead me to a series of awkward Google searches... "do dead babies get a social security number"... oh search history. – Mike Shi  Dec 29 '13 at 21:09        add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      Here's an argument why the probability of death on the birthday may be higher than on other days: Birthdays are emotionally charged days. More over, people tend to celebrate it somehow.. So there is an excess of factors (relative to the person's usual life style) that increase biological stress (excess emotions, excess drinking, excess eating, excess dancing, excess banjee jumping etc). Statistically speaking, this situation increases the chances of dying on a birthday, since it intensifies any health issues a person may have, or because it exposes the person to situations and risks for which the person is inexperienced.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 28 '13 at 23:09             answered Dec 28 '13 at 18:44       Alecos Papadopoulos   38.8k 1 81 168              1      sure. but rather than speculate, let's measure :) – Hugh Perkins  Mar 26 at 2:06        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The probability that a newborn dies within a year can be found in the life tables.

That conspires such that the "statistical" probability is not 1/365.  To get an idea of this effect, lets first assume they are both almost uniform, only 29 february has a probability 1/4   of the others. That gives
$$
    365 p + \frac14 p=1
$$
so $p= 0.002737851$. That leads to probability of birth and death on the same day equal $356\cdot p^2 + (p/4)^2=  0.002736445  > 0.00273224=\frac1{366}$ which is the minimum possibe value (with 366 days).  With a bit more generality, let $p_i, i=1, \dotsc, n$ be the birtday probabilities, and $q_i, i=1,\dotsc,n$ the deathday probabilities, for a year with $n$ days. Then, if birtday and deathday for a person are statistically independent, we will find that
$$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}}
\P(\text{Birth and death on same day}) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i q_i
$$
so if $p_i=q_i$ then that is $\sum_i p_i^2$. That is a quantity known (in biology) as Simpsons index of (bio)diversity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index . Its inverse  could then be taken as "effective number of birthdays"! The minimum value of $\sum_i p_i^2$ is $1/n$. To see that use convexity.  But assuming $p_i=q_i$ is quite a stretch, lets first look at some data, birthday probabilities for Norway calculated from data from ssb.no:   Clearly not uniform, the high outlier is 1. july. That is not real, it is caused by immigrants without documented birthday registered that date. One max in spring, around beginning of april, another maximum in autumn, in september. The simpson index calculated from this is $ 0.002750224$, and the inverse is $363.6067$, so the "effective number of birthdays" is about 363 and a half, rather close to 366. So the nonuniformity maybe is not to important. It is more difficult to find data for deathday, but I found the paper https://tidsskriftet.no/2003/06/originalartikkel/dodelighet-i-norge-etter-tid-pa-aret-ukedag-og-fodselsdato (in norwegian) (this is the official journal of the norwegian medical association) they report around 12% higher rate of death in winter than in summer. They also  report a slightly increased risk of death at mondays! In fact, international comparisons reported by that paper shows that winter overmortality is lowest in scandinavia, in countries like Irland or England it about double. That might be surprising, might have to do with us scandinavians having warmer and better isolated houses.  From that we can reconstruct a deathday distribution. I take winter halfyear  as november-april. Then we can calculate
$$
p_w =1.12 p_s \\
(182 \cdot 1.12 + 184) p_s = 1
$$
leading to $p_s=0.002578383, p_w= 0.002887789$ and finally $\sum_i p_i q_i = 0.00273151$, its inverse, the "effective number of birthdays" being 366.1, pretty close to 366! The anticorrelation ($\rho(p_i,q_i)=-0.06$) seems to offset the nonuniformity in such a way that we could as well assume uniformity (and equal distribution for birthday and deathday). That is quite interesting.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 25 at 21:48       kjetil b halvorsen   21.8k 9 63 152              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      1 out of 365 would be the correct odds, because you are guaranteed to die on one day out of a 365 day year...

Could it be that your assumption that death is equally likely on every day might be flawed? Might it be, for example, that Alecos' suggested reason (in his answer) applies? You should justify your assumption or otherwise address the information in the question and other answers to explain why it doesn't cause a problem for your assumption. There may be such an argument but you'd need to offer it, not just hope it's true. – Glen_b ♦  Feb 22 '17 at 0:28         2      On a unrelated point, we should clarify the terms used here.

Should we include the actual dates in the event or just the time?  Should we account for possible errors in measuring the time?  Should the odds be conditional on the fact that you were born and that he was born?  Should the event account for the grandparent-grandson relationship?  What population should it apply to?  Should it account for the fact that 19:56 is (mathematically) a very special time or not? – whuber ♦  Jul 20 '16 at 14:16        1      A major difficulty with assessing how unusual an event like this is, is that these events are never specified before-the-event, but only after the event -- these are always data-generated hypotheses (see also p-hacking, data-dredging). Treating the hypothesis of interest and the data that led us to it as if they had arrived independently of each other leads to nonsensically low answers. Usually there's no good way of actually arriving at a reasonable answer to such questions (on occasion however we can sometimes figure out a way to give an approximate answer to such questions). – Glen_b ♦  Jul 22 '16 at 0:34        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote      In a world with 7 billion people (not counting the many more people who have died), and with a calendar with only 366 dates, the probability of such an event happening at least once was approximately 1.

If you are looking for a rigorously true and statistically backed statement to tell your grandson how special he is and make him interested in numbers at the same time, my answer would be as follows:  If you take another person at random, the probability of that person have been boon in the same calendar year as you is roughly 1/365.25.  The probability of having been born in the time coded by your birth year (that is, 19:56 if you were born in 1956) is 1/(24*60), that is 1/1440. Here I'm making the simplification that your birth year encodes a time, which doesn't hold for people born between 1960 and 1999, but I think I can do this simplification because:   Taking it in account would reduce the probability and make your grandson even more special, so we are keeping our numbers in the safe side.  Since we are interested in grandmas and grandsons and I expect that most grandmas of 2008 born grandsons were born before 1960, the correction wouldn't be as dramatic as it my seem.   Then, the probability of a random person being born in the same calendar day and the hour encoded by your birth year is about 1/(365.25*1440), that is 1 on 525960.  Since grandsons have two grandmas each, only one on 262980 will show such a coincidence - and that looks as a tiny probability, so you and your grandson can appreciate how lucky you have been. Furthermore, this probability only holds for grandsons with two grandmas born before 1960; for grandsons with two grandmas born after 1960 that probability is exactly zero, so you can feel still more special.  Now maybe you want to stop reading, because my second answer will be about discussing how special is being so special, and I'm afraid @Kodiologist is right.  1 out of 262980 is a tiny probability, but it's no so tiny compared with the population of most countries or the population of the Earth. Therefore:   About 13300 people on Earth were born in October 10th at 19:56 (of different years).  About 25000 people on Earth may have such a date and time combination with one of their grandmas - although I'm overestimating the number here because I'm not taking on account that some living people have grandmas born in 1860-1899 or 1960-1999.  That date twist is just one of several possible twists. There are a lot more people who can claim a similarly special link by other twists (e.g. same day, same hour, or twist between day and hour as February 10th and 02:10, and so).  What would actually be very special is to have such a date twist with both grandmas. The probability to exist a person in the Earth showing such a coincidence is below 3%.   Anyway, don't forget to remind your grandson that he is special because of how much you love him, and that no statistics can account for that.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 21 '16 at 23:16             answered Jul 20 '16 at 9:12       Pere   3,599 1 6 16              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

We've argued before about the probabilities and I am still not satisfied. My point was that the chances are tiny if you consider the probabilities of being in a relationship (+ being successful at it for X amount of time). I find the amount of factors to take into account quite vast (up to a point, gender and age, availability, probabilities of separation in our region, etc.)  Is it even possible to calculate the probabilities on something like this?

If you had that probability, P(Same day and same year) = P(Same year) $\times$ P(Same day|same year). But P(same day) should be roughly independent of whether you were born in the same year.

If you add in year, it's probably something like 1 in 3000 or 4000 (most people have relationships with people relatively close in age).  But that' a priori.  That is, if you had asked, before meeting your current boyfriend "What are the odds that the next man I have a relationship with will be born on same day and year?" the odds would have been 1 in 3000 or so.  However, post hoc (that is, while in the relationship) it's trickier because you would have noticed a lot of other coincidences too: My boyfriend was born the day before me!  My boyfriend's mother has the same name as my mother!" etc etc.  The odds of "some weird connection with my boyfriend" are impossible to calculate.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 11 '14 at 17:43       Peter Flom ♦   68.8k 9 97 186              44      @Emilie multiply $1/3000$ by the probability of having a successful relationship.

From experience I'd guess around 20% or so, no way to seriously calculate that, but no matter what it exactly is, just want to be clear having a special weird connection means nothing (though it is fun).  Then, something the other didn't take into account, looking at birth rates per month   we get a nice overview (it's caused by things like people being off thus having a lot of free time on hand 9 months before the months in question), next dividing that percentage by the number of days in that month.  Next one should figure out what the chance is of being born in the same year. Just to give an impression of this chance I'd start with the rule of thumb as presented by xkcd which gives a dating age range of $\pm \ age-\frac{age}{2}+7$, where age $=$ age you started dating. Which in turn gives $P(same\  year)=\frac{1}{pool\ size}$. However, the chances of dating someone from the exact same year are far greater due to a flaw in the educational system where pooling is done by the date of conception . A consequence of this is that the pool of people you know from the exact same ages is by guesstimation a factor of 5 bigger than the expected value, if $age<24$ or so.  What that exactly boils down to depends on age and month born, but for me it boiled down to more than 0.2% (1 in 500). Definitely not normal, but then again, coming full circle, you will find something like that for everyone after the fact.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 12 '14 at 0:12       David Mulder   235 2 9              1      I'm told disproportionally many babies are born just before new year in The Netherlands, where a 31 December birth is financially advantageous over a 1 January birth, due to the way benefits are calculated.

If you had that probability, P(Same day and same year) = P(Same year) $\times$ P(Same day|same year).  But P(same day) should be roughly independent of whether you were born in the same year. So it will be $\approx$ P(Same year) $\times$ P(Same day).  So if you had some good estimate of P(Same year), you can calculate the overall probability reasonably well.  I'd guess that P(same year) is roughly of the order of 0.1 to 0.2, but that's just a guess.

Thus, a baseline estimate for sharing the same date of birth would be the above statistic divided by two (because it captures 2 years) for sharing the same year multiplied by the probability of sharing the same birthday:  $$P(DOB_i=DOB_j)\approx \frac{0.332}{2} \times \frac{1}{365} = 0.00045$$  Or roughly 1 in 2200.  As has been noted, both the shared year and shared birthday probabilities could be further refined based on additional information.   Probability of shared year: The distribution of age differences in relationships varies based on many factors including culture and time. Also, the above statistic is for a year difference. Dividing by two might lead to an underestimation because the probability of being within six months of age is probably more than half the probability of being within a year.  Shared date of birth: There could be tweaks to this. In particular, the uneven distribution of births throughout the year could have a small effect. If you're born in a leap year, then you have 366 as the base divisor. Then there is the elusive effect that being born on the same day might have on you both. In particular, if you are a person who reads into such things and searches for coincidences, such a coincidence might subtly increase your chances of staying together.   Thinking about other coincidences  When it comes to two people, there are many potential sources of coincidences. Humans are very good at identifying patterns. Within the domain of date of births, you could imagine many possible similarities: same month; same day of month; same star sign; same birthday, different year; some similarity in the numbers such as 2nd of May and 5th of February; dates are some round number apart (e.g., 8th of May 18th of May); dates are only only some small number apart (e.g., 8th and 9th of May). We could in some sense describe our sense to which any of these feel surprising or like a major coincidence.  But of course, when we speak about coincidences there is a much wide domain of search. For example, we could look at similarities in names, employment history, appearance, etc. The larger you cast the search, the more possible bases there are for finding coincidences.  In general, the more you look for them, the more you will see them. This is analogous to the analyst who performs many post-hoc statistical tests without correcting alpha. With enough analyses, the probability of finding a significant pattern gets close to one even when alpha is small.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 14 '14 at 6:42             answered Mar 14 '14 at 4:25       Jeromy Anglim   31.1k 15 112 218              add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Although the question is about birthdays, the "birthday paradox" isn't really relevant here. It's about how many random samples you need to take before you expect at least two samples among them to be equal (a collision). Your question is mostly about the probability of two samples being equal. If there were 30 people in your relationship then you'd expect two of them to share a birthday but there aren't 30 people, there are only 2.  The odds of having a relationship only have quite a small effect. Most people have a relationship at one time or another. I'd guess more than half of adults have one right at this moment. Some people have several at once, mentioning no Présidents de la République  in particular ;-) So it's not going to massively reduce the odds, maybe halve them.  The main consideration is, given this significant person, what is the probability of them sharing your birthday? On pure chance it'd be roughly 1/365 given that the person in question exists at all. Since you choose a partner based on everything you know about them, which includes their birthday, you can't discount the possibility that the actual incidence is significantly higher or lower.  Look at it another way: what's the chance of there being someone who delivers your post and shares your birthday? The chance of a randomly-selected person being the one who delivers your post is tiny, but so what if it is? It doesn't affect the answer. Assuming universal delivery (which I can in my country), someone delivers my post. If there's only one then the answer is roughly 1/365. We can completely exclude from consideration all the people who don't deliver my post, they don't affect the odds no matter how many of them there are.  What's the chance that you have a partner who shares your birthday? It's about 1/365, times the chance you have a partner. Then adjusted by any factors that mean sharing your birthday is correlated or anti-correlated with dating you.  What's the chance that your boyfriend shares your birthday? Well the question pretty much assumes that you have a boyfriend, so strike that part from consideration!  To incorporate the year you need to look at the way the age differences in relationships are distributed. As a rough guess, I'd look at what proportion of relationships have an age difference of less than a year, and multiply my previous number by that. Of course, if you have access to that kind of data you might just be able to look at what proportion of relationships match your criteria, and get the exact frequency without estimating anything :-)  In a society where there's a strong tradition that the man should be somewhat older than the woman in a relationship, you might find that the proportion of age differences below a year is very small, and the proportion couples who share date and year of birth is tiny. This could be the case even if the average age difference is just a couple of years. So maybe you are special, by bucking society's rules. Myself, I'd guess that the proportion of relationships with an age difference less than a year is probably over 10%. But I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong and besides, a lot of my friends met their partners at university, which clearly affects the age difference among the available candidates and that biases what I see to make my guess. Everyone's equal in modern society (right?), but "the man a couple of years older than the woman" is probably a stereotype for a reason.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 13 '14 at 16:26             answered Mar 13 '14 at 15:59       Steve Jessop   161 5                  I totally agree that the man having to be older is a dated stereotype...still, said bf seemed somewhat relieved when we compared birth hours as he is the eldest :-) – Emilie  Mar 13 '14 at 16:08            @Emilie: you could take your age into consideration when estimating your chances. It might be that couples formed 50+ years ago have a very different age-difference distribution from couples formed now, and so your coincidence is becoming more common over time and your chances are better than your grandparents's chances were. – Steve Jessop  Mar 13 '14 at 16:09         add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      The chances for this to happen.... two people having their birthday on the same day as explained by the other posters is 1/365 * 1/30 to be conservative here with the age ranges. To be in a relationship, a successful one multiply by maybe 1/2 or 1/3?!  However, for you to be in a relationship, you first have to be here. For you to be here, your mom and dad needed to get together - how likely was that then? Then their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, predecessors, apes, fish, amoebas, rays of sun hitting the first predecessors to plants, back to the big bang going as it did and whatever was before it. If you consider all, then every atom in the universe had to be exactly the way it was for you to be there.  You could almost say it's a miracle you guys got together.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 12 '14 at 17:34       n13   131 3              add a comment |         protected by gung ♦  Mar 18 '14 at 18:22   Thank you for your interest in this question.

Yet researchers who have studied more than two million people over the course of two decades have found that the term might be apt: we are more likely to die on our own birthday than any other day of the year.  ( MORE :  Got Plaque? It May Be Linked with Early Cancer Death )   The study, published in the journal Annals of Epidemiology , found that people over 60 were 14% more likely to die on their birthdays than on any other day. The most common causes of birthday deaths were heart attacks, which rose 18.6% on birthdays, and strokes, which were up 21.5%. There is also a 34.9% rise in suicide, and a remarkable 44% jump for deaths by falling down.  Or perhaps people are keen to emulate famous birthday-perishers William Shakespeare, who died on his birthday on April 23 1616, and actress Ingrid Bergman, who also left on the anniversary of the day she arrived, in August 1982.  Prof. Richard Wiseman, a University of Hertfordshire psychologist, explained to The Daily Telegraph :  “There are two camps – one is the camp that suggests you eat too much and your getting on a bit and that causes you to die. The other is a placebo effect. You are knife-edged on death. And you kept yourself going until your birthday. You think ‘that’s it, I’ve had enough, I’m out of here.”  Happy birthday, everyone. And please be careful out there.

Researchers have found that an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, falls and suicides makes our birthdays a far more dangerous day of the year than any other.  Alamy Legitimate research has suggested that your birthday could be the most dangerous day of the year  A study of two million people found that over-60s were 14 per cent more likely to die on their birthday, with a staggering 44 per cent jump in fall deaths on the big day.  At the time of publishing the study, Dr Vladeta Ajdacic-Gross of the University of Zurich said: "Birthdays end lethally more frequently than might be expected."  As chilling as it sounds, the sinister findings have been backed up by Canadian research into birthday deaths as well.  It emerged that stroke risks are higher than average on birthdays, particularly among people with high blood pressure.  Alamy A study of people who died on their big day has revealed that stroke, heart attack and fall risks all spike on birthdays  Psychologist prof Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, told the Telegraph : "It seems to be a valid finding.  "There are two camps - one is the camp that suggests you eat too much and you're getting on a bit and that causes you to die.  "The other is a placebo effect. You are knife-edged on death. And you kept yourself going until your birthday. You think 'that's it I've had enough I'm out of here'."  However, it's not just birthdays which have a habit of going south - there are other dangerous days to watch out for as well.  Alamy Take care next time your birthday comes around - it's the deadliest date of all  For one, studies have shown that New Year's Day is one of the deadliest dates on any calendar, with a far higher risk of death than any normal day.   DEAD INTRIGUING This interactive graph can predict what's most likely to kill you   University of California researchers found that 5 per cent more people die from natural causes on January 1 than any other day.  Other studies have also pointed to an increased risk of accidents over the festive period - with Christmas day another dangerous date.  It's not yet known for sure why birthdays and New Year's Day are so dangerous - but you may want to take extra care if your birthday happens to fall on January 1.

But why should that be? As the researchers put it, "birthdays… appear to end up in a lethal way more frequently than expected ." This is not a joke. The study was carried out by legitimate scientists who analysed data from 2.5 million deaths in Switzerland between 1969 and 2008. There are a number of hypotheses which may explain the finding. Perhaps some people close to death "hang on" until their birthday, to reach another milestone? Or perhaps a significant number of people take greater risks on their birthdays, like driving home from their own parties drunk?     But Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician from Cambridge University, says the Swiss data does not support the "hanging on" theory.  More or Less: Behind the stats  Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast  Download the More or Less podcast  More stories from More or Less  "They don't find any dip before so there's no holding on," he says, "and they don't find any blip after, so there's no jumping the gun. It's purely a birthday effect." The Swiss data, he says, suggests "something on your birthday kills you". The University of Zurich's Dr Vladeta Ajdacic-Gross, who led the study, says the data on birthday deaths shows the risk of death is greater for certain causes, like accidents and suicide. But Spiegelhalter sees no evidence for this. As far as he is concerned, the data "is compatible with a uniform 14% blip on all causes, all ages, both sexes". So he offers an alternative hypothesis - that some of the death registration records used by the researchers were simply inaccurate.      Image caption  When birth and death dates match, it may sometimes be a mistake...   "This is a very big study. There are 2.5 million deaths they've looked at," he says. "But if we actually look at what the excess is, it's 900 deaths in which people have been registered to have the same birth date as death date. That's not that many out of 2.5 million. "Now maybe I'm getting sceptical in my old age but this is only to do with matching registrations. The Swiss are, I'm sure, very precise book-keepers. But it's possible that someone could have a matching birth date and death date in their record when that wasn't actually the case." One can imagine how such an error might occur. What if the birth date of a deceased person was unknown? Someone might use their death date as the birth date too, just to fill the box. Then there's pure accident - someone in a hurry might write the same date in both boxes by mistake. If such mistakes occurred in just 0.04% of death records, the entire effect could be explained away.      Image caption  Might people be holding out for a milestone birthday?   "I'm not saying that's what happened," says Spiegelhalter. "But for me to be convinced about this frankly rather implausible finding, I'd want to see [the researchers] go back to every single match and double-check." Ajdacic-Gross concedes that administrative errors could be to blame for some of the spike in deaths on birthdays. If you take a "worst-case scenario" for the frequency of errors in the death registration system, he says, the excess risk of dying on your birthday drops to around 4%. This, he argues, is still a significant result. And despite Spiegelhalter's concerns about this particular study, there is some evidence that people close to death can have some influence over the date of their departure. The economists Joshua Gans and Andrew Leigh published a paper in 2006 which examined the effect on death rates of a change in Australian tax law.  Are you a risk-taker?   Lab UK's Big Risk Test takes about 25 minutes  Includes attitudes to luck  Asks users to weigh risks of activities such as air travel, gardening and smoking   Take the Big Risk Test  Aitken and Spiegelhalter on luck and risk  In 1978 the Australian government decided to abolish estate taxes - or inheritance tax. The estates of anyone who died on or after 1 July 1979 would escape tax. The estates of anyone who died before that date would not. The data suggests a significant number of deaths were "postponed" long enough to avoid paying tax. If the very ill are able to move their date of death forwards as well as backwards, says Joshua Gans, "any country that introduces an inheritance tax should expect a spike in the death rate in the week before the law takes effect."

Birthday effect   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   For the mathematical coincidence, see Birthday problem .  "Birthday blues" redirects here. For the movie, see Birthday Blues . For the album, see Birthday Blues (album) .     The actress Ingrid Bergman was born 29 August 1915 and died 29 August 1982 from breast cancer.    The birthday effect (sometimes called the birthday blues , especially when referring specifically to suicide ) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their birthday . The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in England and Wales , [1]  Switzerland , [2] [3]  Ukraine , [4] and the United States , [5] [6] as well as in smaller populations such as Major League Baseball players. [7] Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday, [5] while others find no significant gender effect. [8] [9] Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased mortality salience , or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.

[7]    With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on February 29 , there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts. [5]  A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80; [2] another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: heart attack and stroke (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths. [3] Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%. [6] An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women. [4] Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players [7] and people with entries in the Encyclopedia of American History . [5]  Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in Denmark [10] and Hungary , [11] but not in Bavaria [12] or Taiwan . [12]  However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and Austria (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday. [8] A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect. [9] A small study by Leonard Zusne found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole. [13] The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but it was not seen in the population as a whole . [1]  Possible explanations [ edit ]  External causes [ edit ]  Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. Binge drinking can increase an individual's risk of death through alcohol poisoning , accidents and drunk driving , as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk. [4] [11] In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents. [14] [15]  Psychosomatic and psychological [ edit ]  See also: Mortality salience  Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on psychosomatic effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life. [5] [16] According to the terror management theory , this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the public sphere of life (for example, career -driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the private sphere (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on. [5] [7] [16] Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering suicidal ideation will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve. [11]  The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as Christmas , [9] and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a Passover effect among the Jewish community (which moves with the festival itself ), and a Mid-Autumn Festival effect among the Chinese. [5] [16]  Physiological [ edit ]  It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour circadian rhythm , the body also has a yearly "circannual" biological rhythm . Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a zeitgeber that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death. [4]  Statistical [ edit ]  It is possible when processing death certificates to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide. [5] Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders. [17] These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.

The site, DeathRiskRankings.com , is the brainchild of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides answers based on publicly available data from the United States and Europe, comparing mortality risks by gender, age, cause of death and geographic region. Put your info in, and it produces the probable causes of your demise and provides insight on the timing of that unfortunate event.  The site can compare such things as the odds of death next year by breast cancer for, say, a 54-year-old Pennsylvania woman or her counterpart in the United Kingdom.  Of course the results produced by the web site speak to groups of people and cannot predict with accuracy when you might actually kick the bucket . The timing of your own end is based on many uncharted factors, from heredity to lifestyle to untimely accidents.  But noodling around with the interface can be enlightening, if not frightening.  "It turns out that the British woman has a 33 percent higher risk of breast cancer death. But for lung/throat cancer, the results are almost reversed, and the Pennsylvania woman has a 29 percent higher risk," explained Paul Fischbeck, site developer and professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.  "Most Americans don't have a particularly good understanding of their own mortality risks , let alone ranking of their relevant risks," said David Gerard, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon who is now an associate professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.  The researchers found that beyond infancy, the risk of dying increases annually at an exponential rate.  A 20-year-old U.S. woman has a 1 in 2,000 (or 0.05 percent) chance of dying in the next year, for example. By age 40, the risk is three times greater; by age 60, it is 16 times greater; and by age 80, it is 100 times greater (around 1 in 20 or 5 percent).  "The risks are higher, but still not that bad," Gerard said. "At 80, the average U.S. woman still has a 95 percent chance of making it to her 81st birthday."  Other results for queries about dying within the year:  For every age group, men have a much higher annual death risk than women. For 20-year-olds, the risk is 2.5 to three times greater for men. Men are much more prone to accidents, homicides and suicides, and the risk of dying from heart disease is always higher for men than women, peaking in the 50s when men are 2.5 times at greater risk of dying.  Women's cancer risks are higher than men's in their 30s and 40s.  For heart disease and cancer, U.S. blacks have a much higher death risk than U.S. whites. Overall, blacks in their 30s and 40s are twice as likely to die within the year as their white counterparts. Only for suicides, do whites consistently exceed blacks, where whites typically have two to three times greater chances of dying.  For 20-year-old males, 80 percent of their death risks are from accidents, homicides and suicides. By age 50, however, these causes make up less than 10 percent and heart disease is No. 1, accounting for more than 30 percent of all deaths.   Obesity-related death risks are much higher in the United States than in Europe. For example, the annual diabetes death risk in the United States is three times that found in northern Europe for 60 year olds.  Fischbeck and Gerard hope the site will add information to the U.S. healtchcare debate .  "We believe that this tool, which allows anyone to assess their own risk of dying and to compare their risks with counterparts in the United States and Europe, could help inform the public and constructively engage them in the debate," Fischbeck said.
