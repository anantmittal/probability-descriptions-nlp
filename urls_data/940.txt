Will You Live To Be 100?  Life expectancy is up as people are living longer than ever before, thanks to a number of factors including improvements in health science and technology. However, living to the age of 100 remains a remarkable and somewhat rare feat. Individuals aged 100 or older, referred to as centenarians, make up less than one percent of the U.S. population. What are the odds that you’ll live to age 100?  What Centenarians and Life Expectancy Tell Us Today  According to the U.S. Census Special Report on Centenarians, in 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the United States or 1.73 per 10,000 people in the total population. The Centenarian Special Report also shed light on a few interesting facts about centenarians alive today:    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT        Geography Matters  To start with, the United States falls behind other developed countries in terms of the proportion of centenarians to the total population:      Country Centenarian Share of the Total Population      Japan 3.43 per 10,000    France 2.70 per 10,000    United Kingdom 1.95 per 10,000    Sweden 1.92 per 10,000    United States 1.73 per 10,000      Moreover, there are regional differences within the United States. Centenarians comprise a higher proportion of the total regional population in the Midwest and Northeast and a lower share in South and the West.  The Odds Dramatically Higher for Women Than Men  While life expectancy has risen overall, women continue to live longer than men, a trend that is reinforced in current data on centenarians. Women make up 82.8% of individuals age 100 years and older while men make up just 17.2%.  The Odds of Living to 100 Change Over Time, Generational Cohort  Overall, the trend for life expectancy is one of increase. Since 1970, life expectancy in the U.S. has risen by nearly a decade, from 70.8 years to 79 years today. Additionally, in 2011 in the United Kingdom (where life expectancy is 81 years old, roughly two years higher than in United States), the Department for Work and Pensions released a report listing the chances of living to age 100 by year of birth:   Search by Year of Birth     Year of Birth Male Female Both Sexes      1912 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1913 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1914 0.30% 1.20% 0.70%    1915 0.30% 1.20% 0.80%    1916 0.40% 1.30% 0.80%    1917 0.40% 1.40% 0.90%    1918 0.50% 1.60% 1.10%    1919 0.70% 1.90% 1.30%    1920 0.60% 1.80% 1.20%    1921 0.70% 2.10% 1.40%    1922 0.80% 2.30% 1.60%    1923 1.00% 2.50% 1.70%    1924 1.10% 2.70% 1.90%    1925 1.20% 3.00% 2.10%    1926 1.40% 3.20% 2.30%    1927 1.60% 3.50% 2.50%    1928 1.70% 3.80% 2.80%    1929 2.00% 4.20% 3.10%    1930 2.30% 4.60% 3.40%    1931 2.50% 5.10% 3.80%    1932 2.90% 5.60% 4.20%    1933 3.20% 6.20% 4.70%    1934 3.60% 6.80% 5.20%    1935 4.00% 7.30% 5.60%    1936 4.30% 7.90% 6.10%    1937 4.60% 8.40% 6.50%    1938 5.00% 8.90% 6.90%    1939 5.20% 9.30% 7.20%    1940 5.40% 9.60% 7.50%    1941 5.70% 9.90% 7.80%    1942 6.00% 10.30% 8.10%    1943 6.20% 10.60% 8.40%    1944 6.40% 10.90% 8.60%    1945 6.60% 11.10% 8.90%    1946 6.90% 11.50% 9.20%    1947 7.10% 11.80% 9.50%    1948 7.40% 12.20% 9.80%    1949 7.70% 12.50% 10.10%    1950 7.90% 12.80% 10.40%    1951 8.20% 13.10% 10.60%    1952 8.40% 13.50% 10.90%    1953 8.60% 13.70% 11.20%    1954 8.80% 14.00% 11.40%    1955 9.10% 14.40% 11.70%    1956 9.30% 14.70% 12.00%    1957 9.50% 14.90% 12.20%    1958 9.80% 15.20% 12.50%    1959 10.00% 15.60% 12.80%    1960 10.20% 15.90% 13.10%    1961 10.50% 16.20% 13.30%    1962 10.70% 16.50% 13.60%    1963 11.00% 16.80% 13.90%    1964 11.20% 17.10% 14.20%    1965 11.50% 17.40% 14.50%    1966 11.80% 17.70% 14.70%    1967 12.00% 18.10% 15.00%    1968 12.30% 18.40% 15.30%    1969 12.50% 18.70% 15.60%    1970 12.80% 19.00% 15.90%    1971 13.10% 19.40% 16.20%    1972 13.30% 19.70% 16.50%    1973 13.60% 20.00% 16.80%    1974 13.90% 20.40% 17.10%    1975 14.20% 20.70% 17.40%    1976 14.50% 21.10% 17.80%    1977 14.80% 21.40% 18.10%    1978 15.10% 21.70% 18.40%    1979 15.40% 22.10% 18.70%    1980 15.70% 22.40% 19.10%    1981 16.00% 22.80% 19.40%    1982 16.30% 23.10% 19.70%    1983 16.60% 23.50% 20.10%    1984 17.00% 23.80% 20.40%    1985 17.30% 24.20% 20.70%    1986 17.60% 24.50% 21.10%    1987 17.90% 24.90% 21.40%    1988 18.20% 25.30% 21.70%    1989 18.50% 25.60% 22.10%    1990 18.90% 26.00% 22.40%    1991 19.20% 26.40% 22.80%    1992 19.50% 26.70% 23.10%    1993 19.90% 27.10% 23.50%    1994 20.20% 27.50% 23.80%    1995 20.50% 27.80% 24.20%    1996 20.90% 28.20% 24.50%    1997 21.20% 28.50% 24.90%    1998 21.50% 28.90% 25.20%    1999 21.90% 29.30% 25.60%    2000 22.20% 29.60% 25.90%    2001 22.60% 30.00% 26.30%    2002 22.90% 30.40% 26.60%    2003 23.20% 30.70% 27.00%    2004 23.60% 31.10% 27.30%    2005 23.90% 31.50% 27.70%    2006 24.30% 31.80% 28.10%    2007 24.60% 32.20% 28.40%    2008 25.00% 32.60% 28.80%    2009 25.30% 32.90% 29.10%    2010 25.70% 33.30% 29.50%    2011 26.00% 33.70% 29.90%      Our odds of living to 100 are dramatically better than those of our grandparents, and babies born today have it even better.

Jun 23, 2015      More than three out of five 65-year-olds today will reach age 80.    Rising life expectancy and potentially exorbitant long-term care costs have increased the financial resources required to support oneself and one’s spouse in retirement and old age.  Americans today are living longer than did previous generations, thanks to advances in medicine and changes in lifestyle. As shown in the dark green bars, 50 years ago a man who had reached 65 had an 81 percent chance of reaching 70, a 41 percent chance of hitting 80, and a 10 percent chance of turning 90. By comparison, the chances of reaching those same ages for a man who reaches 65 in 2015 are (as shown in the light green bars) 90 percent, 62 percent, and 22 percent, respectively. Put differently, the likelihood of a 65-year-old man seeing his 80th birthday has increased by 50 percent, and the likelihood of him seeing his 90th birthday has more than doubled. Women live longer than men on average, and they have experienced smaller but still substantial gains in life expectancy over the past 50 years.

years ago I went into the studio and recorded a 56-minute video for
teenagers called "Three Keys To Greatness." Although my focus was for
teenagers, the principles I shared certainly apply to adults as well.  Recently I was asked to list these three things using one to two sentences for each.  Now for your benefit here they are again.  1) Setting Goals. I call it the view of the future. Most people, including kids, will pay
the price if they can see the promise of the future. So we need to help
our kids see a well-defined future, so they will be motivated to pay
the price today to attain the rewards of tomorrow. Goals help them do
this.  2) Personal Development. Simply making consistent investments in our self-education and
knowledge banks pays major dividends throughout our lives. I suggest
having a minimum amount of time set aside for reading books, listening
to audiocassettes, attending seminars, keeping a journal and spending
time with other successful people. Charlie Tremendous Jones says you
will be in five years the sum total of the books you read and the
people you are around.  3) Financial Planning. I call it the 70/30 plan. After receiving your paycheck or paying
yourself, simply setting aside 10% for saving, 10% for investing and
10% for giving, and over time this will guarantee financial
independence for a teenager.  If
a young person, or for that matter an adult, focused on doing these
three simple things over a long period of time I believe they will be
assured success!  To Your Success, Jim Rohn          Brought to you by:     Jeffrey N.

A picture taken on July 22, 2013, shows an old women walking in a corridor of the Ehpad retirement home "Maison d'Aquitaine" in Merignac, southwestern France, during a visit of French Junior Minister for the Elderly.     AFP PHOTO / NICOLAS TUCAT        (Photo credit should read NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP/Getty Images)  AFP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     (MoneyWatch) Many people say they want to live a long time, but they don't really understand the financial implications of that wish. If you don't make the necessary monetary preparations for a long life, you could end up penniless and have to rely on family or the government safety net for support.  How long will you live?  Estimate your life expectancy -- change your life Experts warn of retirement crisis So how long might you live? This post follows up my last post , which discussed a recent report from the American Academy of Actuaries that addressed longevity risk -- the risk of living beyond your life expectancy.  The report, " Risky Business: Living Longer Without Income for Life ," contains estimates from the Social Security Administration tables of life expectancies for individuals currently age 65. According to the report, a man age 65 can expect to live a further 18.9 years on average; a 65-year-old woman can expect to be alive an additional 20.9 years. These life expectancies have increased by about five years since 1935, when the Social Security program was implemented (longer lifespans are one cause of Social Security's current financing issues).  But these life expectancies are just averages. What are the odds of beating the averages?  The "Risky Business" report shows that a 65-year-old man has about one in five odds of living to age 90 -- about six years longer than his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has almost one in three odds of living to age 90 -- four years longer than her life expectancy. And a 65-year-old couple has a 45 percent chance -- almost 50-50 -- that one of them will survive to age 90.  The Social Security tables represent the population at large, including people who smoke or work in unhealthy environments. How do the odds improve if you take care of your health? The report calculates the odds if you experience mortality rates -- the odds of dying in a year -- that are 75 percent of those on the Social Security's tables. These lower mortality rates can apply to you if you have above average education, a regular job, don't smoke, keep your weight at healthy levels, eat nutritious food and/or get regular exercise. If you die at these reduced mortality rates, you'll live longer than the population at large.  In this case, the odds are almost one in three that a 65-year-old man will live to age 90 and about one in eight that he'll live until age 95 -- 11 years beyond his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has 42 percent odds of living to age 90, and 21 percent odds (more than one in five) of living to age 95 -- nine years beyond her life expectancy.  The odds are 31 percent -- almost one in three -- that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to age 95. The odds are one in 10 -- 10 percent -- that one member of this couple will live to age 100.  But most people aren't financially prepared to live that long or deal with the uncertainty of their actual lifespan. Retirement planning would be easier if you knew exactly how long you'll live. So what can you do to protect yourself against the risk of living too long? Stay tuned for my next post.   © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Find out the eight secrets to a longer, healthier and fuller life   by Alanna Glassman Updated Sep 22, 2014   8                         Katharine Weber was born the same year a test aircraft, with wings of steel, silk and electrical tape, took off from an ice field in Baddeck, Nova Scotia. It was 1909, and it’s fitting that Katharine, who would become an intrepid world traveller, should share her birth year with Canada’s first flight.  Katharine celebrates her 103rd birthday this month. And a look at her life shows just how much can happen in a century. She was a child when tanks rolled across French battlefields in the First World War, she survived Canada’s Spanish-flu epidemic, and in her 20s was a secretary for a shipping company during the Great Depression.  She got married at 38 and, craving adventure, jetted off with her new husband to the Colombian rainforest in South America, where they lived until Katharine became pregnant with their first of two sons. Later, after her kids left home, she started travelling in earnest, with trips to Russia, Europe and Australia. At 82, she walked the Great Wall of China.  Often when we think of the elderly, we think of the frail and infirm, the grouchy or senile. We see aging as a losing battle, but Katharine is proof that it doesn’t have to be. She lives in the same house in Winnipeg where she raised her sons. She’s always been an avid gardener and last summer enjoyed fresh tomatoes from her backyard. She even entertains weekly and calculates her taxes at the close of every year.  On her 100th birthday, Katharine’s younger son toasted her full life. “When I think of how it must feel to live through general strikes, pandemics, world wars, cold wars — and two sons — my first thought is, I’d need some rest,” says Thomas Weber. “But I look at Mum, and she’s still going strong — sometimes baking cookies or on her hands and knees at midnight, scrubbing the floor.”  One large long-term study of people over 100 years old shows centenarians share many traits, tendencies and traditions, even when living oceans apart. Not surprisingly, Katharine embraces many of these healthy habits. And she’s reaped the rewards with almost no health complaints — even now she doesn’t rely on daily medications and hardly ever wears her glasses.  But aging is a complex process. And while many of the body’s genes begin to break down once you hit 40, mounting research suggests there are things you can do to slow it down. “Science shows we aren’t completely at the mercy of genetics,” says pharmacist and longevity expert Farid Wassef, author of Breaking the Age Barrier .  “We know that because of a study that reviewed the lifestyle habits and genetic backgrounds of twins separated at birth.” Turns out genes played a smaller- than-expected part in the twins’ likelihood of developing cancer, with their inherited DNA contributing only 28 percent of the risk. Dietitian Leslie Beck, author of Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet , agrees: “A long, healthy life requires good habits. Genes play a role, but the rest is up to you.”  What is Katharine’s secret to enjoying a healthy old age? She also attributes her longevity to more than good genes: She’s positive, she has faith in life, people and a higher power, and she constantly seeks out new experiences. Read on for more healthy habits that can help you join the longevity revolution!  1. Never act your age  In Okinawa, Japan, a region with the longest-living people in the world, residents are considered children until they hit 55, and a ritual called kajimaya heralds a return to youth on their 97th birthdays.  In Sardinia, Italy, the traditional greeting, a kent’annos (“May you live to be 100”) is appropriate in a place where age is celebrated and people work into their 90s.  Katharine doesn’t look or act her age. “Mum is definitely young at heart,” says Thomas. “She recently danced at her granddaughter’s wedding and still flies out to visit relatives in Ottawa and Vancouver.” Her adventurous spirit has kept her youthful. Katharine has never stopped searching for new experiences. In her 70s, she toured across Russia, Siberia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. A decade later, she made two treks to China. “Age has never stood in her way,” says her niece Katharine Bergbusch.  2. Shut down stress  Katharine has always embraced a quiet, simple life. “I try not to worry, I just try to live,” she says. “And I try to have enough trust and confidence in myself to deal with things as they come.” Consciously keeping stress at bay is also proven to be key in reducing your risk of chronic inflammation and keeping cortisol levels low (research shows prolonged cortisol spikes may accelerate aging, damaging areas of the brain associated with memory).  The best way to battle stress is to carve out time for the hobbies you enjoy. (Katharine knitted, sewed and made jam into her 90s and still bakes.) It’s also important to find time in your day for quiet reflection. Research shows meditation may increase the activity of enzymes that rebuild telomeres, the sequences of DNA linked to aging that act like the plastic ends of shoelaces — the more they fray, the more you show your age.  3. Eat quality Calorie restriction (CR) — eating 30 percent fewer calories per day without eliminating essential proteins, vitamins and minerals — has the potential to extend life and slow aging. In recent studies of rhesus monkeys, with whom we share 95 percent of our genes, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have followed the primates for over 20 years and found CR delayed the onset of many age-related diseases. Even more compelling: Those who consumed fewer calories were stronger and looked younger than their counterparts on regular diets. Twenty years after the study began, 80 percent of the calorie-restricted monkeys were still alive, compared with 50 percent of the monkeys on normal diets.  In another study comparing the diets of people aged 35 to 82 over a six-year period, those on eat-less plans improved their triglycerides, with 95 percent reporting levels lower than the average North American in her 20s.  Proponents of CR say it isn’t about deprivation: It’s a high-quality, low-calorie diet that might mean cutting 300 to 500 calories (a bag of chips and a soda) out of your day. Meals are planned with long-term nourishment in mind. Think nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits (seven to 10 servings), complex carbs that slowly release energy (unrefined whole grains and legumes) and healthy fats from olive oil and oily fish. “CR can be such a simple change that it looks like little more than a lean health food diet,” says Brian Delaney, co-author of The Longevity Diet .  Beck also notes the connection between calories and long life. “Calorie restriction is believed to extend lifespan in two ways: First, cutting calories reduces the production of free radicals, highly damaging forms of oxygen linked to aging. It also seems to increase the resistance of cells to stress, helping them live longer.”  4. Sleep and have sex “Most North Americans live in sleep deficit,” says Wassef. “If you look at long-lived cultures, you’ll see they get routine, adequate sleep. They prioritize it and they don’t feel guilty about it.” Lack of sleep can offset important hormonal balances and it contributes to weight gain, depression and heart disease.  A little nocturnal action also has lifelong benefits. A study by Duke Medical Center in North Carolina found a woman’s past enjoyment of sex (indicating a history of a healthy, active sex life) was one of the top three most important predictors for increased and enhanced longevity, adding as much as four extra years.  5. Move every day Exercising today offers benefits beyond tomorrow. Yoga, dance, tai chi and other core-building workouts improve balance to help you avoid falls as you age. “Turn your home, community and work into places that present you with natural ways to move,” says Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’ve Lived the Longest . “Focus on activities you love like gardening, walking and playing with your family.”  Research also shows the fountain of youth may flow between the treadmill and dumbbells. “Muscles weaken with age; physical activity helps rejuvenate their stem cells and promote circulation,” says Dafna Benayahu, a medical researcher at Tel Aviv University. “Regular workouts may undo signs of aging elsewhere in the body.” One study found the cells of gym users who clocked 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week looked about 10 years younger than non-exercisers. The best news is, it’s never too late to start. Another study found improved memory skills in women aged 65 to 75 who took up strength training once or twice a week.  6. Connect On Sundays, Katharine’s kitchen is filled with warm smells of foods reflecting her German heritage — roasts, rolanden or schnitzel. “Sunday dinners are a tradition we’re never going to give up,” says Thomas. All the way across the globe, centenarians cherish close ties. In Okinawa, they form part of a person’s ikigai , or reason to live. Elders connect with young people and report some of the lowest depression levels in the world. “Centenarians generally don’t stay isolated,” says Wassef. “Prolonged loneliness can weaken the immune system.” He points to a study involving 7,000 people: Women who felt friendless were five times more likely to die from breast, ovarian and uterine cancers.  7. Tweet about it There’s a growing movement in social networking among the 65-and-older set. Nearly half of all internet users are between the ages of 50 and 64, and social networking among those 50 and older rose from 22 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2010. Googling grandmas report up to a 30-percent decrease in loneliness and symptoms of depression, according to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet stresses the importance of stimulating your mind daily to keep your brain active and improve cognitive skills. On weekday mornings, Katharine does crossword or Sudoku puzzles and catches up on the Winnipeg Free Press to help her stay sharp.  8. Just believe A survey of centenarians found almost a quarter attributed longevity to their faith. Katharine doesn’t fear death, but she also doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. Instead, she finds peace in her belief in a higher power and the goodness of people. Her father was a Lutheran pastor, and she’s always taken an active role in church. According to Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet , when researchers look at the power of religion, they note the important benefits of believing in something outside of yourself. Even if you’re not religious, you can tap into the power of belief, whether it’s getting involved in your community, volunteering for a cause you find important or finding peace outdoors in nature.  Longevity hot spots  Lunenburg and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: One of the highest concentrations of Canadian centenarians lives along these craggy seaside coasts. Experts point to something special in the salty ocean breezes, people’s fish-rich diets and their stress-free community spirit.  Okinawa, Japan: This archipelago’s residents eat three times the vegetables, twice the fruit and 30 percent fewer calories than the average North American. Hara hachi bu (eight parts out of 10) governs each meal, meaning they stop eating when they’re 80 percent satisfied.  Sardinia, Italy: Evening meals are washed down with a glass of red wine squeezed from local grapes loaded with flavonoids, which are believed to reduce heart attack risk by up to 50 percent.  Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: This close-knit community enjoys a high-fibre diet of beans and corn, and dinner is the smallest meal of the day.  Icaria, Greece: Locals take regular midday naps, drink herbal teas every day and love goat’s milk, which has unique fatty acids that may protect against age-related inflammation.  Loma Linda, California: Many residents are practising Seventh-day Adventists, and researchers credit their health to a handful of nuts four to five days a week and alcohol- and nicotine-free lifestyles.  * This article was originally published on March 8, 2013.

Find out the eight secrets to a longer, healthier and fuller life   by Alanna Glassman Updated Sep 22, 2014   8                         Katharine Weber was born the same year a test aircraft, with wings of steel, silk and electrical tape, took off from an ice field in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

In recent studies of rhesus monkeys, with whom we share 95 percent of our genes, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have followed the primates for over 20 years and found CR delayed the onset of many age-related diseases. Even more compelling: Those who consumed fewer calories were stronger and looked younger than their counterparts on regular diets. Twenty years after the study began, 80 percent of the calorie-restricted monkeys were still alive, compared with 50 percent of the monkeys on normal diets.  In another study comparing the diets of people aged 35 to 82 over a six-year period, those on eat-less plans improved their triglycerides, with 95 percent reporting levels lower than the average North American in her 20s.  Proponents of CR say it isn’t about deprivation: It’s a high-quality, low-calorie diet that might mean cutting 300 to 500 calories (a bag of chips and a soda) out of your day. Meals are planned with long-term nourishment in mind. Think nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits (seven to 10 servings), complex carbs that slowly release energy (unrefined whole grains and legumes) and healthy fats from olive oil and oily fish. “CR can be such a simple change that it looks like little more than a lean health food diet,” says Brian Delaney, co-author of The Longevity Diet .  Beck also notes the connection between calories and long life. “Calorie restriction is believed to extend lifespan in two ways: First, cutting calories reduces the production of free radicals, highly damaging forms of oxygen linked to aging. It also seems to increase the resistance of cells to stress, helping them live longer.”  4. Sleep and have sex “Most North Americans live in sleep deficit,” says Wassef. “If you look at long-lived cultures, you’ll see they get routine, adequate sleep. They prioritize it and they don’t feel guilty about it.” Lack of sleep can offset important hormonal balances and it contributes to weight gain, depression and heart disease.  A little nocturnal action also has lifelong benefits. A study by Duke Medical Center in North Carolina found a woman’s past enjoyment of sex (indicating a history of a healthy, active sex life) was one of the top three most important predictors for increased and enhanced longevity, adding as much as four extra years.  5. Move every day Exercising today offers benefits beyond tomorrow. Yoga, dance, tai chi and other core-building workouts improve balance to help you avoid falls as you age. “Turn your home, community and work into places that present you with natural ways to move,” says Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’ve Lived the Longest . “Focus on activities you love like gardening, walking and playing with your family.”  Research also shows the fountain of youth may flow between the treadmill and dumbbells. “Muscles weaken with age; physical activity helps rejuvenate their stem cells and promote circulation,” says Dafna Benayahu, a medical researcher at Tel Aviv University. “Regular workouts may undo signs of aging elsewhere in the body.” One study found the cells of gym users who clocked 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week looked about 10 years younger than non-exercisers. The best news is, it’s never too late to start. Another study found improved memory skills in women aged 65 to 75 who took up strength training once or twice a week.  6. Connect On Sundays, Katharine’s kitchen is filled with warm smells of foods reflecting her German heritage — roasts, rolanden or schnitzel. “Sunday dinners are a tradition we’re never going to give up,” says Thomas. All the way across the globe, centenarians cherish close ties. In Okinawa, they form part of a person’s ikigai , or reason to live. Elders connect with young people and report some of the lowest depression levels in the world. “Centenarians generally don’t stay isolated,” says Wassef. “Prolonged loneliness can weaken the immune system.” He points to a study involving 7,000 people: Women who felt friendless were five times more likely to die from breast, ovarian and uterine cancers.  7. Tweet about it There’s a growing movement in social networking among the 65-and-older set. Nearly half of all internet users are between the ages of 50 and 64, and social networking among those 50 and older rose from 22 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2010. Googling grandmas report up to a 30-percent decrease in loneliness and symptoms of depression, according to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet stresses the importance of stimulating your mind daily to keep your brain active and improve cognitive skills. On weekday mornings, Katharine does crossword or Sudoku puzzles and catches up on the Winnipeg Free Press to help her stay sharp.  8. Just believe A survey of centenarians found almost a quarter attributed longevity to their faith. Katharine doesn’t fear death, but she also doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. Instead, she finds peace in her belief in a higher power and the goodness of people. Her father was a Lutheran pastor, and she’s always taken an active role in church. According to Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet , when researchers look at the power of religion, they note the important benefits of believing in something outside of yourself. Even if you’re not religious, you can tap into the power of belief, whether it’s getting involved in your community, volunteering for a cause you find important or finding peace outdoors in nature.  Longevity hot spots  Lunenburg and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: One of the highest concentrations of Canadian centenarians lives along these craggy seaside coasts. Experts point to something special in the salty ocean breezes, people’s fish-rich diets and their stress-free community spirit.  Okinawa, Japan: This archipelago’s residents eat three times the vegetables, twice the fruit and 30 percent fewer calories than the average North American. Hara hachi bu (eight parts out of 10) governs each meal, meaning they stop eating when they’re 80 percent satisfied.  Sardinia, Italy: Evening meals are washed down with a glass of red wine squeezed from local grapes loaded with flavonoids, which are believed to reduce heart attack risk by up to 50 percent.  Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: This close-knit community enjoys a high-fibre diet of beans and corn, and dinner is the smallest meal of the day.  Icaria, Greece: Locals take regular midday naps, drink herbal teas every day and love goat’s milk, which has unique fatty acids that may protect against age-related inflammation.  Loma Linda, California: Many residents are practising Seventh-day Adventists, and researchers credit their health to a handful of nuts four to five days a week and alcohol- and nicotine-free lifestyles.  * This article was originally published on March 8, 2013.

Will you be among them? You won't know if you're among the genetically predisposed for sure, of course, until those 100 birthday candles are lit. But researchers are discovering more and more clues as to who's on his or her way.  Clue #1: How many elderly relatives are on your family tree?  What it may mean: You may have longevity genes.  At least half of all those who reach 100 have a parent, sibling, or grandparent who has also achieved very old age (90-plus), according to the New England Centenarian Study at the Boston University School of Medicine, which studies 100-plussers to unlock secrets of successful aging.    Advertisement              A 2002 study by the center's director, geriatrician Thomas Perls, found that male siblings of centenarians have a 17 times greater chance of reaching their 100th birthday than other men born around the same time; female siblings are 8.5 times more likely to hit 100 than other females also born around the same time.  Other studies have found that exceptional aging is often clustered among multiple first-tier family members, supporting a genetic link. Having siblings, parents, and grandparents who make it to 100 seems to be a much stronger indicator than counting cousins and other more distant relatives.  Clue #2: How fast and how far can you walk?  What it may mean: You're in good condition for the long haul.  Faster walkers live longer. University of Pittsburgh researchers crunched numbers from nine different studies including almost 35,000 subjects ages 65 or older. The result: For each gait speed increase of 0.1 meters per second came a corresponding 12 percent decrease in the risk of death.    Advertisement         The average speed was 3 feet per second (about two miles an hour). Those who walked slower than 2 feet per second (1.36 miles per hour) had an increased risk of dying. Those who walked faster than 3.3 feet per second (2.25 miles per hour) or faster survived longer than would be predicted simply by age or gender.  A 2006 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that among adults ages 70 to 79, those who couldn't walk a quarter mile were less likely to be alive six years later. They were also more likely to suffer illness and disability before death. An earlier study of men ages 71 to 93 found that those who could walk two miles a day had half the risk of heart attack of those who could walk only a quarter mile or less.  Clue #3: Do you have a lot of people in your life?  What it may mean: Social engagement is a key lifespan-extender.  Countless studies have found that social isolation is bad for your health, while having friends and social engagement is good. One of the more surprising findings in The Longevity Project (a book about an eight-decade study of 1,500 subjects all born around 1910) is that religious women lived longer -- primarily, as it turned out, because of the social connectedness of their faith-based lifestyle. That is, they worshipped with others, joined committees, and engaged in social outreach, from clothing drives to soup kitchens.  "There was a clear, similar trend among people who had civic engagements, were active in their communities, volunteered, and otherwise stayed connected, whether with families, friends, or coworkers," says Leslie R. Martin, a professor of psychology at La Sierra University in Riverside, California, who's the coauthor of The Longevity Project .  More clues that you could live to 100  Clue #4: Are you a woman?  What it may mean: Odds are more in your favor from the start.  Sorry, fellas. In 2010, there were 80,000 centenarians in the U.S.; 85 percent of them were women, and only 15 percent were men.  It's not entirely clear what's causing the disparity. Theories include the protective role of female sex hormones and menstruation, lower rates of cardiovascular disease for women, and higher smoking rates among men. Men also have higher rates of car accidents and suicide.  The survival gap is gradually narrowing, however, possibly because women are living lives that are conventionally male in terms of stress and poorer health habits, especially smoking.  One bit of good news for men: Those who do reach the century mark are, on average, healthier and more functionally fit than their female counterparts. Women survive medical catastrophes better than men but with more disability.  Clue #5 (for women only): Did you have a child after age 35?  What it may mean: This is possible evidence that you're a slow ager.  Popular wisdom holds that late-life babies are tougher on a mother's aging body. If so, that graying hair mixed with newborn pink or blue reflects a silver lining: According to the New England Centenarian Study, a woman who naturally conceives and bears a child after the age of 40 has a four times greater chance of living to 100 than women who don't. Moms who give birth naturally at 35-plus also make it to 100 in larger numbers than younger counterparts.  It's not the act of bearing a child late in life that extends lifespan, however. Researchers instead believe that being able to conceive and give birth in your late 30s or 40s is probably an indicator that your reproductive system is aging slowly -- and that therefore the rest of your body is likely to be aging slowly, as well.  Clue #6: When were you born?  What it may mean: Growing lifespans give younger people an edge.  A 2011 report by the British Department for Work and Pensions estimated life expectancy for citizens at various ages, providing a snapshot that Yanks can learn from, too.  A British girl born this year has a one in three chance of living to 100; a 2011-born boy has a one in four chance. If you're a 20-year-old woman, you have a 26.6 percent chance; a 20-year-old man has a 19.5 percent chance.  The average 50-year-old woman in the U.K. has a 14.6 percent chance of seeing 2061, the year of her diamond-anniversary birthday; just over one in 10 of her male counterparts will still be around then.  And if you're 99 now? You have a whopping 67 percent chance of seeing another year.  Clue #7: Do you worry -- but not too much?  What it may mean: There's a "healthy" worry level.  It sounds like a punch line: "Be afraid, be very afraid -- but not too much!" So-called "catastrophizers" -- Eeyore-like personalities who fret about impending doom, see the glass as half-empty, and are harshly self-critical -- tend to die sooner, according to psychology professor Leslie R. Martin of La Sierra University.  On the other hand, a moderate amount of anxiety and worry is associated with a 50-percent decreased risk of death in any given year, she says. Moderate worriers tend to be less impulsive, take fewer risks, have less risky hobbies, and plan for alternatives, which may all be protective without adding a negative health impact.  More clues that you could live to 100  Clue #8: Is your weight normal -- or are you only slightly overweight?  What it may mean: You have better odds of reaching 100 than if you were obese.  A surprising 2011 Albert Einstein College of Medicine study of 477 adults ages 95 to 112 found that these solid-gold agers had no better health habits overall than a comparison group born at the same time that had been studied in the 1970s. One difference: Those in long-lived group were much less likely to be obese.  Both male and female centenarians in the study were overweight at about the same rates as those in the shorter-lived group. But only 4.5 percent of the long-lived men and 9.6 of the women were obese, compared to 12.1 percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, of the younger-lived controls. ("Normal weight" is a Body Mass Index -- or BMI, a measure of height in proportion to weight -- in the range of 18 to 24; "overweight" is 25 to 30; over 30 is "obese.")  This finding echoes other studies showing the greatest risks of death among those who are obese or underweight at age 65 (BMI under 18.5), compared to those of normal weight or slight overweight. A 2011 study at Loma Linda University in Southern California found that men over age 75 with a BMI over 27.4 lived nearly four years less than those with a lower BMI. For women over age 75, a BMI over 27.4 led to a two-year shorter lifespan. Studies of centenarians show that men who reach 100 are almost always lean (more so than women).  Luckily, this clue is one you can control. "Since you can't be sure if you'll live to 100, I wouldn't take the chance of ignoring the lifestyle interventions that we know will at least put you in the half the population who die after age 80 -- starting with watching weight and being sure to exercise," says the senior author of the Albert Einstein study, Nir Barzilai, director of the college's Institute for Aging Research.  Clue # 9: How long are your telomeres?  What it may mean: Many people who live to 100 have a hyperactive version of an enzyme that rebuilds telomeres.  "What-o-meres?" you ask. Telomeres are protective DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes that gradually shorten as cells divide. (Pioneering telomere researcher Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California-San Francisco compares them to shoelace caps.) Eventually the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing, a condition called senescence, creating the effects we recognize as aging in related tissue.  Scientists are still unraveling the key role telomeres seem to play in aging, cancer, and other biological processes, but this much is clear: The longer your telomeres, the more time you're apt to have left. A 2010 Italian study reported that cancer-free people with shorter telomeres were more likely to develop cancer within ten years than those with longer telomeres, for example.  Some studies show that removing chronic stress, not smoking, and eating a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can improve telomere length. Those centenarians with hyperactive telomere-making apparatus can probably thank their genes, though.  New blood tests are now being marketed directly to consumers, purporting to predict longevity based on telomere length. But critics caution that there aren't standards for measuring telomere length and that there can be such variability in telomeres that it's hard to predict much of anything from a sample.  Clue #10: Are you a positive person?  What it may mean: Emotion influences health, which influences aging.  Some studies have shown that an upbeat attitude about aging adds years. But long-term studies conducted at the Stanford Longevity Center show that emotions, more than attitudes, may be the biologic mechanism at work, says Laura Carstensen, the center's director.  "What's the mechanism at work here? Feeling upbeat about your life means you experience less stress, which in turn affects cortisol levels, which can affect health," she says. Stanford researchers periodically assess 19 different emotions in subjects randomly polled over 1 week at 5-year intervals. Having more positive emotions than negative ones is associated with living longer.  Carstensen is a firm believer that while "slow agers" clearly exist, there's more to their stories than lucky genes. "There's mounting evidence that genes play a role in longevity, but genes play a role in almost everything," she says. "They don't express themselves in vacuums -- there are very complex interactions between genes and lifestyle." So all that advice on how to live to 100 ? Can't hurt to heed it.

Do old people with more muscle than other people their age live longer?         about 3 years,  Ric's wife  said...     We live, I am sad to say, in a society where things often get 'thrown away'..even older people..long before the time is due. I see elderly neighbors, and it is obvious to me that NO ONE is looking in on them, stopping by, calling..they are neglected. Period. On the other hand...I discovered as my friend Joe started to really decline that the law states, "an elderly person has the right to refuse help - even if that refusal hastens his or her demise." (!!) A perfectly idiotic law. And Alz is making that a game changer. Because, your 'independent family member/neighbor' might be leaving a pot on the stove and causing a fire, thus the local Engine company must come and douse it..is endangering the entire building. And a good neighbor of ours was removed to a nursing home after the third fire, by order of the management Board. Truly, as I observe my elderly colleagues and family members I know each is unique, and although the factors in play for every person are different, some have one person in the family circle shouldering everything. Some have a circle of involved people. But support groups are there, and a friend found a church group that began to help out, along with referrals to home aides and eventually, assisted care. It is truly exhausting and depressing to come home after a day of paying bills, cleaning up, and going head to head with someone who outright balks at your kind help. And often by the time the person needs it, it is too late for them to even understand and reflect that they DO. Take care of yourself as you struggle and deal with a situation like this. Reach out for help. And while we're about it... put your dimwit, selfish family members on notice, those who 'keep meaning to go and see Aunt Hepzibah/Dad/Grandmom', to get off their butts and help!. I see inequities like this every day; and am not the least bit shy about speaking up. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, and no way should one person carry the load for all, especially when caring for an elderly loved one with serious dementia, and related medical challenges. The unintended consequence of living longer can sometimes be dementia. Not all people remain active, engaged and clearheaded, dear Lord - would that it could be so. Bless the folks who are fortunate enough to mountain climb, and do it all..right up to the very end.. And bless those who are not so lucky, and lastly, those steadfast folks who must care for them!         about 3 years,  popsie  said...     Great article.

Thank you,         almost 5 years, a fellow commenter  said...     I only want to live until my usefulness is gone....be it 75 or 100 . After that, let me go or give me something to do do even if it's shelling peas or licking stamps.  A doctor once said: "The secret to a long, HAPPY life is to get up every day with something to do." We cannot control things like dementia or disease, to a large degree, but have the kindness to find a caring place to take care care of your loved one so you can visit often but have a life of your own. There are many caring places, I have worked in one and know of others - just do your research and your part to oversee their care if you can't.  My mother-in-law lived to be 100 in her own home with round the clocks sitters like the Queen of England and was robbed of her valuables and self respect - all because her two sons could not do the right thing and put her in a nice place nearby.  I do not want to live to be 100 like this.  Who does?  Life is not meant to be extended by a number, but by dignity.  Once that is gone, you might as well be dead. No more articles about living to be 100!         almost 5 years,  YaYaBaby  said...     Your great...no complaints here. Keep up the good work & educating us!         almost 5 years,  sami_  said...     not thanks         over 5 years,  zambezi  said...     Ric's wife is helping people who help to whatever extent they can when they are needed. Imagine every day that you woke up with a depressed person who would not do anything to help yourself and actively resisted living with you because she wanted to be in her own home. She doesn't help. She doesn't go anywhere, she doesn't like anything and she hates me. I have enough grief to carry with my daughter's pulmonary embolism at age 36, my son's terminal illness, my husband's kidney transplant that is rejecting and my father's death from prostate cancer and my mother's death from breast cancer. I do not have the emotional resilience to carry someone else's grief and sour puss every moment of the day. Nor will my mother-in-law consider going to counseling to pop her giant zit of misery. My simple message is this: I cannot continue to do it all for everyone. I am caving in myself. And the only way my mother-in-law has made it to 97 is because I have done all the care, cooking, cleaning, working to supplement our depleted savings, washing her clothes, changing her diapers and getting nothing in return but a kick when her son, my husband, is out of the room and then she tells me I hit her. His undivided loyalty needs to be with me. And I simply can't do this any more. My neighbors have moved out. My children live 20 hours away by car. There is NO backup. My husband WON'T pay for respite care. I cannot leave her on the floor if she falls at night. I don't know how to make it any clearer. Is she "living to 100?" Yes, she will. Will I? No, I won't. Again, one of the indicators of longevity is the support system that takes the stress so the elderly patient can survive.         over 5 years,  zambezi  said...     To Caring Community and the authors who wrote this initial article:
When you wrote about the factors that enable people to reach 100, you forgot to include that most of that goes to being cared for by caregivers who lose out on their own longevity to provide care under stress. That's how I got into answering here instead of at resource articles. Your article needed some indication of ongoing support. Centenarians do not take care of themselves.         over 5 years,  Ric's wife  said...     Well, one thing is certainly true: age, and just plain living, brings us through may experiences. We all face challenges: poverty, illness, loneliness, the steady erosion of independence - I see this daily, when I visit my seniors. Each has a story to tell, and each has weathered some appalling personal crisis. The death of a loved partner, reduced financial circumstances, growing frailty. These are indeed realities of being elderly in our society. So, I don't know what to say about the 'bad part of getting older'.. pessimism about one's state, and future may in some cases be justified. But for my people, all of whom have multiple reasons to feel lousy the moment they get out of bed in the morning - they actually don't choose to DO that. They are involved in life, and I let them natter away at me, while I prepare coffee, mop, clean out their fridge, help them with the grocery list. And I suspect that that may be a clue to Mary (90) Joe (89) and my Mom, Lucille (90) still chugging along, and showing no signs of slowing down. I am, as some know, just a 'whippersnapper' of 64 myself, but when we had the fire at our building, these so called 'doddery' oldsters were calling up, taking time, comforting ME!! Their reassurance, wisdom and perspective (one senior neighbor of mine remembers the Holocaust) kept me from losing my mind. Do they sometimes feel angry, or put-upon? Sure enough. But they're still alive and, facing things head-on. Another clue? While I truly savor my moments of repose and calm, I am no fool to think they can last 24/7. I take my older friends 'vinegar in the greens' points of view as something that frequently comes in quite handy in the real world. And that 'tude may also prolong life.         over 5 years,  Caring Community  said...     Hello All, Thank you for your comments.

To all those hoping to live to be 100, be very, very careful what you wish for because it might come true and you might not like what it brings.         over 5 years,  Ric's wife  said...     For further hints I suggest reading LOST HORIZON, by James Hilton, and Conway's conversation with the High Lama, who is well past the age of 100. Moderation in all things, a philosophy of work balanced with spirituality. Not always possible in our high tech world, I grant you - but there are may leaves from the Lama's worldview that can work for us, and give us a very wise perspective on ways to navigate through life's troubles, and challenges. Of course in the case of Shangri La, these people live away from all the hurly burly, but I often open the book, and gain insights from the way they view and approach the stresses of life. And, of and by itself it's also a wonderful read, even though it was written in the 1930's just as the WW2 Axis wheels were cranking in gear. Hilton's book nevertheless contains timeless, heartwarming insights that touch... and can teach us all a thing or two!         over 5 years,  zambezi  said...     One last observation about my own comments. I was initially trying to warn caregivers to set up backup before they get stuck with all of the responsibilities, sharing with siblings or adult children or respite care. But I got into the abyss of venting because I am literally moving out in a week or so and nobody, especially an overburdened caregiver like you or anyone else, needs to hear bad news when they are seeking hope.

Will You Live To Be 100?  Life expectancy is up as people are living longer than ever before, thanks to a number of factors including improvements in health science and technology. However, living to the age of 100 remains a remarkable and somewhat rare feat. Individuals aged 100 or older, referred to as centenarians, make up less than one percent of the U.S. population. What are the odds that you’ll live to age 100?  What Centenarians and Life Expectancy Tell Us Today  According to the U.S. Census Special Report on Centenarians, in 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the United States or 1.73 per 10,000 people in the total population. The Centenarian Special Report also shed light on a few interesting facts about centenarians alive today:    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT        Geography Matters  To start with, the United States falls behind other developed countries in terms of the proportion of centenarians to the total population:      Country Centenarian Share of the Total Population      Japan 3.43 per 10,000    France 2.70 per 10,000    United Kingdom 1.95 per 10,000    Sweden 1.92 per 10,000    United States 1.73 per 10,000      Moreover, there are regional differences within the United States. Centenarians comprise a higher proportion of the total regional population in the Midwest and Northeast and a lower share in South and the West.  The Odds Dramatically Higher for Women Than Men  While life expectancy has risen overall, women continue to live longer than men, a trend that is reinforced in current data on centenarians. Women make up 82.8% of individuals age 100 years and older while men make up just 17.2%.  The Odds of Living to 100 Change Over Time, Generational Cohort  Overall, the trend for life expectancy is one of increase. Since 1970, life expectancy in the U.S. has risen by nearly a decade, from 70.8 years to 79 years today. Additionally, in 2011 in the United Kingdom (where life expectancy is 81 years old, roughly two years higher than in United States), the Department for Work and Pensions released a report listing the chances of living to age 100 by year of birth:   Search by Year of Birth     Year of Birth Male Female Both Sexes      1912 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1913 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1914 0.30% 1.20% 0.70%    1915 0.30% 1.20% 0.80%    1916 0.40% 1.30% 0.80%    1917 0.40% 1.40% 0.90%    1918 0.50% 1.60% 1.10%    1919 0.70% 1.90% 1.30%    1920 0.60% 1.80% 1.20%    1921 0.70% 2.10% 1.40%    1922 0.80% 2.30% 1.60%    1923 1.00% 2.50% 1.70%    1924 1.10% 2.70% 1.90%    1925 1.20% 3.00% 2.10%    1926 1.40% 3.20% 2.30%    1927 1.60% 3.50% 2.50%    1928 1.70% 3.80% 2.80%    1929 2.00% 4.20% 3.10%    1930 2.30% 4.60% 3.40%    1931 2.50% 5.10% 3.80%    1932 2.90% 5.60% 4.20%    1933 3.20% 6.20% 4.70%    1934 3.60% 6.80% 5.20%    1935 4.00% 7.30% 5.60%    1936 4.30% 7.90% 6.10%    1937 4.60% 8.40% 6.50%    1938 5.00% 8.90% 6.90%    1939 5.20% 9.30% 7.20%    1940 5.40% 9.60% 7.50%    1941 5.70% 9.90% 7.80%    1942 6.00% 10.30% 8.10%    1943 6.20% 10.60% 8.40%    1944 6.40% 10.90% 8.60%    1945 6.60% 11.10% 8.90%    1946 6.90% 11.50% 9.20%    1947 7.10% 11.80% 9.50%    1948 7.40% 12.20% 9.80%    1949 7.70% 12.50% 10.10%    1950 7.90% 12.80% 10.40%    1951 8.20% 13.10% 10.60%    1952 8.40% 13.50% 10.90%    1953 8.60% 13.70% 11.20%    1954 8.80% 14.00% 11.40%    1955 9.10% 14.40% 11.70%    1956 9.30% 14.70% 12.00%    1957 9.50% 14.90% 12.20%    1958 9.80% 15.20% 12.50%    1959 10.00% 15.60% 12.80%    1960 10.20% 15.90% 13.10%    1961 10.50% 16.20% 13.30%    1962 10.70% 16.50% 13.60%    1963 11.00% 16.80% 13.90%    1964 11.20% 17.10% 14.20%    1965 11.50% 17.40% 14.50%    1966 11.80% 17.70% 14.70%    1967 12.00% 18.10% 15.00%    1968 12.30% 18.40% 15.30%    1969 12.50% 18.70% 15.60%    1970 12.80% 19.00% 15.90%    1971 13.10% 19.40% 16.20%    1972 13.30% 19.70% 16.50%    1973 13.60% 20.00% 16.80%    1974 13.90% 20.40% 17.10%    1975 14.20% 20.70% 17.40%    1976 14.50% 21.10% 17.80%    1977 14.80% 21.40% 18.10%    1978 15.10% 21.70% 18.40%    1979 15.40% 22.10% 18.70%    1980 15.70% 22.40% 19.10%    1981 16.00% 22.80% 19.40%    1982 16.30% 23.10% 19.70%    1983 16.60% 23.50% 20.10%    1984 17.00% 23.80% 20.40%    1985 17.30% 24.20% 20.70%    1986 17.60% 24.50% 21.10%    1987 17.90% 24.90% 21.40%    1988 18.20% 25.30% 21.70%    1989 18.50% 25.60% 22.10%    1990 18.90% 26.00% 22.40%    1991 19.20% 26.40% 22.80%    1992 19.50% 26.70% 23.10%    1993 19.90% 27.10% 23.50%    1994 20.20% 27.50% 23.80%    1995 20.50% 27.80% 24.20%    1996 20.90% 28.20% 24.50%    1997 21.20% 28.50% 24.90%    1998 21.50% 28.90% 25.20%    1999 21.90% 29.30% 25.60%    2000 22.20% 29.60% 25.90%    2001 22.60% 30.00% 26.30%    2002 22.90% 30.40% 26.60%    2003 23.20% 30.70% 27.00%    2004 23.60% 31.10% 27.30%    2005 23.90% 31.50% 27.70%    2006 24.30% 31.80% 28.10%    2007 24.60% 32.20% 28.40%    2008 25.00% 32.60% 28.80%    2009 25.30% 32.90% 29.10%    2010 25.70% 33.30% 29.50%    2011 26.00% 33.70% 29.90%      Our odds of living to 100 are dramatically better than those of our grandparents, and babies born today have it even better.

The answer may be in your genes.                  By Marlene Cimons   By Marlene Cimons   December 14, 2015     Mary Harada’s father lived to 102, healthy and sharp to the end. She wouldn’t mind living that long, if she could stay as mentally and physically fit as he was. “He died sitting in his chair,’’ says Harada, 80, a retired history professor who lives in West Newbury, Mass. “He was in excellent shape until his heart stopped.’’  She may, in fact, have a good chance of getting there. Longevity experts believe that extreme old age — 100 or older — runs in families, and often is strikingly apparent in families where there are several siblings or other close relatives who have reached that milestone. (Harada’s great-aunt — her father’s aunt — also lived an extremely long life, to 104.)  Moreover, researchers are finding that many of those who live to extreme old age remain in remarkably good condition, delaying the onset of such chronic and debilitating age-related illnesses as cancer, heart disease and diabetes until close to the end of their lives, and a certain percentage don’t get them at all.   [ Tech Titan’s Latest Project: Defying Death ]   “It’s one thing to live to be 100 and quite another to live to be 100 and be in good shape,’’ says Winifred K. Rossi, deputy director of the Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology at the National Institute on Aging. The institute is sponsoring an ongoing study of more than 500 families with long-lived members that involves nearly 5,000 individuals. “Something is going on that has protected them from the bad stuff that causes problems for other people earlier in life.’’    ( Martin Tognola for The Washington Post)   Experts attribute healthy longevity to a combination of good genes and good behaviors. Good behaviors play a greater role than genes in getting you to your mid-to-late 80s — don’t smoke or drink alcohol, exercise regularly and eat healthfully — while getting beyond 90, and to 100 or even older, probably depends more heavily on genes, they say. Families with a cluster of members with exceptional longevity don’t occur by chance, they say, but probably from familial factors they all share.  Growing numbers  Centenarians have become a fast-growing group in this country. In 1980, there were 32,194 Americans age 100 or older. By 2010, the number had grown to 53,364, or 1.73 centenarians per 10,000 people, according to the Census Bureau . This represents a 65.8 percent increase during that period, compared with a 36.3 percent rise in the general population.  Moreover, the number of Americans 90 and older nearly tripled during the past three decades, reaching 1.9 million in 2010, and is expected to more than quadruple between 2010 and 2050, according to the bureau. Globally, the number of centenarians is expected to increase tenfold during that time, according to the aging institute.  This is probably due to numerous factors, among them improved health care, dietary changes and reduced rates of smoking.  “When I started practicing, it was rare to see someone of 100, but now it’s not that strange at all,’’ says Anne B. Newman, director of the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Pittsburgh. “More people have had the opportunity to get there,’’ largely because of advances in public health and medicine.  But as the numbers of very old have increased and the examination of human genetics has become more sophisticated, researchers have been trying to discover the genetic and biological factors that contribute to a life span of 100 or older and why some centenarians stay healthy for so long. Not surprisingly, what they are finding is complicated and far from a one-size-fits-all answer.  “Aging is not simple,’’ says Thomas Perls, a professor of medicine at Boston University and director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston Medical Center. “There are many different biological mechanisms involved in aging, so it makes sense that there are different genes involved. We are still in the infancy of figuring this out.’’      The average American can expect to live for about 80 years. But that may change as scientists develop new ways to prolong human life.

But that may change as scientists develop new ways to prolong human life. In this game, you will have access to seven promising tools. Play to learn more. Can you make it to 100 years or beyond?   Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, has been conducting several studies that focus on inherited genetic and biological influences that promote longevity.  In 2003, for example, his team discovered that centenarians, especially women, and their offspring have significantly higher HDL, or good cholesterol, which protects against heart disease, hypertension and metabolic syndrome , a series of risk factors that raise the chances of heart disease, diabetes and stroke.  The results , which found HDL levels of 60 and higher within this group — anything lower than 50 raises the risk of heart disease — suggest a heritable trait “that promotes healthy aging,’’ he says. This isn’t surprising, considering that women outlive men overall and — in 2010 — nearly 83 percent of centenarians were female, according to the Census Bureau.  Unusual chemistry  The Einstein researchers also have found that centenarians and their offspring often make unusually large amounts of a peptide (a short chain of amino acids) called humanin, which declines with age in most people and whose loss contributes to the development of Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. This may help explain why those who produce higher levels of humanin enjoy greater protection against those diseases and experience exceptionally long lives. For these individuals, humanin diminishes as they age, too, but the levels are much higher to start with than those of average people.  Barzilai believes the propensity for high levels of both HDL and humanin is heritable: “Offspring of centenarians have higher levels of humanin than their parents. Same with HDL. It declines with age, so it’s more apparent in the offspring.’’  Perls and his colleagues, in a study released almost four years ago, concluded there is no single common gene variant responsible for exceptional longevity. Rather, after examining about 280 gene variations, they discovered a series of gene combinations — nearly two dozen, in fact — that they believe contribute to long lives, “meaning there are different ways to get to these old ages,’’ Perls says. “It’s like playing the lottery. If you get all seven numbers, you’ll hit the jackpot.’’  These genetic groupings also seem to be involved in protecting against developing age-related diseases, since the scientists did not find an absence of disease-causing genes in their study group. “They have just as many as everybody else, which was a big surprise to us,’’ Perls says.  Also, the researchers found that the children of these healthy centenarians stay healthy longer than their same-age counterparts. The offspring of centenarians show 60 percent less heart disease, stroke, diabetes and hypertension, and 80 percent fewer overall deaths when they are in their early 70s, than those who were born at the same time but who do not have longevity in their families.  “They remain incredibly healthy into their 70s and 80s, and their mortality rate is very low, compared to others born at the same time,’’ Perls says.  Perls has studied 2,300 centenarians since 1995, including “super-centenarians’’ of 110 or older, and their offspring. He says about 45 percent of those who reach 100 manage to delay chronic age-related diseases until after they turn 80, and about 15 percent never get them at all.  Furthermore, he found that “semi-super-centenarians’’ — that is, those who are 105 to 109 — and super-centenarians don’t develop those diseases until roughly the final 5 percent of their very long lives. “They are dealing with diseases much better than the average person,’’ he says, who is more likely to develop these diseases in the 60s and 70s.  Many eventually die from the same diseases as non-centenarians, “but they do it 30 years later,’’ Barzilai says.  ‘An additional 10 years’  Perls says that if you want to know whether you will live to 100, “you don’t have to do all this complicated genetic testing. Just look at your family and your health-related behaviors.’’ If you engage in healthful practices, you could reach your late 80s. “If you have the genes for longevity and you fight them [with risky behaviors], you will chop time off,’’ he says. “But if there is longevity in your family and you don’t do those things, you might get an additional 10 years past 90.’’  Newman agrees. “Don’t underestimate how powerful lifestyle is in longevity,’’ she says. “Even if longevity runs in your family, your life expectancy still will be more influenced by how you take care of yourself. If you have a centenarian parent, don’t count on living to 100 if you smoke, drink, eat a high-fat diet, and are sedentary and sleep-deprived.’’  Mary Harada thinks less about her genes and more about the unexpected event — breaking a bone, for example — that could make her a burden to her adult children.  “I don’t spend much time thinking about how long I’m going to live,’’ she says. “Whatever happens, happens. I spend more time thinking about how long I’m going to stay in my current house.’’  She has no age-related diseases and always has taken good care of herself. She has been a runner for 47 years, and she lifts weights. She shuns smoking and avoids most processed foods. She lives alone — her husband died last year — and she does most of the maintenance in and around her four-bedroom house, including leaf removal, routine yard work and spending two hours every 10 days in spring and summer mowing a very hilly lawn.  “I’ve lived here for 40 years, and I like living in this house and in this town,’’ she says. “If I could be like my father, and not break anything, I would stay here another five to 10 years. That would be wonderful.’’   Cimons — whose mother lived to be 100 — writes frequently about health issues for The Post.

Through the power of actuarial estimates, it is possible to figure out approximately how long you are likely to live. We made a set of charts, based on data from the Social Security Administration's cohort life tables , that show, given your gender and current age, the probability that you will reach some particular later age. Naturally, these are based on averages for a particular age group — health conditions and lifestyle choices like diet, exercise, and smoking can vastly alter one's life expectancy. Regardless, this is important information for anyone who has to think about things like retirement and estate planning. Here are the charts, in descending order by present age: If you are an 80 year old man, your long-term odds are not great. There is a 30% chance of making it to your 90th birthday, and only about 14 in 1,000 will see 100. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration 70 year olds have a somewhat better prognosis. Almost 2/3 of 70 year old men and almost 3/4 of 70 year old women will live at least another ten years, and over 1/5 of men will make it to 90, as will 1/3 of women. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For 60 year olds, we see some of the benefits of modern medicine kicking in. The overwhelming majority of 60 year olds will live until at least 70, and majorities will get to at least 80. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Similarly, very few people who make it to 50 die before they turn 60. As we look at younger and younger cohorts, we see better and better long-term odds as well. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For people turning 40, comfortable majorities will see 80, and one in twenty women who are currently 40 will be able to blow out 100 birthday candles someday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Dying in your thirties is an extremely old-fashioned idea. Only 1.5% of thirty year old men, and just 0.9% of thirty year old women will die before their fortieth birthday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration The late 21st century will have more than its fair share of elderly millenials. 60% of twenty year old men and 70% of twenty year old women will live to see the year 2074. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration One interesting aspect of this data is that the Social Security administration projects that the gap in longevity between men and women will continue into the future. Even among today's ten year olds, girls are likely to outlive boys. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Finally, children born today will live longer than any other generation. About 2/3 will live past 80, and 1/3 past 90. Almost one in ten girls born now will live past 100.

Herman/For The Daily It                                                     Life expectancy is up as people are living longer than ever before, thanks to a number of factors including improvements in health science and technology. However, living to the age of 100 remains a remarkable and somewhat rare feat. Individuals aged 100 or older, referred to as centenarians, make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. What are the odds that you’ll live to age 100? According to the U.S. Census Special Report on Centenarians, in 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the United States or 1.73 per 10,000 people in the total population. The Centenarian Special Report also shed light on a few interesting facts about centenarians alive today: 1) Geography matters To start with, the United States falls behind other developed countries in terms of the proportion of centenarians to the total population. Japan has the highest number of centenarians, with 3.43 per 10,000 citizens, followed by France, United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United States, with 1.73 per 10,000 citizens. Moreover, there are regional differences within the United States. Centenarians comprise a higher proportion of the total regional population in the Midwest and Northeast and a lower share in South and the West. 2) Odds dramatically higher for women than men While life expectancy has risen overall, women continue to live longer than men, a trend that is reinforced in current data on centenarians. Women make up 82.8 percent of individuals age 100 years and older while men make up just 17.2 percent.  3) Odds of living to 100 change over time Overall, the trend for life expectancy is one of increase. Since 1970, life expectancy in the U.S. has risen by nearly a decade, from 70.8 years to 79 years today. Additionally, in 2011 in the United Kingdom (where life expectancy is 81 years old, roughly two years higher than in United States), the Department for Work and Pensions released a report listing the chances of living to age 100 by year of birth. To see the listing, go to http://discovertheodds.com/what-are-the-odds-of-living-to-100 .       It’s pretty safe to say that your odds of living to 100 are dramatically better than those of your grandparents, and babies born today have an even better chance of becoming centenarians. — Source: http://discovertheodds.com/what-are-the-odds-of-living-to-100/                       This Week's Circulars                                                            ADVERTISERS        This Week's Circulars                   Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter                                                                                 First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Will You Live To Be 100?  Life expectancy is up as people are living longer than ever before, thanks to a number of factors including improvements in health science and technology. However, living to the age of 100 remains a remarkable and somewhat rare feat. Individuals aged 100 or older, referred to as centenarians, make up less than one percent of the U.S. population. What are the odds that you’ll live to age 100?  What Centenarians and Life Expectancy Tell Us Today  According to the U.S. Census Special Report on Centenarians, in 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the United States or 1.73 per 10,000 people in the total population. The Centenarian Special Report also shed light on a few interesting facts about centenarians alive today:    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT        Geography Matters  To start with, the United States falls behind other developed countries in terms of the proportion of centenarians to the total population:      Country Centenarian Share of the Total Population      Japan 3.43 per 10,000    France 2.70 per 10,000    United Kingdom 1.95 per 10,000    Sweden 1.92 per 10,000    United States 1.73 per 10,000      Moreover, there are regional differences within the United States. Centenarians comprise a higher proportion of the total regional population in the Midwest and Northeast and a lower share in South and the West.  The Odds Dramatically Higher for Women Than Men  While life expectancy has risen overall, women continue to live longer than men, a trend that is reinforced in current data on centenarians. Women make up 82.8% of individuals age 100 years and older while men make up just 17.2%.  The Odds of Living to 100 Change Over Time, Generational Cohort  Overall, the trend for life expectancy is one of increase. Since 1970, life expectancy in the U.S. has risen by nearly a decade, from 70.8 years to 79 years today. Additionally, in 2011 in the United Kingdom (where life expectancy is 81 years old, roughly two years higher than in United States), the Department for Work and Pensions released a report listing the chances of living to age 100 by year of birth:   Search by Year of Birth     Year of Birth Male Female Both Sexes      1912 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1913 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1914 0.30% 1.20% 0.70%    1915 0.30% 1.20% 0.80%    1916 0.40% 1.30% 0.80%    1917 0.40% 1.40% 0.90%    1918 0.50% 1.60% 1.10%    1919 0.70% 1.90% 1.30%    1920 0.60% 1.80% 1.20%    1921 0.70% 2.10% 1.40%    1922 0.80% 2.30% 1.60%    1923 1.00% 2.50% 1.70%    1924 1.10% 2.70% 1.90%    1925 1.20% 3.00% 2.10%    1926 1.40% 3.20% 2.30%    1927 1.60% 3.50% 2.50%    1928 1.70% 3.80% 2.80%    1929 2.00% 4.20% 3.10%    1930 2.30% 4.60% 3.40%    1931 2.50% 5.10% 3.80%    1932 2.90% 5.60% 4.20%    1933 3.20% 6.20% 4.70%    1934 3.60% 6.80% 5.20%    1935 4.00% 7.30% 5.60%    1936 4.30% 7.90% 6.10%    1937 4.60% 8.40% 6.50%    1938 5.00% 8.90% 6.90%    1939 5.20% 9.30% 7.20%    1940 5.40% 9.60% 7.50%    1941 5.70% 9.90% 7.80%    1942 6.00% 10.30% 8.10%    1943 6.20% 10.60% 8.40%    1944 6.40% 10.90% 8.60%    1945 6.60% 11.10% 8.90%    1946 6.90% 11.50% 9.20%    1947 7.10% 11.80% 9.50%    1948 7.40% 12.20% 9.80%    1949 7.70% 12.50% 10.10%    1950 7.90% 12.80% 10.40%    1951 8.20% 13.10% 10.60%    1952 8.40% 13.50% 10.90%    1953 8.60% 13.70% 11.20%    1954 8.80% 14.00% 11.40%    1955 9.10% 14.40% 11.70%    1956 9.30% 14.70% 12.00%    1957 9.50% 14.90% 12.20%    1958 9.80% 15.20% 12.50%    1959 10.00% 15.60% 12.80%    1960 10.20% 15.90% 13.10%    1961 10.50% 16.20% 13.30%    1962 10.70% 16.50% 13.60%    1963 11.00% 16.80% 13.90%    1964 11.20% 17.10% 14.20%    1965 11.50% 17.40% 14.50%    1966 11.80% 17.70% 14.70%    1967 12.00% 18.10% 15.00%    1968 12.30% 18.40% 15.30%    1969 12.50% 18.70% 15.60%    1970 12.80% 19.00% 15.90%    1971 13.10% 19.40% 16.20%    1972 13.30% 19.70% 16.50%    1973 13.60% 20.00% 16.80%    1974 13.90% 20.40% 17.10%    1975 14.20% 20.70% 17.40%    1976 14.50% 21.10% 17.80%    1977 14.80% 21.40% 18.10%    1978 15.10% 21.70% 18.40%    1979 15.40% 22.10% 18.70%    1980 15.70% 22.40% 19.10%    1981 16.00% 22.80% 19.40%    1982 16.30% 23.10% 19.70%    1983 16.60% 23.50% 20.10%    1984 17.00% 23.80% 20.40%    1985 17.30% 24.20% 20.70%    1986 17.60% 24.50% 21.10%    1987 17.90% 24.90% 21.40%    1988 18.20% 25.30% 21.70%    1989 18.50% 25.60% 22.10%    1990 18.90% 26.00% 22.40%    1991 19.20% 26.40% 22.80%    1992 19.50% 26.70% 23.10%    1993 19.90% 27.10% 23.50%    1994 20.20% 27.50% 23.80%    1995 20.50% 27.80% 24.20%    1996 20.90% 28.20% 24.50%    1997 21.20% 28.50% 24.90%    1998 21.50% 28.90% 25.20%    1999 21.90% 29.30% 25.60%    2000 22.20% 29.60% 25.90%    2001 22.60% 30.00% 26.30%    2002 22.90% 30.40% 26.60%    2003 23.20% 30.70% 27.00%    2004 23.60% 31.10% 27.30%    2005 23.90% 31.50% 27.70%    2006 24.30% 31.80% 28.10%    2007 24.60% 32.20% 28.40%    2008 25.00% 32.60% 28.80%    2009 25.30% 32.90% 29.10%    2010 25.70% 33.30% 29.50%    2011 26.00% 33.70% 29.90%      Our odds of living to 100 are dramatically better than those of our grandparents, and babies born today have it even better.

Jun 23, 2015      More than three out of five 65-year-olds today will reach age 80.    Rising life expectancy and potentially exorbitant long-term care costs have increased the financial resources required to support oneself and one’s spouse in retirement and old age.  Americans today are living longer than did previous generations, thanks to advances in medicine and changes in lifestyle. As shown in the dark green bars, 50 years ago a man who had reached 65 had an 81 percent chance of reaching 70, a 41 percent chance of hitting 80, and a 10 percent chance of turning 90. By comparison, the chances of reaching those same ages for a man who reaches 65 in 2015 are (as shown in the light green bars) 90 percent, 62 percent, and 22 percent, respectively. Put differently, the likelihood of a 65-year-old man seeing his 80th birthday has increased by 50 percent, and the likelihood of him seeing his 90th birthday has more than doubled. Women live longer than men on average, and they have experienced smaller but still substantial gains in life expectancy over the past 50 years.

years ago I went into the studio and recorded a 56-minute video for
teenagers called "Three Keys To Greatness." Although my focus was for
teenagers, the principles I shared certainly apply to adults as well.  Recently I was asked to list these three things using one to two sentences for each.  Now for your benefit here they are again.  1) Setting Goals. I call it the view of the future. Most people, including kids, will pay
the price if they can see the promise of the future. So we need to help
our kids see a well-defined future, so they will be motivated to pay
the price today to attain the rewards of tomorrow. Goals help them do
this.  2) Personal Development. Simply making consistent investments in our self-education and
knowledge banks pays major dividends throughout our lives. I suggest
having a minimum amount of time set aside for reading books, listening
to audiocassettes, attending seminars, keeping a journal and spending
time with other successful people. Charlie Tremendous Jones says you
will be in five years the sum total of the books you read and the
people you are around.  3) Financial Planning. I call it the 70/30 plan. After receiving your paycheck or paying
yourself, simply setting aside 10% for saving, 10% for investing and
10% for giving, and over time this will guarantee financial
independence for a teenager.  If
a young person, or for that matter an adult, focused on doing these
three simple things over a long period of time I believe they will be
assured success!  To Your Success, Jim Rohn          Brought to you by:     Jeffrey N.

A picture taken on July 22, 2013, shows an old women walking in a corridor of the Ehpad retirement home "Maison d'Aquitaine" in Merignac, southwestern France, during a visit of French Junior Minister for the Elderly.     AFP PHOTO / NICOLAS TUCAT        (Photo credit should read NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP/Getty Images)  AFP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     (MoneyWatch) Many people say they want to live a long time, but they don't really understand the financial implications of that wish. If you don't make the necessary monetary preparations for a long life, you could end up penniless and have to rely on family or the government safety net for support.  How long will you live?  Estimate your life expectancy -- change your life Experts warn of retirement crisis So how long might you live? This post follows up my last post , which discussed a recent report from the American Academy of Actuaries that addressed longevity risk -- the risk of living beyond your life expectancy.  The report, " Risky Business: Living Longer Without Income for Life ," contains estimates from the Social Security Administration tables of life expectancies for individuals currently age 65. According to the report, a man age 65 can expect to live a further 18.9 years on average; a 65-year-old woman can expect to be alive an additional 20.9 years. These life expectancies have increased by about five years since 1935, when the Social Security program was implemented (longer lifespans are one cause of Social Security's current financing issues).  But these life expectancies are just averages. What are the odds of beating the averages?  The "Risky Business" report shows that a 65-year-old man has about one in five odds of living to age 90 -- about six years longer than his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has almost one in three odds of living to age 90 -- four years longer than her life expectancy. And a 65-year-old couple has a 45 percent chance -- almost 50-50 -- that one of them will survive to age 90.  The Social Security tables represent the population at large, including people who smoke or work in unhealthy environments. How do the odds improve if you take care of your health? The report calculates the odds if you experience mortality rates -- the odds of dying in a year -- that are 75 percent of those on the Social Security's tables. These lower mortality rates can apply to you if you have above average education, a regular job, don't smoke, keep your weight at healthy levels, eat nutritious food and/or get regular exercise. If you die at these reduced mortality rates, you'll live longer than the population at large.  In this case, the odds are almost one in three that a 65-year-old man will live to age 90 and about one in eight that he'll live until age 95 -- 11 years beyond his life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman has 42 percent odds of living to age 90, and 21 percent odds (more than one in five) of living to age 95 -- nine years beyond her life expectancy.  The odds are 31 percent -- almost one in three -- that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to age 95. The odds are one in 10 -- 10 percent -- that one member of this couple will live to age 100.  But most people aren't financially prepared to live that long or deal with the uncertainty of their actual lifespan. Retirement planning would be easier if you knew exactly how long you'll live. So what can you do to protect yourself against the risk of living too long? Stay tuned for my next post.   © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Find out the eight secrets to a longer, healthier and fuller life   by Alanna Glassman Updated Sep 22, 2014   8                         Katharine Weber was born the same year a test aircraft, with wings of steel, silk and electrical tape, took off from an ice field in Baddeck, Nova Scotia. It was 1909, and it’s fitting that Katharine, who would become an intrepid world traveller, should share her birth year with Canada’s first flight.  Katharine celebrates her 103rd birthday this month. And a look at her life shows just how much can happen in a century. She was a child when tanks rolled across French battlefields in the First World War, she survived Canada’s Spanish-flu epidemic, and in her 20s was a secretary for a shipping company during the Great Depression.  She got married at 38 and, craving adventure, jetted off with her new husband to the Colombian rainforest in South America, where they lived until Katharine became pregnant with their first of two sons. Later, after her kids left home, she started travelling in earnest, with trips to Russia, Europe and Australia. At 82, she walked the Great Wall of China.  Often when we think of the elderly, we think of the frail and infirm, the grouchy or senile. We see aging as a losing battle, but Katharine is proof that it doesn’t have to be. She lives in the same house in Winnipeg where she raised her sons. She’s always been an avid gardener and last summer enjoyed fresh tomatoes from her backyard. She even entertains weekly and calculates her taxes at the close of every year.  On her 100th birthday, Katharine’s younger son toasted her full life. “When I think of how it must feel to live through general strikes, pandemics, world wars, cold wars — and two sons — my first thought is, I’d need some rest,” says Thomas Weber. “But I look at Mum, and she’s still going strong — sometimes baking cookies or on her hands and knees at midnight, scrubbing the floor.”  One large long-term study of people over 100 years old shows centenarians share many traits, tendencies and traditions, even when living oceans apart. Not surprisingly, Katharine embraces many of these healthy habits. And she’s reaped the rewards with almost no health complaints — even now she doesn’t rely on daily medications and hardly ever wears her glasses.  But aging is a complex process. And while many of the body’s genes begin to break down once you hit 40, mounting research suggests there are things you can do to slow it down. “Science shows we aren’t completely at the mercy of genetics,” says pharmacist and longevity expert Farid Wassef, author of Breaking the Age Barrier .  “We know that because of a study that reviewed the lifestyle habits and genetic backgrounds of twins separated at birth.” Turns out genes played a smaller- than-expected part in the twins’ likelihood of developing cancer, with their inherited DNA contributing only 28 percent of the risk. Dietitian Leslie Beck, author of Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet , agrees: “A long, healthy life requires good habits. Genes play a role, but the rest is up to you.”  What is Katharine’s secret to enjoying a healthy old age? She also attributes her longevity to more than good genes: She’s positive, she has faith in life, people and a higher power, and she constantly seeks out new experiences. Read on for more healthy habits that can help you join the longevity revolution!  1. Never act your age  In Okinawa, Japan, a region with the longest-living people in the world, residents are considered children until they hit 55, and a ritual called kajimaya heralds a return to youth on their 97th birthdays.  In Sardinia, Italy, the traditional greeting, a kent’annos (“May you live to be 100”) is appropriate in a place where age is celebrated and people work into their 90s.  Katharine doesn’t look or act her age. “Mum is definitely young at heart,” says Thomas. “She recently danced at her granddaughter’s wedding and still flies out to visit relatives in Ottawa and Vancouver.” Her adventurous spirit has kept her youthful. Katharine has never stopped searching for new experiences. In her 70s, she toured across Russia, Siberia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. A decade later, she made two treks to China. “Age has never stood in her way,” says her niece Katharine Bergbusch.  2. Shut down stress  Katharine has always embraced a quiet, simple life. “I try not to worry, I just try to live,” she says. “And I try to have enough trust and confidence in myself to deal with things as they come.” Consciously keeping stress at bay is also proven to be key in reducing your risk of chronic inflammation and keeping cortisol levels low (research shows prolonged cortisol spikes may accelerate aging, damaging areas of the brain associated with memory).  The best way to battle stress is to carve out time for the hobbies you enjoy. (Katharine knitted, sewed and made jam into her 90s and still bakes.) It’s also important to find time in your day for quiet reflection. Research shows meditation may increase the activity of enzymes that rebuild telomeres, the sequences of DNA linked to aging that act like the plastic ends of shoelaces — the more they fray, the more you show your age.  3. Eat quality Calorie restriction (CR) — eating 30 percent fewer calories per day without eliminating essential proteins, vitamins and minerals — has the potential to extend life and slow aging. In recent studies of rhesus monkeys, with whom we share 95 percent of our genes, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have followed the primates for over 20 years and found CR delayed the onset of many age-related diseases. Even more compelling: Those who consumed fewer calories were stronger and looked younger than their counterparts on regular diets. Twenty years after the study began, 80 percent of the calorie-restricted monkeys were still alive, compared with 50 percent of the monkeys on normal diets.  In another study comparing the diets of people aged 35 to 82 over a six-year period, those on eat-less plans improved their triglycerides, with 95 percent reporting levels lower than the average North American in her 20s.  Proponents of CR say it isn’t about deprivation: It’s a high-quality, low-calorie diet that might mean cutting 300 to 500 calories (a bag of chips and a soda) out of your day. Meals are planned with long-term nourishment in mind. Think nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits (seven to 10 servings), complex carbs that slowly release energy (unrefined whole grains and legumes) and healthy fats from olive oil and oily fish. “CR can be such a simple change that it looks like little more than a lean health food diet,” says Brian Delaney, co-author of The Longevity Diet .  Beck also notes the connection between calories and long life. “Calorie restriction is believed to extend lifespan in two ways: First, cutting calories reduces the production of free radicals, highly damaging forms of oxygen linked to aging. It also seems to increase the resistance of cells to stress, helping them live longer.”  4. Sleep and have sex “Most North Americans live in sleep deficit,” says Wassef. “If you look at long-lived cultures, you’ll see they get routine, adequate sleep. They prioritize it and they don’t feel guilty about it.” Lack of sleep can offset important hormonal balances and it contributes to weight gain, depression and heart disease.  A little nocturnal action also has lifelong benefits. A study by Duke Medical Center in North Carolina found a woman’s past enjoyment of sex (indicating a history of a healthy, active sex life) was one of the top three most important predictors for increased and enhanced longevity, adding as much as four extra years.  5. Move every day Exercising today offers benefits beyond tomorrow. Yoga, dance, tai chi and other core-building workouts improve balance to help you avoid falls as you age. “Turn your home, community and work into places that present you with natural ways to move,” says Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’ve Lived the Longest . “Focus on activities you love like gardening, walking and playing with your family.”  Research also shows the fountain of youth may flow between the treadmill and dumbbells. “Muscles weaken with age; physical activity helps rejuvenate their stem cells and promote circulation,” says Dafna Benayahu, a medical researcher at Tel Aviv University. “Regular workouts may undo signs of aging elsewhere in the body.” One study found the cells of gym users who clocked 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week looked about 10 years younger than non-exercisers. The best news is, it’s never too late to start. Another study found improved memory skills in women aged 65 to 75 who took up strength training once or twice a week.  6. Connect On Sundays, Katharine’s kitchen is filled with warm smells of foods reflecting her German heritage — roasts, rolanden or schnitzel. “Sunday dinners are a tradition we’re never going to give up,” says Thomas. All the way across the globe, centenarians cherish close ties. In Okinawa, they form part of a person’s ikigai , or reason to live. Elders connect with young people and report some of the lowest depression levels in the world. “Centenarians generally don’t stay isolated,” says Wassef. “Prolonged loneliness can weaken the immune system.” He points to a study involving 7,000 people: Women who felt friendless were five times more likely to die from breast, ovarian and uterine cancers.  7. Tweet about it There’s a growing movement in social networking among the 65-and-older set. Nearly half of all internet users are between the ages of 50 and 64, and social networking among those 50 and older rose from 22 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2010. Googling grandmas report up to a 30-percent decrease in loneliness and symptoms of depression, according to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet stresses the importance of stimulating your mind daily to keep your brain active and improve cognitive skills. On weekday mornings, Katharine does crossword or Sudoku puzzles and catches up on the Winnipeg Free Press to help her stay sharp.  8. Just believe A survey of centenarians found almost a quarter attributed longevity to their faith. Katharine doesn’t fear death, but she also doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. Instead, she finds peace in her belief in a higher power and the goodness of people. Her father was a Lutheran pastor, and she’s always taken an active role in church. According to Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet , when researchers look at the power of religion, they note the important benefits of believing in something outside of yourself. Even if you’re not religious, you can tap into the power of belief, whether it’s getting involved in your community, volunteering for a cause you find important or finding peace outdoors in nature.  Longevity hot spots  Lunenburg and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: One of the highest concentrations of Canadian centenarians lives along these craggy seaside coasts. Experts point to something special in the salty ocean breezes, people’s fish-rich diets and their stress-free community spirit.  Okinawa, Japan: This archipelago’s residents eat three times the vegetables, twice the fruit and 30 percent fewer calories than the average North American. Hara hachi bu (eight parts out of 10) governs each meal, meaning they stop eating when they’re 80 percent satisfied.  Sardinia, Italy: Evening meals are washed down with a glass of red wine squeezed from local grapes loaded with flavonoids, which are believed to reduce heart attack risk by up to 50 percent.  Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: This close-knit community enjoys a high-fibre diet of beans and corn, and dinner is the smallest meal of the day.  Icaria, Greece: Locals take regular midday naps, drink herbal teas every day and love goat’s milk, which has unique fatty acids that may protect against age-related inflammation.  Loma Linda, California: Many residents are practising Seventh-day Adventists, and researchers credit their health to a handful of nuts four to five days a week and alcohol- and nicotine-free lifestyles.  * This article was originally published on March 8, 2013.

Find out the eight secrets to a longer, healthier and fuller life   by Alanna Glassman Updated Sep 22, 2014   8                         Katharine Weber was born the same year a test aircraft, with wings of steel, silk and electrical tape, took off from an ice field in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

In another study comparing the diets of people aged 35 to 82 over a six-year period, those on eat-less plans improved their triglycerides, with 95 percent reporting levels lower than the average North American in her 20s.  Proponents of CR say it isn’t about deprivation: It’s a high-quality, low-calorie diet that might mean cutting 300 to 500 calories (a bag of chips and a soda) out of your day. Meals are planned with long-term nourishment in mind. Think nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits (seven to 10 servings), complex carbs that slowly release energy (unrefined whole grains and legumes) and healthy fats from olive oil and oily fish. “CR can be such a simple change that it looks like little more than a lean health food diet,” says Brian Delaney, co-author of The Longevity Diet .  Beck also notes the connection between calories and long life. “Calorie restriction is believed to extend lifespan in two ways: First, cutting calories reduces the production of free radicals, highly damaging forms of oxygen linked to aging. It also seems to increase the resistance of cells to stress, helping them live longer.”  4. Sleep and have sex “Most North Americans live in sleep deficit,” says Wassef. “If you look at long-lived cultures, you’ll see they get routine, adequate sleep. They prioritize it and they don’t feel guilty about it.” Lack of sleep can offset important hormonal balances and it contributes to weight gain, depression and heart disease.  A little nocturnal action also has lifelong benefits. A study by Duke Medical Center in North Carolina found a woman’s past enjoyment of sex (indicating a history of a healthy, active sex life) was one of the top three most important predictors for increased and enhanced longevity, adding as much as four extra years.  5. Move every day Exercising today offers benefits beyond tomorrow. Yoga, dance, tai chi and other core-building workouts improve balance to help you avoid falls as you age. “Turn your home, community and work into places that present you with natural ways to move,” says Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’ve Lived the Longest . “Focus on activities you love like gardening, walking and playing with your family.”  Research also shows the fountain of youth may flow between the treadmill and dumbbells. “Muscles weaken with age; physical activity helps rejuvenate their stem cells and promote circulation,” says Dafna Benayahu, a medical researcher at Tel Aviv University. “Regular workouts may undo signs of aging elsewhere in the body.” One study found the cells of gym users who clocked 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week looked about 10 years younger than non-exercisers. The best news is, it’s never too late to start. Another study found improved memory skills in women aged 65 to 75 who took up strength training once or twice a week.  6. Connect On Sundays, Katharine’s kitchen is filled with warm smells of foods reflecting her German heritage — roasts, rolanden or schnitzel. “Sunday dinners are a tradition we’re never going to give up,” says Thomas. All the way across the globe, centenarians cherish close ties. In Okinawa, they form part of a person’s ikigai , or reason to live. Elders connect with young people and report some of the lowest depression levels in the world. “Centenarians generally don’t stay isolated,” says Wassef. “Prolonged loneliness can weaken the immune system.” He points to a study involving 7,000 people: Women who felt friendless were five times more likely to die from breast, ovarian and uterine cancers.  7. Tweet about it There’s a growing movement in social networking among the 65-and-older set. Nearly half of all internet users are between the ages of 50 and 64, and social networking among those 50 and older rose from 22 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2010. Googling grandmas report up to a 30-percent decrease in loneliness and symptoms of depression, according to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet stresses the importance of stimulating your mind daily to keep your brain active and improve cognitive skills. On weekday mornings, Katharine does crossword or Sudoku puzzles and catches up on the Winnipeg Free Press to help her stay sharp.  8. Just believe A survey of centenarians found almost a quarter attributed longevity to their faith. Katharine doesn’t fear death, but she also doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. Instead, she finds peace in her belief in a higher power and the goodness of people. Her father was a Lutheran pastor, and she’s always taken an active role in church. According to Leslie Beck’s Longevity Diet , when researchers look at the power of religion, they note the important benefits of believing in something outside of yourself. Even if you’re not religious, you can tap into the power of belief, whether it’s getting involved in your community, volunteering for a cause you find important or finding peace outdoors in nature.  Longevity hot spots  Lunenburg and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: One of the highest concentrations of Canadian centenarians lives along these craggy seaside coasts. Experts point to something special in the salty ocean breezes, people’s fish-rich diets and their stress-free community spirit.  Okinawa, Japan: This archipelago’s residents eat three times the vegetables, twice the fruit and 30 percent fewer calories than the average North American. Hara hachi bu (eight parts out of 10) governs each meal, meaning they stop eating when they’re 80 percent satisfied.  Sardinia, Italy: Evening meals are washed down with a glass of red wine squeezed from local grapes loaded with flavonoids, which are believed to reduce heart attack risk by up to 50 percent.  Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: This close-knit community enjoys a high-fibre diet of beans and corn, and dinner is the smallest meal of the day.  Icaria, Greece: Locals take regular midday naps, drink herbal teas every day and love goat’s milk, which has unique fatty acids that may protect against age-related inflammation.  Loma Linda, California: Many residents are practising Seventh-day Adventists, and researchers credit their health to a handful of nuts four to five days a week and alcohol- and nicotine-free lifestyles.  * This article was originally published on March 8, 2013.

Will you be among them? You won't know if you're among the genetically predisposed for sure, of course, until those 100 birthday candles are lit. But researchers are discovering more and more clues as to who's on his or her way.  Clue #1: How many elderly relatives are on your family tree?  What it may mean: You may have longevity genes.  At least half of all those who reach 100 have a parent, sibling, or grandparent who has also achieved very old age (90-plus), according to the New England Centenarian Study at the Boston University School of Medicine, which studies 100-plussers to unlock secrets of successful aging.    Advertisement              A 2002 study by the center's director, geriatrician Thomas Perls, found that male siblings of centenarians have a 17 times greater chance of reaching their 100th birthday than other men born around the same time; female siblings are 8.5 times more likely to hit 100 than other females also born around the same time.  Other studies have found that exceptional aging is often clustered among multiple first-tier family members, supporting a genetic link. Having siblings, parents, and grandparents who make it to 100 seems to be a much stronger indicator than counting cousins and other more distant relatives.  Clue #2: How fast and how far can you walk?  What it may mean: You're in good condition for the long haul.  Faster walkers live longer. University of Pittsburgh researchers crunched numbers from nine different studies including almost 35,000 subjects ages 65 or older. The result: For each gait speed increase of 0.1 meters per second came a corresponding 12 percent decrease in the risk of death.    Advertisement         The average speed was 3 feet per second (about two miles an hour). Those who walked slower than 2 feet per second (1.36 miles per hour) had an increased risk of dying. Those who walked faster than 3.3 feet per second (2.25 miles per hour) or faster survived longer than would be predicted simply by age or gender.  A 2006 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that among adults ages 70 to 79, those who couldn't walk a quarter mile were less likely to be alive six years later. They were also more likely to suffer illness and disability before death. An earlier study of men ages 71 to 93 found that those who could walk two miles a day had half the risk of heart attack of those who could walk only a quarter mile or less.  Clue #3: Do you have a lot of people in your life?  What it may mean: Social engagement is a key lifespan-extender.  Countless studies have found that social isolation is bad for your health, while having friends and social engagement is good. One of the more surprising findings in The Longevity Project (a book about an eight-decade study of 1,500 subjects all born around 1910) is that religious women lived longer -- primarily, as it turned out, because of the social connectedness of their faith-based lifestyle. That is, they worshipped with others, joined committees, and engaged in social outreach, from clothing drives to soup kitchens.  "There was a clear, similar trend among people who had civic engagements, were active in their communities, volunteered, and otherwise stayed connected, whether with families, friends, or coworkers," says Leslie R. Martin, a professor of psychology at La Sierra University in Riverside, California, who's the coauthor of The Longevity Project .  More clues that you could live to 100  Clue #4: Are you a woman?  What it may mean: Odds are more in your favor from the start.  Sorry, fellas. In 2010, there were 80,000 centenarians in the U.S.; 85 percent of them were women, and only 15 percent were men.  It's not entirely clear what's causing the disparity. Theories include the protective role of female sex hormones and menstruation, lower rates of cardiovascular disease for women, and higher smoking rates among men. Men also have higher rates of car accidents and suicide.  The survival gap is gradually narrowing, however, possibly because women are living lives that are conventionally male in terms of stress and poorer health habits, especially smoking.  One bit of good news for men: Those who do reach the century mark are, on average, healthier and more functionally fit than their female counterparts. Women survive medical catastrophes better than men but with more disability.  Clue #5 (for women only): Did you have a child after age 35?  What it may mean: This is possible evidence that you're a slow ager.  Popular wisdom holds that late-life babies are tougher on a mother's aging body. If so, that graying hair mixed with newborn pink or blue reflects a silver lining: According to the New England Centenarian Study, a woman who naturally conceives and bears a child after the age of 40 has a four times greater chance of living to 100 than women who don't. Moms who give birth naturally at 35-plus also make it to 100 in larger numbers than younger counterparts.  It's not the act of bearing a child late in life that extends lifespan, however. Researchers instead believe that being able to conceive and give birth in your late 30s or 40s is probably an indicator that your reproductive system is aging slowly -- and that therefore the rest of your body is likely to be aging slowly, as well.  Clue #6: When were you born?  What it may mean: Growing lifespans give younger people an edge.  A 2011 report by the British Department for Work and Pensions estimated life expectancy for citizens at various ages, providing a snapshot that Yanks can learn from, too.  A British girl born this year has a one in three chance of living to 100; a 2011-born boy has a one in four chance. If you're a 20-year-old woman, you have a 26.6 percent chance; a 20-year-old man has a 19.5 percent chance.  The average 50-year-old woman in the U.K. has a 14.6 percent chance of seeing 2061, the year of her diamond-anniversary birthday; just over one in 10 of her male counterparts will still be around then.  And if you're 99 now? You have a whopping 67 percent chance of seeing another year.  Clue #7: Do you worry -- but not too much?  What it may mean: There's a "healthy" worry level.  It sounds like a punch line: "Be afraid, be very afraid -- but not too much!" So-called "catastrophizers" -- Eeyore-like personalities who fret about impending doom, see the glass as half-empty, and are harshly self-critical -- tend to die sooner, according to psychology professor Leslie R. Martin of La Sierra University.  On the other hand, a moderate amount of anxiety and worry is associated with a 50-percent decreased risk of death in any given year, she says. Moderate worriers tend to be less impulsive, take fewer risks, have less risky hobbies, and plan for alternatives, which may all be protective without adding a negative health impact.  More clues that you could live to 100  Clue #8: Is your weight normal -- or are you only slightly overweight?  What it may mean: You have better odds of reaching 100 than if you were obese.  A surprising 2011 Albert Einstein College of Medicine study of 477 adults ages 95 to 112 found that these solid-gold agers had no better health habits overall than a comparison group born at the same time that had been studied in the 1970s. One difference: Those in long-lived group were much less likely to be obese.  Both male and female centenarians in the study were overweight at about the same rates as those in the shorter-lived group. But only 4.5 percent of the long-lived men and 9.6 of the women were obese, compared to 12.1 percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, of the younger-lived controls. ("Normal weight" is a Body Mass Index -- or BMI, a measure of height in proportion to weight -- in the range of 18 to 24; "overweight" is 25 to 30; over 30 is "obese.")  This finding echoes other studies showing the greatest risks of death among those who are obese or underweight at age 65 (BMI under 18.5), compared to those of normal weight or slight overweight. A 2011 study at Loma Linda University in Southern California found that men over age 75 with a BMI over 27.4 lived nearly four years less than those with a lower BMI. For women over age 75, a BMI over 27.4 led to a two-year shorter lifespan. Studies of centenarians show that men who reach 100 are almost always lean (more so than women).  Luckily, this clue is one you can control. "Since you can't be sure if you'll live to 100, I wouldn't take the chance of ignoring the lifestyle interventions that we know will at least put you in the half the population who die after age 80 -- starting with watching weight and being sure to exercise," says the senior author of the Albert Einstein study, Nir Barzilai, director of the college's Institute for Aging Research.  Clue # 9: How long are your telomeres?  What it may mean: Many people who live to 100 have a hyperactive version of an enzyme that rebuilds telomeres.  "What-o-meres?" you ask. Telomeres are protective DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes that gradually shorten as cells divide. (Pioneering telomere researcher Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California-San Francisco compares them to shoelace caps.) Eventually the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing, a condition called senescence, creating the effects we recognize as aging in related tissue.  Scientists are still unraveling the key role telomeres seem to play in aging, cancer, and other biological processes, but this much is clear: The longer your telomeres, the more time you're apt to have left. A 2010 Italian study reported that cancer-free people with shorter telomeres were more likely to develop cancer within ten years than those with longer telomeres, for example.  Some studies show that removing chronic stress, not smoking, and eating a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can improve telomere length. Those centenarians with hyperactive telomere-making apparatus can probably thank their genes, though.  New blood tests are now being marketed directly to consumers, purporting to predict longevity based on telomere length. But critics caution that there aren't standards for measuring telomere length and that there can be such variability in telomeres that it's hard to predict much of anything from a sample.  Clue #10: Are you a positive person?  What it may mean: Emotion influences health, which influences aging.  Some studies have shown that an upbeat attitude about aging adds years. But long-term studies conducted at the Stanford Longevity Center show that emotions, more than attitudes, may be the biologic mechanism at work, says Laura Carstensen, the center's director.  "What's the mechanism at work here? Feeling upbeat about your life means you experience less stress, which in turn affects cortisol levels, which can affect health," she says. Stanford researchers periodically assess 19 different emotions in subjects randomly polled over 1 week at 5-year intervals. Having more positive emotions than negative ones is associated with living longer.  Carstensen is a firm believer that while "slow agers" clearly exist, there's more to their stories than lucky genes. "There's mounting evidence that genes play a role in longevity, but genes play a role in almost everything," she says. "They don't express themselves in vacuums -- there are very complex interactions between genes and lifestyle." So all that advice on how to live to 100 ? Can't hurt to heed it.

Do old people with more muscle than other people their age live longer?         about 3 years,  Ric's wife  said...     We live, I am sad to say, in a society where things often get 'thrown away'..even older people..long before the time is due. I see elderly neighbors, and it is obvious to me that NO ONE is looking in on them, stopping by, calling..they are neglected. Period. On the other hand...I discovered as my friend Joe started to really decline that the law states, "an elderly person has the right to refuse help - even if that refusal hastens his or her demise." (!!) A perfectly idiotic law. And Alz is making that a game changer. Because, your 'independent family member/neighbor' might be leaving a pot on the stove and causing a fire, thus the local Engine company must come and douse it..is endangering the entire building. And a good neighbor of ours was removed to a nursing home after the third fire, by order of the management Board. Truly, as I observe my elderly colleagues and family members I know each is unique, and although the factors in play for every person are different, some have one person in the family circle shouldering everything. Some have a circle of involved people. But support groups are there, and a friend found a church group that began to help out, along with referrals to home aides and eventually, assisted care. It is truly exhausting and depressing to come home after a day of paying bills, cleaning up, and going head to head with someone who outright balks at your kind help. And often by the time the person needs it, it is too late for them to even understand and reflect that they DO. Take care of yourself as you struggle and deal with a situation like this. Reach out for help. And while we're about it... put your dimwit, selfish family members on notice, those who 'keep meaning to go and see Aunt Hepzibah/Dad/Grandmom', to get off their butts and help!. I see inequities like this every day; and am not the least bit shy about speaking up. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, and no way should one person carry the load for all, especially when caring for an elderly loved one with serious dementia, and related medical challenges. The unintended consequence of living longer can sometimes be dementia. Not all people remain active, engaged and clearheaded, dear Lord - would that it could be so. Bless the folks who are fortunate enough to mountain climb, and do it all..right up to the very end.. And bless those who are not so lucky, and lastly, those steadfast folks who must care for them!         about 3 years,  popsie  said...     Great article.  I would also add volunteering - doing something for others         about 3 years,  LadyLew  said...     Well, I've got a mixed bag of factors; this indicates, I suppose, that I probably won't make it to 100, but I'll at least make it to my next birthday (Feb 19) at which time I'll be entering my 74th year.         about 3 years, a fellow commenter  said...     my Nan was a solitary person and lived to 97 years of age, my mum walked fast everyday, had loads of friends was out every weekend and died at 57.

One of my siblings has heart problems (2nd heart surgery at 55).  One has survived a very rare cancer (Thymoma), and the other I don't know much about his health.

I'll change what I can, but like some of the other posters, I only want to live as long as I am useful.  Once I'm a power drain, let me go!         over 4 years,  hurting heart  said...     Helpful, somewhat, but how can you be a positive person when there is so much negative around you when you are caregiving a person with dementia?         over 4 years,  Danny Kowkabany  said...     Great article, 

Thank you,         almost 5 years, a fellow commenter  said...     I only want to live until my usefulness is gone....be it 75 or 100 . After that, let me go or give me something to do do even if it's shelling peas or licking stamps.  A doctor once said: "The secret to a long, HAPPY life is to get up every day with something to do." We cannot control things like dementia or disease, to a large degree, but have the kindness to find a caring place to take care care of your loved one so you can visit often but have a life of your own. There are many caring places, I have worked in one and know of others - just do your research and your part to oversee their care if you can't.  My mother-in-law lived to be 100 in her own home with round the clocks sitters like the Queen of England and was robbed of her valuables and self respect - all because her two sons could not do the right thing and put her in a nice place nearby.  I do not want to live to be 100 like this.  Who does?  Life is not meant to be extended by a number, but by dignity.  Once that is gone, you might as well be dead. No more articles about living to be 100!         almost 5 years,  YaYaBaby  said...     Your great...no complaints here. Keep up the good work & educating us!         almost 5 years,  sami_  said...     not thanks         over 5 years,  zambezi  said...     Ric's wife is helping people who help to whatever extent they can when they are needed. Imagine every day that you woke up with a depressed person who would not do anything to help yourself and actively resisted living with you because she wanted to be in her own home. She doesn't help. She doesn't go anywhere, she doesn't like anything and she hates me. I have enough grief to carry with my daughter's pulmonary embolism at age 36, my son's terminal illness, my husband's kidney transplant that is rejecting and my father's death from prostate cancer and my mother's death from breast cancer. I do not have the emotional resilience to carry someone else's grief and sour puss every moment of the day. Nor will my mother-in-law consider going to counseling to pop her giant zit of misery. My simple message is this: I cannot continue to do it all for everyone. I am caving in myself. And the only way my mother-in-law has made it to 97 is because I have done all the care, cooking, cleaning, working to supplement our depleted savings, washing her clothes, changing her diapers and getting nothing in return but a kick when her son, my husband, is out of the room and then she tells me I hit her. His undivided loyalty needs to be with me. And I simply can't do this any more. My neighbors have moved out. My children live 20 hours away by car. There is NO backup. My husband WON'T pay for respite care. I cannot leave her on the floor if she falls at night. I don't know how to make it any clearer. Is she "living to 100?" Yes, she will. Will I? No, I won't. Again, one of the indicators of longevity is the support system that takes the stress so the elderly patient can survive.         over 5 years,  zambezi  said...     To Caring Community and the authors who wrote this initial article:
When you wrote about the factors that enable people to reach 100, you forgot to include that most of that goes to being cared for by caregivers who lose out on their own longevity to provide care under stress. That's how I got into answering here instead of at resource articles. Your article needed some indication of ongoing support. Centenarians do not take care of themselves.         over 5 years,  Ric's wife  said...     Well, one thing is certainly true: age, and just plain living, brings us through may experiences. We all face challenges: poverty, illness, loneliness, the steady erosion of independence - I see this daily, when I visit my seniors. Each has a story to tell, and each has weathered some appalling personal crisis. The death of a loved partner, reduced financial circumstances, growing frailty. These are indeed realities of being elderly in our society. So, I don't know what to say about the 'bad part of getting older'.. pessimism about one's state, and future may in some cases be justified. But for my people, all of whom have multiple reasons to feel lousy the moment they get out of bed in the morning - they actually don't choose to DO that. They are involved in life, and I let them natter away at me, while I prepare coffee, mop, clean out their fridge, help them with the grocery list. And I suspect that that may be a clue to Mary (90) Joe (89) and my Mom, Lucille (90) still chugging along, and showing no signs of slowing down. I am, as some know, just a 'whippersnapper' of 64 myself, but when we had the fire at our building, these so called 'doddery' oldsters were calling up, taking time, comforting ME!! Their reassurance, wisdom and perspective (one senior neighbor of mine remembers the Holocaust) kept me from losing my mind. Do they sometimes feel angry, or put-upon? Sure enough. But they're still alive and, facing things head-on. Another clue? While I truly savor my moments of repose and calm, I am no fool to think they can last 24/7. I take my older friends 'vinegar in the greens' points of view as something that frequently comes in quite handy in the real world. And that 'tude may also prolong life.         over 5 years,  Caring Community  said...     Hello All, Thank you for your comments.

To all those hoping to live to be 100, be very, very careful what you wish for because it might come true and you might not like what it brings.         over 5 years,  Ric's wife  said...     For further hints I suggest reading LOST HORIZON, by James Hilton, and Conway's conversation with the High Lama, who is well past the age of 100. Moderation in all things, a philosophy of work balanced with spirituality. Not always possible in our high tech world, I grant you - but there are may leaves from the Lama's worldview that can work for us, and give us a very wise perspective on ways to navigate through life's troubles, and challenges. Of course in the case of Shangri La, these people live away from all the hurly burly, but I often open the book, and gain insights from the way they view and approach the stresses of life. And, of and by itself it's also a wonderful read, even though it was written in the 1930's just as the WW2 Axis wheels were cranking in gear. Hilton's book nevertheless contains timeless, heartwarming insights that touch... and can teach us all a thing or two!         over 5 years,  zambezi  said...     One last observation about my own comments. I was initially trying to warn caregivers to set up backup before they get stuck with all of the responsibilities, sharing with siblings or adult children or respite care. But I got into the abyss of venting because I am literally moving out in a week or so and nobody, especially an overburdened caregiver like you or anyone else, needs to hear bad news when they are seeking hope.

Will You Live To Be 100?  Life expectancy is up as people are living longer than ever before, thanks to a number of factors including improvements in health science and technology. However, living to the age of 100 remains a remarkable and somewhat rare feat. Individuals aged 100 or older, referred to as centenarians, make up less than one percent of the U.S. population. What are the odds that you’ll live to age 100?  What Centenarians and Life Expectancy Tell Us Today  According to the U.S. Census Special Report on Centenarians, in 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the United States or 1.73 per 10,000 people in the total population. The Centenarian Special Report also shed light on a few interesting facts about centenarians alive today:    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT        Geography Matters  To start with, the United States falls behind other developed countries in terms of the proportion of centenarians to the total population:      Country Centenarian Share of the Total Population      Japan 3.43 per 10,000    France 2.70 per 10,000    United Kingdom 1.95 per 10,000    Sweden 1.92 per 10,000    United States 1.73 per 10,000      Moreover, there are regional differences within the United States. Centenarians comprise a higher proportion of the total regional population in the Midwest and Northeast and a lower share in South and the West.  The Odds Dramatically Higher for Women Than Men  While life expectancy has risen overall, women continue to live longer than men, a trend that is reinforced in current data on centenarians. Women make up 82.8% of individuals age 100 years and older while men make up just 17.2%.  The Odds of Living to 100 Change Over Time, Generational Cohort  Overall, the trend for life expectancy is one of increase. Since 1970, life expectancy in the U.S. has risen by nearly a decade, from 70.8 years to 79 years today. Additionally, in 2011 in the United Kingdom (where life expectancy is 81 years old, roughly two years higher than in United States), the Department for Work and Pensions released a report listing the chances of living to age 100 by year of birth:   Search by Year of Birth     Year of Birth Male Female Both Sexes      1912 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1913 0.30% 1.10% 0.70%    1914 0.30% 1.20% 0.70%    1915 0.30% 1.20% 0.80%    1916 0.40% 1.30% 0.80%    1917 0.40% 1.40% 0.90%    1918 0.50% 1.60% 1.10%    1919 0.70% 1.90% 1.30%    1920 0.60% 1.80% 1.20%    1921 0.70% 2.10% 1.40%    1922 0.80% 2.30% 1.60%    1923 1.00% 2.50% 1.70%    1924 1.10% 2.70% 1.90%    1925 1.20% 3.00% 2.10%    1926 1.40% 3.20% 2.30%    1927 1.60% 3.50% 2.50%    1928 1.70% 3.80% 2.80%    1929 2.00% 4.20% 3.10%    1930 2.30% 4.60% 3.40%    1931 2.50% 5.10% 3.80%    1932 2.90% 5.60% 4.20%    1933 3.20% 6.20% 4.70%    1934 3.60% 6.80% 5.20%    1935 4.00% 7.30% 5.60%    1936 4.30% 7.90% 6.10%    1937 4.60% 8.40% 6.50%    1938 5.00% 8.90% 6.90%    1939 5.20% 9.30% 7.20%    1940 5.40% 9.60% 7.50%    1941 5.70% 9.90% 7.80%    1942 6.00% 10.30% 8.10%    1943 6.20% 10.60% 8.40%    1944 6.40% 10.90% 8.60%    1945 6.60% 11.10% 8.90%    1946 6.90% 11.50% 9.20%    1947 7.10% 11.80% 9.50%    1948 7.40% 12.20% 9.80%    1949 7.70% 12.50% 10.10%    1950 7.90% 12.80% 10.40%    1951 8.20% 13.10% 10.60%    1952 8.40% 13.50% 10.90%    1953 8.60% 13.70% 11.20%    1954 8.80% 14.00% 11.40%    1955 9.10% 14.40% 11.70%    1956 9.30% 14.70% 12.00%    1957 9.50% 14.90% 12.20%    1958 9.80% 15.20% 12.50%    1959 10.00% 15.60% 12.80%    1960 10.20% 15.90% 13.10%    1961 10.50% 16.20% 13.30%    1962 10.70% 16.50% 13.60%    1963 11.00% 16.80% 13.90%    1964 11.20% 17.10% 14.20%    1965 11.50% 17.40% 14.50%    1966 11.80% 17.70% 14.70%    1967 12.00% 18.10% 15.00%    1968 12.30% 18.40% 15.30%    1969 12.50% 18.70% 15.60%    1970 12.80% 19.00% 15.90%    1971 13.10% 19.40% 16.20%    1972 13.30% 19.70% 16.50%    1973 13.60% 20.00% 16.80%    1974 13.90% 20.40% 17.10%    1975 14.20% 20.70% 17.40%    1976 14.50% 21.10% 17.80%    1977 14.80% 21.40% 18.10%    1978 15.10% 21.70% 18.40%    1979 15.40% 22.10% 18.70%    1980 15.70% 22.40% 19.10%    1981 16.00% 22.80% 19.40%    1982 16.30% 23.10% 19.70%    1983 16.60% 23.50% 20.10%    1984 17.00% 23.80% 20.40%    1985 17.30% 24.20% 20.70%    1986 17.60% 24.50% 21.10%    1987 17.90% 24.90% 21.40%    1988 18.20% 25.30% 21.70%    1989 18.50% 25.60% 22.10%    1990 18.90% 26.00% 22.40%    1991 19.20% 26.40% 22.80%    1992 19.50% 26.70% 23.10%    1993 19.90% 27.10% 23.50%    1994 20.20% 27.50% 23.80%    1995 20.50% 27.80% 24.20%    1996 20.90% 28.20% 24.50%    1997 21.20% 28.50% 24.90%    1998 21.50% 28.90% 25.20%    1999 21.90% 29.30% 25.60%    2000 22.20% 29.60% 25.90%    2001 22.60% 30.00% 26.30%    2002 22.90% 30.40% 26.60%    2003 23.20% 30.70% 27.00%    2004 23.60% 31.10% 27.30%    2005 23.90% 31.50% 27.70%    2006 24.30% 31.80% 28.10%    2007 24.60% 32.20% 28.40%    2008 25.00% 32.60% 28.80%    2009 25.30% 32.90% 29.10%    2010 25.70% 33.30% 29.50%    2011 26.00% 33.70% 29.90%      Our odds of living to 100 are dramatically better than those of our grandparents, and babies born today have it even better.

Just this week, I'm announcing my retirement at work — effective in June — and it was terrific to have a cheery prognostication of nearly thirty years to enjoy it in! (And that's without looking up my blood pressure figures, which I'm always told are stellar!) Your "test" was easy and fun to take and encourages me to continue doing what I do well and to address those areas where I know I could improve. Now, if the results only came with a guarantee...

The answer may be in your genes.                  By Marlene Cimons   By Marlene Cimons   December 14, 2015     Mary Harada’s father lived to 102, healthy and sharp to the end. She wouldn’t mind living that long, if she could stay as mentally and physically fit as he was. “He died sitting in his chair,’’ says Harada, 80, a retired history professor who lives in West Newbury, Mass. “He was in excellent shape until his heart stopped.’’  She may, in fact, have a good chance of getting there. Longevity experts believe that extreme old age — 100 or older — runs in families, and often is strikingly apparent in families where there are several siblings or other close relatives who have reached that milestone. (Harada’s great-aunt — her father’s aunt — also lived an extremely long life, to 104.)  Moreover, researchers are finding that many of those who live to extreme old age remain in remarkably good condition, delaying the onset of such chronic and debilitating age-related illnesses as cancer, heart disease and diabetes until close to the end of their lives, and a certain percentage don’t get them at all.   [ Tech Titan’s Latest Project: Defying Death ]   “It’s one thing to live to be 100 and quite another to live to be 100 and be in good shape,’’ says Winifred K. Rossi, deputy director of the Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology at the National Institute on Aging. The institute is sponsoring an ongoing study of more than 500 families with long-lived members that involves nearly 5,000 individuals. “Something is going on that has protected them from the bad stuff that causes problems for other people earlier in life.’’    ( Martin Tognola for The Washington Post)   Experts attribute healthy longevity to a combination of good genes and good behaviors. Good behaviors play a greater role than genes in getting you to your mid-to-late 80s — don’t smoke or drink alcohol, exercise regularly and eat healthfully — while getting beyond 90, and to 100 or even older, probably depends more heavily on genes, they say. Families with a cluster of members with exceptional longevity don’t occur by chance, they say, but probably from familial factors they all share.  Growing numbers  Centenarians have become a fast-growing group in this country. In 1980, there were 32,194 Americans age 100 or older. By 2010, the number had grown to 53,364, or 1.73 centenarians per 10,000 people, according to the Census Bureau . This represents a 65.8 percent increase during that period, compared with a 36.3 percent rise in the general population.  Moreover, the number of Americans 90 and older nearly tripled during the past three decades, reaching 1.9 million in 2010, and is expected to more than quadruple between 2010 and 2050, according to the bureau. Globally, the number of centenarians is expected to increase tenfold during that time, according to the aging institute.  This is probably due to numerous factors, among them improved health care, dietary changes and reduced rates of smoking.  “When I started practicing, it was rare to see someone of 100, but now it’s not that strange at all,’’ says Anne B. Newman, director of the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Pittsburgh. “More people have had the opportunity to get there,’’ largely because of advances in public health and medicine.  But as the numbers of very old have increased and the examination of human genetics has become more sophisticated, researchers have been trying to discover the genetic and biological factors that contribute to a life span of 100 or older and why some centenarians stay healthy for so long. Not surprisingly, what they are finding is complicated and far from a one-size-fits-all answer.  “Aging is not simple,’’ says Thomas Perls, a professor of medicine at Boston University and director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston Medical Center. “There are many different biological mechanisms involved in aging, so it makes sense that there are different genes involved. We are still in the infancy of figuring this out.’’      The average American can expect to live for about 80 years. But that may change as scientists develop new ways to prolong human life.

But that may change as scientists develop new ways to prolong human life. In this game, you will have access to seven promising tools. Play to learn more. Can you make it to 100 years or beyond?   Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, has been conducting several studies that focus on inherited genetic and biological influences that promote longevity.  In 2003, for example, his team discovered that centenarians, especially women, and their offspring have significantly higher HDL, or good cholesterol, which protects against heart disease, hypertension and metabolic syndrome , a series of risk factors that raise the chances of heart disease, diabetes and stroke.  The results , which found HDL levels of 60 and higher within this group — anything lower than 50 raises the risk of heart disease — suggest a heritable trait “that promotes healthy aging,’’ he says. This isn’t surprising, considering that women outlive men overall and — in 2010 — nearly 83 percent of centenarians were female, according to the Census Bureau.  Unusual chemistry  The Einstein researchers also have found that centenarians and their offspring often make unusually large amounts of a peptide (a short chain of amino acids) called humanin, which declines with age in most people and whose loss contributes to the development of Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. This may help explain why those who produce higher levels of humanin enjoy greater protection against those diseases and experience exceptionally long lives. For these individuals, humanin diminishes as they age, too, but the levels are much higher to start with than those of average people.  Barzilai believes the propensity for high levels of both HDL and humanin is heritable: “Offspring of centenarians have higher levels of humanin than their parents. Same with HDL. It declines with age, so it’s more apparent in the offspring.’’  Perls and his colleagues, in a study released almost four years ago, concluded there is no single common gene variant responsible for exceptional longevity. Rather, after examining about 280 gene variations, they discovered a series of gene combinations — nearly two dozen, in fact — that they believe contribute to long lives, “meaning there are different ways to get to these old ages,’’ Perls says. “It’s like playing the lottery. If you get all seven numbers, you’ll hit the jackpot.’’  These genetic groupings also seem to be involved in protecting against developing age-related diseases, since the scientists did not find an absence of disease-causing genes in their study group. “They have just as many as everybody else, which was a big surprise to us,’’ Perls says.  Also, the researchers found that the children of these healthy centenarians stay healthy longer than their same-age counterparts. The offspring of centenarians show 60 percent less heart disease, stroke, diabetes and hypertension, and 80 percent fewer overall deaths when they are in their early 70s, than those who were born at the same time but who do not have longevity in their families.  “They remain incredibly healthy into their 70s and 80s, and their mortality rate is very low, compared to others born at the same time,’’ Perls says.  Perls has studied 2,300 centenarians since 1995, including “super-centenarians’’ of 110 or older, and their offspring. He says about 45 percent of those who reach 100 manage to delay chronic age-related diseases until after they turn 80, and about 15 percent never get them at all.  Furthermore, he found that “semi-super-centenarians’’ — that is, those who are 105 to 109 — and super-centenarians don’t develop those diseases until roughly the final 5 percent of their very long lives. “They are dealing with diseases much better than the average person,’’ he says, who is more likely to develop these diseases in the 60s and 70s.  Many eventually die from the same diseases as non-centenarians, “but they do it 30 years later,’’ Barzilai says.  ‘An additional 10 years’  Perls says that if you want to know whether you will live to 100, “you don’t have to do all this complicated genetic testing. Just look at your family and your health-related behaviors.’’ If you engage in healthful practices, you could reach your late 80s. “If you have the genes for longevity and you fight them [with risky behaviors], you will chop time off,’’ he says. “But if there is longevity in your family and you don’t do those things, you might get an additional 10 years past 90.’’  Newman agrees. “Don’t underestimate how powerful lifestyle is in longevity,’’ she says. “Even if longevity runs in your family, your life expectancy still will be more influenced by how you take care of yourself. If you have a centenarian parent, don’t count on living to 100 if you smoke, drink, eat a high-fat diet, and are sedentary and sleep-deprived.’’  Mary Harada thinks less about her genes and more about the unexpected event — breaking a bone, for example — that could make her a burden to her adult children.  “I don’t spend much time thinking about how long I’m going to live,’’ she says. “Whatever happens, happens. I spend more time thinking about how long I’m going to stay in my current house.’’  She has no age-related diseases and always has taken good care of herself. She has been a runner for 47 years, and she lifts weights. She shuns smoking and avoids most processed foods. She lives alone — her husband died last year — and she does most of the maintenance in and around her four-bedroom house, including leaf removal, routine yard work and spending two hours every 10 days in spring and summer mowing a very hilly lawn.  “I’ve lived here for 40 years, and I like living in this house and in this town,’’ she says. “If I could be like my father, and not break anything, I would stay here another five to 10 years. That would be wonderful.’’   Cimons — whose mother lived to be 100 — writes frequently about health issues for The Post.

Through the power of actuarial estimates, it is possible to figure out approximately how long you are likely to live. We made a set of charts, based on data from the Social Security Administration's cohort life tables , that show, given your gender and current age, the probability that you will reach some particular later age. Naturally, these are based on averages for a particular age group — health conditions and lifestyle choices like diet, exercise, and smoking can vastly alter one's life expectancy. Regardless, this is important information for anyone who has to think about things like retirement and estate planning. Here are the charts, in descending order by present age: If you are an 80 year old man, your long-term odds are not great. There is a 30% chance of making it to your 90th birthday, and only about 14 in 1,000 will see 100. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration 70 year olds have a somewhat better prognosis. Almost 2/3 of 70 year old men and almost 3/4 of 70 year old women will live at least another ten years, and over 1/5 of men will make it to 90, as will 1/3 of women. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For 60 year olds, we see some of the benefits of modern medicine kicking in. The overwhelming majority of 60 year olds will live until at least 70, and majorities will get to at least 80. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Similarly, very few people who make it to 50 die before they turn 60. As we look at younger and younger cohorts, we see better and better long-term odds as well. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration For people turning 40, comfortable majorities will see 80, and one in twenty women who are currently 40 will be able to blow out 100 birthday candles someday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Dying in your thirties is an extremely old-fashioned idea. Only 1.5% of thirty year old men, and just 0.9% of thirty year old women will die before their fortieth birthday. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration The late 21st century will have more than its fair share of elderly millenials. 60% of twenty year old men and 70% of twenty year old women will live to see the year 2074. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration One interesting aspect of this data is that the Social Security administration projects that the gap in longevity between men and women will continue into the future. Even among today's ten year olds, girls are likely to outlive boys. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Social Security Administration Finally, children born today will live longer than any other generation. About 2/3 will live past 80, and 1/3 past 90. Almost one in ten girls born now will live past 100.

Herman/For The Daily It                                                     Life expectancy is up as people are living longer than ever before, thanks to a number of factors including improvements in health science and technology. However, living to the age of 100 remains a remarkable and somewhat rare feat. Individuals aged 100 or older, referred to as centenarians, make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. What are the odds that you’ll live to age 100? According to the U.S. Census Special Report on Centenarians, in 2010, there were 53,364 centenarians in the United States or 1.73 per 10,000 people in the total population. The Centenarian Special Report also shed light on a few interesting facts about centenarians alive today: 1) Geography matters To start with, the United States falls behind other developed countries in terms of the proportion of centenarians to the total population. Japan has the highest number of centenarians, with 3.43 per 10,000 citizens, followed by France, United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United States, with 1.73 per 10,000 citizens. Moreover, there are regional differences within the United States. Centenarians comprise a higher proportion of the total regional population in the Midwest and Northeast and a lower share in South and the West. 2) Odds dramatically higher for women than men While life expectancy has risen overall, women continue to live longer than men, a trend that is reinforced in current data on centenarians. Women make up 82.8 percent of individuals age 100 years and older while men make up just 17.2 percent.  3) Odds of living to 100 change over time Overall, the trend for life expectancy is one of increase. Since 1970, life expectancy in the U.S. has risen by nearly a decade, from 70.8 years to 79 years today. Additionally, in 2011 in the United Kingdom (where life expectancy is 81 years old, roughly two years higher than in United States), the Department for Work and Pensions released a report listing the chances of living to age 100 by year of birth. To see the listing, go to http://discovertheodds.com/what-are-the-odds-of-living-to-100 .       It’s pretty safe to say that your odds of living to 100 are dramatically better than those of your grandparents, and babies born today have an even better chance of becoming centenarians. — Source: http://discovertheodds.com/what-are-the-odds-of-living-to-100/                       This Week's Circulars                                                            ADVERTISERS        This Week's Circulars                   Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter                                                                                 First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
