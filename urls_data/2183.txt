The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don‚Äôt matter. The fact you‚Äôre alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you‚Ä¶   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let‚Äôs remember there are people out there that can‚Äôt eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don‚Äôt feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that ‚Äúit‚Äù may be. Unfortunately, people aren‚Äôt grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don‚Äôt have. When you see regret in a person‚Äôs eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn‚Äôt. No matter the shit hand you‚Äôre dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don‚Äôt care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you‚Äôre actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water ‚Äî in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 ‚Äî yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes!

The speculation is that this is nature‚Äôs way of countering the relatively high mortality rates of males, and creating more of a gender balance in the population. While historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide ‚Äî which creates a ‚Äúsex ratio at birth‚Äù of 1.05 ‚Äî the share of boy babies has increased in recent decades. 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 1.07, or 107 boys born for every 100 girls.  This increase in the sex ratio is driven largely by births in China, where sex ratios have declined slightly in recent years but remain the highest in the world. The world‚Äôs most populous country has 118 boys for every 100 girls, and accounts for 12% of births worldwide. However, disproportionately large shares of baby boys are found in other countries scattered throughout Asia and the Caucasus, as well. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, South Korea, and the Solomon Islands round out the list of places with the highest sex ratios. India is tied with Macedonia, Montenegro, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Serbia and Suriname for 7th¬†place, with a ratio of 108 boys born for every 100 girls.  Even while some countries seem to have a disproportionate share of boys, others have particularly high shares of baby girls. While there are still slightly more boys born than girls in these places ‚Äî which are centered in sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äî the sex ratios are nonetheless much lower than average. The six countries with the lowest sex ratios include: Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar.  So what explains these differences in the shares of baby boys and girls?  Perhaps the best-known reason relates to the practice of sex-selective abortion , which has been identified in Asia, and in the Caucasus , as well. The ability to determine fetal sex, along with strong son preferences, accounts in large part for the high shares of boys in many countries in these regions. The desire to limit family size, either due to government regulations as in China, or due to global social and economic changes that have reduced the need for large families, seems to further contribute to sex-selective abortion and a dearth of baby girls.  But this is only one of myriad factors that may be affecting the sex ratio at birth. Some research suggests that the share of newborn boys declines with older parents , and that the high share of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to the practice of polygamy (multiple wives). What do these two phenomena have in common? Researchers hypothesize that both situations are associated with less frequent intercourse . (For possible explanations of this association, see this article from the academic journal Human Reproduction .)  On the opposite end of the spectrum, most research shows that the share of baby boys increases during and after wartime . And once again, frequency of intercourse is cited as the likely reason, at least in the case of post-war reunions.  In some cases, though, wartime is associated with a higher share of girl babies. This may relate to the fact that heightened maternal stress , such as would occur during wartime, can lead to an increased likelihood of a miscarriage which is more likely to occur among male fetuses .  Further evidence of this association between maternal stress and the increased share of girl babies emerges from an analysis of births in the vicinity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which showed that the share of females born nine months after that event was significantly higher than would have been expected under normal circumstances.

Using the latest available data from the American Community Survey, NCCP researchers found that in 2015, while 30 percent of adults have low incomes, more than 40 percent of all children live in low-income families ‚Äî including 5.2 million infants and toddlers under 3. Despite significant gains in household income and reductions in the overall poverty rate in recent years, 43 percent (30.6 million) of America‚Äôs children are living in families barely able to afford their most basic needs, according to Basic Facts about Low-Income Children, the center‚Äôs annual series of profiles on child poverty in America.  ‚ÄúWhile food assistance, public health insurance, and other programs have certainly had a mitigating effect on poverty for many families, the fact remains that in the United States young children have close to a one in two chance of living on the brink of poverty,‚Äù said Ren√©e Wilson-Simmons, DrPH, NCCP director. ‚ÄúBut being a child in a low-income or poor family doesn‚Äôt happen by chance, and neither should our approach to alleviating child poverty. In the coming weeks, hundreds of new leaders will take the helm at agencies responsible for implementing policies that touch the lives of poor children and affect their odds of success in life. It‚Äôs imperative that they do so with a real understanding of the disadvantages millions of Americans face from very young ages and what growing up poor looks like in America.‚Äù  Available online at http://www. nccp. org/ publications/ fact_sheets. html , the Basic Facts About Low-Income Children fact sheets illustrate the severity of economic instability faced by low-income and poor children throughout the United States. NCCP defines a poor household as one where incomes are below the federal poverty threshold (i.e., $24,036 for a family of four with two children in 2015). Families with earnings less than twice the poverty threshold are considered low income and include poor families (i.e., $48,072 for a family of four with two children in 2015). According to NCCP researchers, the number of children in low-income families increased slightly from 42 percent in 2009 to 43 percent in 2015, and the percent of poor children in the U.S. increased by 1 percentage point.  ‚ÄúThe fact that we have nearly 300,000 more children living near poverty today than at the height of the Great Recession is concerning,‚Äù added NCCP director of Family Economic Security Heather Koball. ‚ÄúThe anxiety, depression, and constant stress of being financially vulnerable leaves a lasting mark on children as they grow to adulthood, affecting earnings potential and health outcomes. These figures illustrate why it‚Äôs essential for advocates and policymakers to understand the long-term impact of child poverty and the factors ‚Äî like parental education and race/ethnicity ‚Äî that appear to distinguish low-income and poor children from their more economically advantaged peers.‚Äù  These are some of the findings in the 2017 edition of Basic Facts about Low-Income Children:  * Children have been largely left out of economic gains in the U. S. since the Great Recession. Although one million fewer children lived in poverty in 2015 than the prior year, the percentage of children on the economic brink remains stubbornly high: 43 percent of children under age 18 (30.6 million) lived in low-income households and 21 percent lived in poor families (14.8 million). By comparison, at the height of the Great Recession in 2009, 42 percent (30.4 million) of children were considered low income and 20 percent (14.5 million) lived in poor households.   Disparities in child poverty persist along racial lines. Children of color accounted for approximately 49 percent of all young people in 2015, but were overrepresented among those living in poor and low-income families. More than 60 percent of black, Hispanic, and Native American kids live in low-income families, compared to 30 percent of Asian and white children ‚Äî a dynamic largely unchanged in recent years.  The majority of children in low-income families have at least one parent who works full time, all year long. Children whose parents are employed full time are less likely to live below the poverty line, but earning a wage was no guarantee of economic security in 2015, according to NCCP research. More than half (53 percent) of low-income children and 31 percent of poor children live with at least one parent employed full time, throughout the year.   Published annually since 2009, Basic Facts about Low-Income Children presents demographic characteristics and socioeconomic conditions of poor and low-income children in fact sheets for five age groups, from infants and toddlers to adolescents.  Part of Columbia University‚Äôs Mailman School of Public Health, the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) is the nation‚Äôs leading public policy center dedicated to promoting the economic security, health, and well-being of America‚Äôs low-income families and children.

Create an account [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  14 points 15 points 16 points  3 years ago *  (8 children) EDIT: I interpreted this question to mean calculating the odds of being on of those people above the poverty line in one of those countries which is close to the odds of having been born above the poverty line in one of those countries.  Oh I can answer this! Firstly, we need to find which ones are the First world countries. According to this site they are   Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UK, USA  Israel, Japan, South Korea  Australia, New Zealand  Austria, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland.   We need to find their populations and poverty lines. There are two poverty lines - national (defined by the country) and international (internationally accepted). As it turns out there's no data on the international poverty line of first world countries. I'm assuming this is because the number must be negligible. The national poverty line is usually a small number (as you'll see below) so it's safe to assume the international poverty line is 0 for those countries. We'll rely on the national poverty lines. This will be a tedious process but we can do it. Here we go. The first number is the total population of the country national poverty line and how many people live below it.   Belgium - 11,198,638, 15.2% and 1,702,193  Canada - 35,427,524, 9.4% and 3,330,187  Denmark - 5,634,437, 13,4% and 755,015  France - 65,906,000, 6.2% and 4,086,172  Germany - 80,716,000, 15.5% and 12,510,980  Greece - 11,123,034, 20% and 2,224,607  Iceland - 326,340, 10% and 23,634  Italy - 60,782,668, 18.2% and 11,062,446  Luxembourg - 549,700, 11% and 60,467  Netherlands -16,857,700, 10.5% and 1,770,058  Norway - 5,124,383, 4.3% and  220,348  Portugal - 10,477,800, 18% and 1,886,004  Spain - 46,609,700, 26.4% and 12,304,961  Turkey - 76,667,864, 16.9% and 12,956,869  UK - 63,181,775 , 14% and 8,845,449  USA - 318,326,000, 15.1% and 48,067,226  Israel - 8,193,900, 23.6% and 1,933,760  Japan - 127,090,000, 16% and 20,334,400  South Korea - 50,423,955, 15% and 7,563,593  Australia - 23,546,600, 12.5% and 2,943,325  New Zealand - 4,538,710, 15% and 680,807  Austria - 8,504,850, 6% and 510,291  Ireland - 4,593,100, 5.5% and 27,121  Sweden - 9,675,885, 12.9% and 1,248,189  Switzerland - 8,160,900, 6.9% and  563,102   A lot of those figures are from different years but the numbers should be roughly the same.   Total - 1,040,107,463 (1 Billion). The number of people living under the national poverty line of each country combined is 156,011,204.   That is 884,096,259 live above the poverty line of their respective countries. The world population is about 7.046 Billion. Therefore the probability of you having been born to be one of the people living above poverty line in one of the First world countries is  P = 884,096,259/7,046,000,000 = 12.55%  TL;DR: 12.55%. Consider yourself lucky if you are one of those people!  EDIT: I interpreted this question to mean calculating the odds of being on of those people above the poverty line in one of those countries which is close to the odds of having been born above the poverty line in one of those countries. The odds of being born to parents who are above the poverty line right now will be slightly different. If anyone wants to calculate those odds, you'll need to find the birth rates for each country, see how many babies will be born above the poverty line in say 1 year, and see how many babies will be born overall in the world in that same year. The odds will be the ratio of the two numbers.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] Dalroc Cool Guy  6 points 7 points 8 points  3 years ago  (4 children) Don't you think birth rates (and maybe child mortality?) of said countries, and the rest of the world, should be taken into account as well?   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (3 children) I interpreted the question to mean the odds of having been born in one of these countries not the odds of being born there right now.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Dalroc Cool Guy  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (2 children) Yes, but there have been more births (and deaths) in under developed countries, than in first world countries. Therefore the chance should be even lower? You can of course use the birth and mortality rates from the time when you (or whoever wants to know) were born, if you don't want to use todays statistics.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (1 child) Oh yea, in all likelihood the chances are even lower because the birth rate in developing countries is much higher. I don't think the mortality rates matter because we're only asking what are the odd of being born now.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Dalroc Cool Guy  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Well the mortality rate affects the total number of people, which you use as a base. If you work out of birth rates only, then you wouldn't need mortality rates.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] CWRules  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (2 children) You've given the odds of living in a first world country above the poverty line, not the odds of being born there. u/Dalroc is right, you'll probably have to do something with birth rates.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (1 child) Oh I see, I've interpreted the question differently. The odds of being born right now who are above the poverty line will make for a more difficult calculation.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] crb11 24‚úì  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) According to 2011 OECD figures quoted on Wikipedia the world birth rate was 19.4 per 1000 people each year. The larger countries in the list above have a birth rate ranging from about 8 (Germany, Japan) to 13 (UK, USA) except for Turkey (16). You can work out a weighted average of these by population, which is likely to come out about 11. However, you also need to allow for the fact that in general, those in poverty have more children than the average, so this figure is going to drop somewhat. I'd guess the final answer works out about 7%.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . ¬© 2018 reddit inc.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don‚Äôt matter. The fact you‚Äôre alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you‚Ä¶   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let‚Äôs remember there are people out there that can‚Äôt eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don‚Äôt feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that ‚Äúit‚Äù may be. Unfortunately, people aren‚Äôt grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don‚Äôt have. When you see regret in a person‚Äôs eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn‚Äôt. No matter the shit hand you‚Äôre dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don‚Äôt care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you‚Äôre actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water ‚Äî in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 ‚Äî yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes!

The speculation is that this is nature‚Äôs way of countering the relatively high mortality rates of males, and creating more of a gender balance in the population. While historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide ‚Äî which creates a ‚Äúsex ratio at birth‚Äù of 1.05 ‚Äî the share of boy babies has increased in recent decades. 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 1.07, or 107 boys born for every 100 girls.  This increase in the sex ratio is driven largely by births in China, where sex ratios have declined slightly in recent years but remain the highest in the world. The world‚Äôs most populous country has 118 boys for every 100 girls, and accounts for 12% of births worldwide. However, disproportionately large shares of baby boys are found in other countries scattered throughout Asia and the Caucasus, as well. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, South Korea, and the Solomon Islands round out the list of places with the highest sex ratios. India is tied with Macedonia, Montenegro, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Serbia and Suriname for 7th¬†place, with a ratio of 108 boys born for every 100 girls.  Even while some countries seem to have a disproportionate share of boys, others have particularly high shares of baby girls. While there are still slightly more boys born than girls in these places ‚Äî which are centered in sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äî the sex ratios are nonetheless much lower than average. The six countries with the lowest sex ratios include: Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar.  So what explains these differences in the shares of baby boys and girls?  Perhaps the best-known reason relates to the practice of sex-selective abortion , which has been identified in Asia, and in the Caucasus , as well. The ability to determine fetal sex, along with strong son preferences, accounts in large part for the high shares of boys in many countries in these regions. The desire to limit family size, either due to government regulations as in China, or due to global social and economic changes that have reduced the need for large families, seems to further contribute to sex-selective abortion and a dearth of baby girls.  But this is only one of myriad factors that may be affecting the sex ratio at birth. Some research suggests that the share of newborn boys declines with older parents , and that the high share of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to the practice of polygamy (multiple wives). What do these two phenomena have in common? Researchers hypothesize that both situations are associated with less frequent intercourse . (For possible explanations of this association, see this article from the academic journal Human Reproduction .)  On the opposite end of the spectrum, most research shows that the share of baby boys increases during and after wartime . And once again, frequency of intercourse is cited as the likely reason, at least in the case of post-war reunions.  In some cases, though, wartime is associated with a higher share of girl babies. This may relate to the fact that heightened maternal stress , such as would occur during wartime, can lead to an increased likelihood of a miscarriage which is more likely to occur among male fetuses .  Further evidence of this association between maternal stress and the increased share of girl babies emerges from an analysis of births in the vicinity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which showed that the share of females born nine months after that event was significantly higher than would have been expected under normal circumstances.

(AP/Bebeto Matthews)  (REPORT) ‚Äî Out of all age groups, children are still most likely to live in poverty, according to new research from the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) at Columbia University‚Äôs Mailman School of Public Health. Using the latest available data from the American Community Survey, NCCP researchers found that in 2015, while 30 percent of adults have low incomes, more than 40 percent of all children live in low-income families ‚Äî including 5.2 million infants and toddlers under 3. Despite significant gains in household income and reductions in the overall poverty rate in recent years, 43 percent (30.6 million) of America‚Äôs children are living in families barely able to afford their most basic needs, according to Basic Facts about Low-Income Children, the center‚Äôs annual series of profiles on child poverty in America.  ‚ÄúWhile food assistance, public health insurance, and other programs have certainly had a mitigating effect on poverty for many families, the fact remains that in the United States young children have close to a one in two chance of living on the brink of poverty,‚Äù said Ren√©e Wilson-Simmons, DrPH, NCCP director. ‚ÄúBut being a child in a low-income or poor family doesn‚Äôt happen by chance, and neither should our approach to alleviating child poverty. In the coming weeks, hundreds of new leaders will take the helm at agencies responsible for implementing policies that touch the lives of poor children and affect their odds of success in life. It‚Äôs imperative that they do so with a real understanding of the disadvantages millions of Americans face from very young ages and what growing up poor looks like in America.‚Äù  Available online at http://www. nccp. org/ publications/ fact_sheets. html , the Basic Facts About Low-Income Children fact sheets illustrate the severity of economic instability faced by low-income and poor children throughout the United States. NCCP defines a poor household as one where incomes are below the federal poverty threshold (i.e., $24,036 for a family of four with two children in 2015). Families with earnings less than twice the poverty threshold are considered low income and include poor families (i.e., $48,072 for a family of four with two children in 2015). According to NCCP researchers, the number of children in low-income families increased slightly from 42 percent in 2009 to 43 percent in 2015, and the percent of poor children in the U.S. increased by 1 percentage point.  ‚ÄúThe fact that we have nearly 300,000 more children living near poverty today than at the height of the Great Recession is concerning,‚Äù added NCCP director of Family Economic Security Heather Koball. ‚ÄúThe anxiety, depression, and constant stress of being financially vulnerable leaves a lasting mark on children as they grow to adulthood, affecting earnings potential and health outcomes. These figures illustrate why it‚Äôs essential for advocates and policymakers to understand the long-term impact of child poverty and the factors ‚Äî like parental education and race/ethnicity ‚Äî that appear to distinguish low-income and poor children from their more economically advantaged peers.‚Äù  These are some of the findings in the 2017 edition of Basic Facts about Low-Income Children:  * Children have been largely left out of economic gains in the U. S. since the Great Recession. Although one million fewer children lived in poverty in 2015 than the prior year, the percentage of children on the economic brink remains stubbornly high: 43 percent of children under age 18 (30.6 million) lived in low-income households and 21 percent lived in poor families (14.8 million). By comparison, at the height of the Great Recession in 2009, 42 percent (30.4 million) of children were considered low income and 20 percent (14.5 million) lived in poor households.   Disparities in child poverty persist along racial lines. Children of color accounted for approximately 49 percent of all young people in 2015, but were overrepresented among those living in poor and low-income families. More than 60 percent of black, Hispanic, and Native American kids live in low-income families, compared to 30 percent of Asian and white children ‚Äî a dynamic largely unchanged in recent years.  The majority of children in low-income families have at least one parent who works full time, all year long. Children whose parents are employed full time are less likely to live below the poverty line, but earning a wage was no guarantee of economic security in 2015, according to NCCP research. More than half (53 percent) of low-income children and 31 percent of poor children live with at least one parent employed full time, throughout the year.   Published annually since 2009, Basic Facts about Low-Income Children presents demographic characteristics and socioeconomic conditions of poor and low-income children in fact sheets for five age groups, from infants and toddlers to adolescents.  Part of Columbia University‚Äôs Mailman School of Public Health, the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) is the nation‚Äôs leading public policy center dedicated to promoting the economic security, health, and well-being of America‚Äôs low-income families and children.

Create an account [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  14 points 15 points 16 points  3 years ago *  (8 children) EDIT: I interpreted this question to mean calculating the odds of being on of those people above the poverty line in one of those countries which is close to the odds of having been born above the poverty line in one of those countries.  Oh I can answer this! Firstly, we need to find which ones are the First world countries. According to this site they are   Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UK, USA  Israel, Japan, South Korea  Australia, New Zealand  Austria, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland.   We need to find their populations and poverty lines. There are two poverty lines - national (defined by the country) and international (internationally accepted). As it turns out there's no data on the international poverty line of first world countries. I'm assuming this is because the number must be negligible. The national poverty line is usually a small number (as you'll see below) so it's safe to assume the international poverty line is 0 for those countries. We'll rely on the national poverty lines. This will be a tedious process but we can do it. Here we go. The first number is the total population of the country national poverty line and how many people live below it.   Belgium - 11,198,638, 15.2% and 1,702,193  Canada - 35,427,524, 9.4% and 3,330,187  Denmark - 5,634,437, 13,4% and 755,015  France - 65,906,000, 6.2% and 4,086,172  Germany - 80,716,000, 15.5% and 12,510,980  Greece - 11,123,034, 20% and 2,224,607  Iceland - 326,340, 10% and 23,634  Italy - 60,782,668, 18.2% and 11,062,446  Luxembourg - 549,700, 11% and 60,467  Netherlands -16,857,700, 10.5% and 1,770,058  Norway - 5,124,383, 4.3% and  220,348  Portugal - 10,477,800, 18% and 1,886,004  Spain - 46,609,700, 26.4% and 12,304,961  Turkey - 76,667,864, 16.9% and 12,956,869  UK - 63,181,775 , 14% and 8,845,449  USA - 318,326,000, 15.1% and 48,067,226  Israel - 8,193,900, 23.6% and 1,933,760  Japan - 127,090,000, 16% and 20,334,400  South Korea - 50,423,955, 15% and 7,563,593  Australia - 23,546,600, 12.5% and 2,943,325  New Zealand - 4,538,710, 15% and 680,807  Austria - 8,504,850, 6% and 510,291  Ireland - 4,593,100, 5.5% and 27,121  Sweden - 9,675,885, 12.9% and 1,248,189  Switzerland - 8,160,900, 6.9% and  563,102   A lot of those figures are from different years but the numbers should be roughly the same.   Total - 1,040,107,463 (1 Billion). The number of people living under the national poverty line of each country combined is 156,011,204.   That is 884,096,259 live above the poverty line of their respective countries. The world population is about 7.046 Billion. Therefore the probability of you having been born to be one of the people living above poverty line in one of the First world countries is  P = 884,096,259/7,046,000,000 = 12.55%  TL;DR: 12.55%. Consider yourself lucky if you are one of those people!  EDIT: I interpreted this question to mean calculating the odds of being on of those people above the poverty line in one of those countries which is close to the odds of having been born above the poverty line in one of those countries. The odds of being born to parents who are above the poverty line right now will be slightly different. If anyone wants to calculate those odds, you'll need to find the birth rates for each country, see how many babies will be born above the poverty line in say 1 year, and see how many babies will be born overall in the world in that same year. The odds will be the ratio of the two numbers.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] Dalroc Cool Guy  6 points 7 points 8 points  3 years ago  (4 children) Don't you think birth rates (and maybe child mortality?) of said countries, and the rest of the world, should be taken into account as well?   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (3 children) I interpreted the question to mean the odds of having been born in one of these countries not the odds of being born there right now.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Dalroc Cool Guy  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (2 children) Yes, but there have been more births (and deaths) in under developed countries, than in first world countries. Therefore the chance should be even lower? You can of course use the birth and mortality rates from the time when you (or whoever wants to know) were born, if you don't want to use todays statistics.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (1 child) Oh yea, in all likelihood the chances are even lower because the birth rate in developing countries is much higher. I don't think the mortality rates matter because we're only asking what are the odd of being born now.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Dalroc Cool Guy  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Well the mortality rate affects the total number of people, which you use as a base. If you work out of birth rates only, then you wouldn't need mortality rates.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] CWRules  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (2 children) You've given the odds of living in a first world country above the poverty line, not the odds of being born there. u/Dalroc is right, you'll probably have to do something with birth rates.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] SpaceEnthusiast  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (1 child) Oh I see, I've interpreted the question differently. The odds of being born right now who are above the poverty line will make for a more difficult calculation.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] crb11 24‚úì  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) According to 2011 OECD figures quoted on Wikipedia the world birth rate was 19.4 per 1000 people each year. The larger countries in the list above have a birth rate ranging from about 8 (Germany, Japan) to 13 (UK, USA) except for Turkey (16). You can work out a weighted average of these by population, which is likely to come out about 11. However, you also need to allow for the fact that in general, those in poverty have more children than the average, so this figure is going to drop somewhat. I'd guess the final answer works out about 7%.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . ¬© 2018 reddit inc.
