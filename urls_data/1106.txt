Daily Probability Chart          About the Labor Predictor  Will you go into labor today? Tomorrow? Next week? The labor predictor estimates the odds of spontaneous labor on a given day based on where you are relative to your due date using statistical modeling.  Take the Probabilities With You  Wondering what the probability is of going into labor before your due date, or before your induction date?

About the Model Prior research has shown that the distribution of spontaneous labor approximates a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 9 [1]
  or 13 days [2].  These studies provide the initial building blocks for our model, but fail to paint a complete picture.    
  Neither distribution does a good job of estimating the number of preterm deliveries.  The CDC has found that 9.6% of babies are born prematurely , 
  before 37 weeks.  The normal distribution based on [1] and [2], however, would predict less than 3% of babies
  are born prematurely (.03% and 2.7% respectively).
  In fact,
  [1] specifically excluded preterm deliveries from their analysis which
  is why their model predicts so few preterm babies, which explains why it's model predicts so few of them.  The normal distribution is favored in these types of applications for it's simplicity and tendency to fit the data.
  In this case, however, the normal distribution is likely an over simplification.
  A key drawback is that the normal distribution is a symmetric distribution.  
  That means two points equally far from the mean will have the same probability.  A symmetric distribution that predicts 10% of babies
  will be born before 37 weeks will also predict 10% of babies will be born after 43 weeks.  For all the births prior to 30 weeks,
  there would be a similar number of births after 50 weeks.
  Additionally, in a symmetric distribution 
  the median (point
  which half of all women would have gone into labor), is equal to the mode (most common day to go into labor.)  In prior studies,
  however, the mode date is typically after the median [2]. Although not scientific, conventional wisdom is that the most
  common day to go into labor is around 41 weeks. Taken together,
these data points suggests that a skewed normal distribution might be more appropriate.
The skewed normal distribution is a family of distributions that includes
the normal distribution, however the skewed normal distribution need not be symmetric.  Where the normal distribution is
defined by two parameters
(mean and standard deviation), the skewed normal distribution is defined by three (location, shape and scale).  Using mean squared error we identified a skewed normal
distribution that closely approximates the normal distribution identified with prior research (MSE of 0.002), accounted
for 10% of spontaneous labors occurring prematurely, and predicted roughly half of all women would go into labor before 
their due date and half after.   [1] H. Kieler; O. Axelsson; S. Nilsson; U. Waldenströ (1995). "The length of human pregnancy as calculated by

  incorporates
  the possibility of preterm spontaneous labor.  Like [1], most online models predict the probability of spontaneous labor
  before 37 weeks is approximately zero. As you can see
     
 from the Full Chart we estimate the probability of spontaneous labor before 37 weeks as 9.6%, matching the number from the CDC .
  If you're past 37 weeks, this distinction will be less important.  
  Before 37 weeks and our model will serve you much better.  Differences between Labor Probability Chart and the Labor Probability Calculator You may notice the probabilities differ between the Labor Probability Chart  and the Labor Probability Calculator .  That is because the two apps are modeling two similar sounding, yet different events.  
  This Labor Probability 
  Chart shows the probability of spontaneous 
  labor for a pregnant woman without considering how far along
  she is in her pregnancy.  
  The Labor Probability Calculator shows the probability of spontaneous based on how far along she is
  by renormalizing the distribution to include only the possible remaining days in a woman's pregnancy.
  After all, for a woman who hasn't gone into labor by today the probability of spontaneous labor starting yesterday is, by definition, 0%.
  Statistically speaking it's the difference between the probability of labor at 40 weeks 0 days in general, p _labor (40w0d) ,
  and the probability of labor at 40 weeks 0 days for a woman who is already 39 weeks along, p _labor (40w0d|39WeeksAlong) .  This website is intended for general information & entertainment purposes only.

Giving Birth Before Your Due Date: Do All 40 Weeks Matter?  New guidelines redefine "full-term pregnancy." Understand the impact that your delivery date can have on your baby's health. By Jeanne Faulkner, R.N.  Facebook  Pinterest  Text  Email     Motherhood Maternity  Your due date is in sight and you only have a few weeks to go. In fact, you're so close, you'd be happy to get the show on the road and have your baby now. What's the harm? Your doctor told you, after all, that at 37 weeks , you're close enough to your due date that its safe to have your baby. In fact, why not get your calendar out and book the date and make things easy? Why go through the last miserable couple weeks of pregnancy if you don't really have to? That's what countless women were told during the 80s, 90s and 2000s when the induction craze was at its peak. As it turns out, those last few weeks are just as important as any other phase of pregnancy , and "close enough" doesn't always cut it. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has redefined the meaning of "term pregnancy." Pregnancies used to be considered at term, and babies ready for delivery, any time after 37 weeks. If mom went past that, those last three weeks (or longer) were almost seen as a write-off. Now, however, after a couple of decades that have seen too many C-sections and record numbers of babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), those last few weeks of pregnancy are being taken seriously. That's why "term pregnancy" is now being broken down into distinct categories. Term Pregnancy: Categories - Early Term: Between 37 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days - Full Term: Between 39 weeks 0 days and 40 weeks 6 days - Late Term: Between 41 weeks 0 days and 41 weeks 6 days - Poster: Between 42 weeks 0 days and beyond Doctors and hospitals have learned so much from the mistakes made back in the day when inductions and C-sections were as easy to schedule as a haircut ,and were often done with mothers who were only 37 - 38 weeks pregnant . Many of these procedures were done not out of medical necessity, but for convenience sake--for example, to make sure grandma could be at the birth, or so mom could be sure her own doctor would be on-call during her labor. But because due dates are often miscalculated, especially by ultrasound, doctors were frequently delivering premature babies who wound up spending time in the NICU. And many of these inductions were unsuccessful because mom's body was not ready to go into labor. These women wound up with C-sections they most likely wouldn't have needed if they'd waited for labor to start on its own. Slowly but surely the birth culture of "induction or C-section on demand" has changed. Now, most doctors have received the memo that unnecessary inductions are potentially dangerous for moms and babies. If there are solid, compelling medical reasons to induce or schedule a C-section, then, by all means, that's what those procedures are there for. However, if the medical reason can wait until a baby is full term, mothers and babies both fare better. If there's no reason to induce or do surgery, then for heaven's sake–don't do it. That's why these guidelines were developed, because finally, FINALLY, the medical community understands that "close enough to the due date" isn't always good enough. Lots of essential "finish work" is done in the last few weeks of pregnancy and we're learning more every day about the negative consequences we're inflicting on babies when we cut short their time in the uterus. Another great thing about these guidelines is that it spells out that a woman isn't really "over due" when she goes past her due date a week or two. For a long time now, doctors have been fixed on that 40-week mark as if a timer will go off and all hell's going to break loose if the baby isn't born lickety-split. Their concern is about babies growing too big for mom's pelvis, or a placenta growing too old to sustain baby. While those things do occasionally happen, they don't happen very often. Since post due date pregnancies put doctors on the defense (legally speaking) however, the birth culture pressed hard for women to accept medical interventions to push them into labor once the buzzer went off. The thing is that prior to when all those crazy inductions took over the birth industry in the 80s and well into the 2000s, women delivered safely a week or two past their due dates all the time and it was no big deal. Sure, they were crazy uncomfortable and frustrated, but nobody considered that there was anything wrong with them. These new guidelines send the message that women and their doctors need to hear: So what if the baby's a little late? No biggie. He or she will come when really, truly ready to be born. Frankly, we think mom's body knows when that time is far better than anybody else. Jeanne Faulkner, R.N., lives in Portland, Oregon with her husband and five children. Got a question for Jeanne?

September 29, 2014  Amy Kiefer  16 Comments     Can we please stop with this due date nonsense already?  Yes, the due date is not a precise date , only an estimate. And yes,  most women will deliver within 2 weeks of their so called “due date”.  But the due date has bigger problems.   Actual birth data, from real pregnant women, shows that the due date is not only an imprecise delivery estimate–as any single day would be–it is 1-4 days too early . Statistically-speaking, it is biased. And bias is bad .  If you knew nothing about due dates, you might reasonably suppose that the due date is the average date of delivery.  And you’d be wrong. The due date is NOT the average delivery day of a large, modern reference sample of pregnant women. The due date is also NOT the day on which pregnant women most commonly deliver (the mode). It is NOT the day by which half of pregnant women have typically delivered, and half have not (the median). No, the average, the mode, and the median delivery days are all 1-4  days after the “due date “.  So why care about the due date at all? Well, modern medicine has given us one very concrete reason for concern: Due dates act as a medical deadline. Go a week past yours, and you will be urged to have labor induced. Go two weeks past and an induction is all but assured. If you have severe gestational diabetes, and your due date will likely be treated as a hard stop, and your doctor will insist on an induction at the 40 week mark.  So what IS a due date?  The “due date” comes from a calculation known as Naegele’s rule , in which 280 days are added to the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period.  Naegele’s rule has proved remarkably enduring. Naegele, a director at a German hospital, developed his rule in the early 1800s, long before ovulation predictor kits, over-the-counter pregnancy tests, prenatal ultrasounds, fetal nonstress tests, pitocin–in short, before all of modern obstetrics. His calculation of pregnancy length relied not only on the duration of actual, observable pregnancies, but was also greatly influenced by biblical scholarship indicating that the gestation of Christ lasted for ten lunar months .  Not surprisingly, Naegele’s rule has some problems. The first, imprecision , is pretty obvious to people with ovaries: His rule assumes menstrual cycles are consistent in length, exactly 28 days long, with ovulation occurring precisely on day 14. Ovulation is less predictable than that. And many, many women’s cycles are shorter or longer than 28 days. Have a longer cycle, and the due date will likely underestimate the real delivery date. Have a shorter cycle, and the due date may overestimate it.  The second problem, bias , is far more concerning:  The average actual delivery date is later than the one predicted by Naegele’s rule. This is especially true for first-time mothers. In a study of 114 Caucasian women , women with 1 or more deliveries under their belts delivered an average of 3 days after their due dates; first time mothers delivered an average of 8 days after their due dates. Another study of 1,514 women with reliable conceptions dates found that first-time mothers went an average of 4 days “late;” women with a previous birth went 2 days “late.”  Other large studies back up these findings: Naegele’s rule consistently underestimates the average delivery date by 2-4 days (see here ).  Note, though, that estimates apply best to Caucasian women. For unknown reasons, women of Asian or African ancestry tend to give birth about a full week earlier than do Caucasians .  Is there a more accurate way to calculate a “due date”?  Yes. One way is to shift Naegele’s rule. Adding 282 days to the first day of the last menstrual period, instead of 280, provides a more accurate estimate. But, if available, an estimate based on a first trimester ultrasound is the best option . Using ultrasound-based due dates, 92% of pregnancies delivered within the normal range of 37-42 weeks; using due dates, this percentage fell to 87%.  One day off. Two days off. Who really cares? Actually, this bias matters a lot. An estimate off by even a couple of days significantly raises the percentage of women regarded as post-term (past 42 weeks) , who are then urged to have inductions.  Consider the results of a UK study of over 24,000 women . The researchers studied inductions for post-term (past 42 week) pregnancies. When evaluated by ultrasound dates alone, they found the majority, 71.5% percent, of these pregnancies were not actually post-term.  So when are pregnant women actually most likely to deliver?  In her book Expecting Better , Emily Oster used the 2006 annual U.S. data for singleton births, from the Centers for Disease Control, to try to answer this question. She noted that in 2006 the most common week to deliver in was the 39th; about 30% of births occurred then. The data from 2012 look similar to those from 2006, but hint: there’s a problem with her approach.  What’s the problem? These data are fine for figuring out when a pregnant woman is most likely to deliver, assuming she is agnostic about how she delivers. But they are not particularly useful for figuring out when spontaneous labor is most likely. This is because the CDC birth data includes all deliveries. The CDC combines spontaneous births with scheduled inductions and c-sections, and these are typically scheduled for the 39th week of pregnancy.  Are there really enough scheduled inductions and c-sections to affect the distribution of births for the whole U.S.? Absolutely. Since 1990, the rate of medical inductions has more than doubled . In 2012, more than 1 in 5 pregnant women were induced, compared to just under 1 in 10 in 1990 . In 2012, 32.9% of women had c-sections, a 60% increase from 1996, and about half of these c-sections were scheduled.  To see how big the effect is, compare the CDC’s singleton birth data for 2012 with the same data from 1990:   Scheduled inductions and c-sections shift the bulk of the distribution to the left. In 1990, slightly more women delivered in their 40th week of pregnancy than in their 39th week, and about 10% made it to their 42nd week. In 2012, most women delivered in their 39th week, and only 5% delivered in their 42nd week.  This comparison is not perfect. In 1990, scheduled inductions and c-sections were commonplace, albeit less frequent than in 2012. Still, the 1990 data are closer to what would occur without medical intervention and are consistent with other historical data. A large Swedish study of births found that 10% of women go past 42 weeks . The distribution of births in Canada in 1972 and 1986 shows a similar pattern:   Now that I am full term, how likely is it that I will deliver in the next week?  As a full-term pregnant woman, the above graph did not address my central question: when was someone like me most likely go into labor? Predicting this using the average delivery day, while a superior approach to using the due date, is still suboptimal. This is because the distribution of births is skewed . In 2012, preterm births accounted for just under 12% of all U.S. births. These preterm births create a long tail that pulls the average delivery date to the left.  Moreover, by 37 weeks, I knew I was not going to deliver in my 35th week. It would be nice to update my delivery estimate with that knowledge. Boiled down to a simple question, what I wanted to know was: How likely am I to go into labor within the next week, considering that I have not yet given birth? Statisticians would call this the conditional probability of giving birth in a given week.  For the sake of comparison, the table below shows the conditional probabilities for 1990 and 2012.   *Note: the CDC data combine week 37-38 deliveries. The probabilities shown for week 37 are therefore for delivery over the next two weeks .  Until past the 40-week mark, the odds of labor in the next week are less than 50%.  Because it is standard medical practice to induce labor at 42 completed weeks, the chance of delivery by 42 weeks appears to be 100%. Of course, many of these births are not spontaneous, but induced. From historical data, it appears that without medical intervention 5-10% of women would deliver after 42 weeks.  Like this post? Don’t forget, sharing is sweet!

Next Post Inducing Labor Past 39 Weeks Does Not Increase Your Chances of Having a C-Section     16 thoughts on “Your Due Date Is Wrong–So When Is Labor Most Likely?”        Rhea Marie  says:     October 1, 2014 at 10:47 pm      I love this topic.  Fortunately my OB was really relaxed about the due date, but I always feel bad for women who start to feel a lot of pressure to be induced when there isn’t an obvious reason to (like an ultrasound indicating there is potential for fetal distress/macrosomia/problems with amniotic fluid).  I had two due dates, May 4th, 2013 based on an ultrasound at 6 weeks and May 8th based on LMP.  I had the sweep on May 9th (after having an ultrasound where everything looked healthy– but the baby was definitely estimated to be over 9 lbs) and went into labor right away, and delivered May 11th (just past midnight); so about a week past my U/S due date and a few days past my LMP one.  Oh, and this reminded me of this site: http://spacefem.com/pregnant/charts/duedate0.php  Like Like   Reply         amykiefer2014  says:     October 21, 2014 at 6:23 pm      Nice that your doctor was relaxed and respectful of your wishes!  Did you baby end up over 9 lbs at birth? It sounds like weight estimation using ultrasounds can be pretty inaccurate.

I think the accuracy probably depends a lot on the experience of the technician and quality of the machine.

If it is say, a week away, then having an induction lowers the risk of a c-section.  After reading through all the research on this, the one take home message seems to be that after 41 weeks, having an induction is not going to raise your chances of a c-section; it will almost certainly lower it.  Like Like   Reply         Squique  says:     July 27, 2016 at 9:23 pm      Could you do (or have you already done) a review of the data on inducing labor in “elderly women” to prevent stillbirths? I am 41 years old and pregnant with my 4th child. I know the apparent standard practice is to induce at 39 weeks based on data from small study where is it suggested that stillbirth risk is that of younger women at that time. I’m vehemently opposed to the idea. I have had one experience with oxytocin after 2 completely unmedicated births and it was human torture. I am a physician in a non-OB field. In my perfunctory review of some data, I think there is excessive medicalization and intervention in birthing. Thank you.

For example: my son (healthy, normal pregnancy) came three weeks before his “due date.” So early no matter how you look at it really. What are my chances of having another early baby – are they increased at all? (Assuming another healthy pregancy, of course).

I wonder whether in Asian / African countries the standard calculation is also different, to reflect the earlier delivery cited in the study you linked to above?  (Also, since that study was based in London, sampling women of African or Asian *descent*, I wonder whether there’s a difference between African / Asian women actually in African / Asian countries and those in Caucasian-majority countries?)

Like Like   Reply         RH  says:     September 8, 2017 at 2:30 pm      I’m the exception to the rule not to count on the due date being the delivery date.  My two vaginal births occurred on their due dates.  with #1, my water broke the day before my due date and I was induced the next morning and delivered in the evening.  With #3, I went into natural labor at home in the morning at about 9 am, arrived at the hospital at 6cm at about 1 p.m and delivered at the hospital at 2:46 (weirdly enough on the operating table as they were preparing to put me out for an emergency c-section due to fetal distress when I said “the baby is coming” and then checked and then told me to push, it turned out he had a true knot in his umbilical cord and the cord was wrapped twice around his neck).  I know with my first pregnancy that I had a standard 25 day cycle and ovulated on day ten, with a positive pregnancy test 10 days later, so if the doctor had gone by those dates, my son would have been late under Naegele’s rule.  With #3 I ovulated around day 13, so had a more typical cycle length.

The third was a csection around her due date, and she weighed 6 – 3 and they said she looked three or four weeks early. Go figure. My first grandchild is due tomorrow (son of the son who was 26 days late), but who knows!  Like Like   Reply     Pingback: Pregnancy – Love. Laughter. Life. Medicine.         Vanessa  says:     February 9, 2018 at 10:26 pm      What a great article. I needed this ammunition in order to sound informed as my doctor wants to induce me at 41 weeks. I’m considering it since there are risks such as meconium etc. However I’d rather base it on evidence and if my fluid levels and stress tests are normal I see no reason to wait until 42 weeks. My mom had both my sister and I “late” so there is that genetic factor.  My blood pressure has been rising a bit albeit still normal, so I just have to control that by exercising daily and a good diet.

I had bronchitis, so I had been coughing really hard, but I don't think that could cause that so early... :)  Most first time moms go to term or later, though, I think.

This is my 3rd baby, and my first two came early. Baby #1 was born at 36 weeks 6lbs 12oz, and baby #2 was born at 38 weeks 7lbs 14oz. So I was trying to make labor predictions for myself, and seeing that I had my other babies early, was wondering if anyone delivered their previous children early, but then went all the way to their due date or overdue with their 3rd or subsequent pregnancies.       --  Ashley - married to my love for over a decade SAHM to DS12, DS10, & DD7, 👼🏾👼🏾👼🏾 TTC #4        See all comments from original poster (7)  Hide all comments from original poster (7)      Load more                    Report this post        1          Comments (34)        / 4                   anta#1    Last edited 02/02/2010      I am not sure I havent hit baby number three yet. But I heard that the third child could be sneaky some come out sooner then other. But due to your history I dont think you will go to 39 weeks so I would sit back relax because your labors come quick and you dont have a history of being overdue.

My first was about 1 week early and I was induced with my 2nd at 37 wk 5d, with PIH. This time, all the troubles are much worse and started much earlier. I'm wondering if #3 will be earlier or not...most likely though. I was also trying to convince myself not to assume my labor will be just as easy! With #2, it was soooo fast!

They told me they'd like me to hit at least 38w this time, but they think I'll get pre-eclampsia again at the same or earlier time.  The worst part is it's another c-section and the hospital won't allow the Dr. to book the operating room any earlier than 4 weeks prior to anyone's due date, and then the c/s has to be scheduled no earlier than someone's 39th week.  So with me, I have to wait until 8/1 to get my c/s date which will be some where between 8/22 and 8/29, but my own Dr. thinks I'll actually be having the baby somewhere around 8/10 if things work out the same way -- and there's no way I can plan for that.  They just seem to unintentionally make us nuts.

So far no signs of anything happening which is great.

The Odds of Baby Arriving on Their Due Date?           Without a doubt, you’ve heard lots of conflicting information on what a due date actually is.  Most believe the due date is a deadline. If Baby doesn’t arrive on that date, she’s late. If Baby comes before then, she’s automatically “premature.”        Some have theorized that due dates are an invention of modern medicine, and have become an excuse for doctors to perform c-sections. While that’s not what we believe, we do know that due dates are often inaccurate .  Baby should not be expected to arrive on an exact day (unless you’ve scheduled a c-section).  In fact, Baby should not be rushed at all unless there’s a medical reason to do so. According to the March of Dimes , a non-profit that “works to end premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality:”  “Labor should be induced only for medical reasons to protect the health of you and your baby. If your pregnancy is healthy, it’s best to let labor begin on its own without inducing labor.” // MarchofDimes.org  Due Date Statistics  Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants. You can also take the       Due Date Statistics Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants. You can also take the Note: The survey results were not verified. They rely on the honesty and accuracy of online participants. You can also take the survey here at SpaceFem.com.   What is the probability of spontaneous labor after 35 weeks?   Out of 11,1114 women, 8,464 went into labor spontaneously. This equals 76% of the total participants.   What is the probability of giving birth within X days of your due date?   Do babies come on their due dates? Not really, but they usually come sometime around it. Only 4.3% of babies arrived on their due date. Comparatively, 61.6% of non-induced babies arrive within one week of their due date.       What is the average length of pregnancy in weeks?    31.8% of babies were born at 40 weeks  25.7%  were born at 39 weeks  16.1% of babies were born at 41 weeks  13.5% were born at 38 weeks  6.4% were born at 37 weeks  2.8% were born at 36 weeks  2.1 % were born at 42 weeks  1.5% were born at 35 weeks  0.1% were born at 43 weeks.    What is the average length of pregnancy for subsequent births?   If your first baby comes early, will your second baby be early, too? If your second baby arrives late, does that mean your third will come late as well? According to the survey, on average, subsequent babies arrive 0.18 days later than the previous baby.  The average baby #2 came 0.44 days later than baby #1, based on 900 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.73 days earlier than baby #2, based on 187 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.58 days earlier than baby #1, based on 184 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.92 days earlier than baby #3, based on 50 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.19 days earlier than baby #2, based on 47 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.38 days earlier than baby #1, based on 48 mothers.    What is the length of pregnancy for first-time moms compared to second- and third-time moms?   On average, a first-time mom has her baby at 39 weeks 5 days. This is the equivalent of 54.8% of first-time moms giving birth on or before their due date compared to 56.7% of second-time moms, and 59.5% of third-time mothers.   Is there a connection between length of pregnancy and the type of delivery?    9% of the 8,670 women who went into labor spontaneously underwent a c-section.  19% of 2,343 women who were induced underwent a c-section.  Is there a correlation between induction and increased incidence of cesarean? You decide.   What is the relationship between the length of pregnancy and birth weight?   Are “late” babies huge? On average, “late” babies are generally bigger than “early” ones but not by much. The difference between a baby born at 39 weeks and one born at 41 weeks is about 300 grams.   What is the probability of induction after the due date?   Most doctors will induce a mom rather than let her get past her due date. According to the March of Dimes, however: “If your health care provider talks to you about inducing labor, ask if you can wait until at least 39 weeks to be induced. This gives your baby’s lungs and brain the time they need to fully grow and develop before he’s born.” // MarchofDimes.org   Is there a correlation between the age of the mother and the probability of spontaneous labor?   It has been theorized that the age of the mother has something to do with when labor sets in. Is it possible that the average due date would change depending on ethnicity, age or even country of origin? According to the survey, about the same number of women give birth on day 279 as 287.   Are more babies born on a full moon?   There is no correlation between the phase of the moon and when babies are born.   What is the most common day of the week for babies to be born?   According to the survey, the most common day for babies to be born is Thursday while the least common is Saturday.  Sunday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries and 1.6% induced births.  Monday 11% spontaneous deliveries and 3.2% induced births.  Tuesday 10.7% spontaneous deliveries 4.1% induced births.  Wednesday 10.9% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Thursday 13.1% spontaneous deliveries 4.5% induced births.  Friday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Saturday 10% spontaneous deliveries 2.3 % induced births.    What does it mean if I’m 40 weeks pregnant?   Congratulations! You’ve hit your due date and Baby is fully developed! Instead of stressing out that Baby’s not here yet, relax and enjoy the anticipation. 52% of the women surveyed were still pregnant at 40 weeks. 28.79% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 3 days (on or before 40W,3D). It’s normal to still be pregnant at this point. If your doctor or midwife is supportive of natural induction, consider these natural induction methods .  34.49% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 4 days (on or before 40W, 4D)  46.57% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 6 days (on or before 40W, 6D)  57.07% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 8 days (on or before 41W, 1D)  68.61% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 12 days (on or before 41W, 5D)  73.44% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 21 days (on or before 43W, 0D)  26.56% of babies were induced.    I know the exact date I conceived. Can I calculate my exact due date?   Typically, due dates have an 8- to 10-day variation as they are calculated from the last menstrual period, not date of conception. The question then arises, is it possible to calculate an exact due date based on conception date? According to the survey, the standard deviation does not improve even if you know the exact second your baby was conceived. Babies are individuals, just like adults. Some need more time in the womb than others.   Which babies are born earlier, boys or girls?   The average arrival time for babies of both sexes  is 39 weeks and 5 days.   Do inductions bias due date  statistics?   What if all the women who were induced were meant to give birth late? Doesn’t this change the average amount of time a pregnancy should last? Not really, according to the survey. If we assume each induction was actually a late birth, the average median would shift by 2 days.     First Published at www.spacefem.com.

Even though 37 weeks is still considered full term, studies show that babies born even a few weeks too early are at greater risk for health problems than those who are born later.

Photo Researchers      In her living room, Caroline Nagy introduces the newest member of her family — the 6-week-old infant in a striped onesie cradled in her arms. "This is Alex Joseph. He was born May 24th — my birthday," she says.  Their shared birthday wasn't entirely a coincidence. Two weeks before her due date, Nagy was swollen, and uncomfortable. So she asked her doctor for relief.  "I was just miserable. It was like uncomfortable to walk; I couldn't sit on the floor and play; I felt like I was neglecting my first kid because I just couldn't move and I couldn't do anything," says Nagy. "So I asked, 'Is there any way I can speed this up and have a baby earlier?' "  For Jackie McGinty, it wasn't discomfort but timing that caused her to schedule her daughter's birth by C-section eight years ago. McGinty's first child was delivered by C-section for medical reasons, and although this time around she had hoped to deliver naturally, she had just moved out of state and wanted her family nearby to help with the baby.  "My mom was coming out and she was only going to come out for a few weeks. I needed her to be there after the birth. ... So having the option to schedule it was good for us," says McGinty.     Harm In Planning Too Far Ahead?  Stories like these are common. Statistics show that from 1990 to 2006 the percentage of women who induced labor more than doubled, and nearly a third of women were having cesareans.      Enlarge this image       Caroline Nagy and her now 8-week-old infant in Youngstown, Ohio.

Gretchen Cuda Kroen for NPR  hide caption    toggle caption   Gretchen Cuda Kroen for NPR          Caroline Nagy and her now 8-week-old infant in Youngstown, Ohio. Nagy says she had labor induced early at 39 weeks because she was uncomfortable and felt as though she was neglecting her other child.  Gretchen Cuda Kroen for NPR     The increase wasn't because of emergencies, says Jay Iams, a specialist in maternal fetal medicine at Ohio State University, but rather because women and doctors began scheduling deliveries for convenience — "convenience for the mother, for the family, for the physician," says Iams. Sometimes, Iams says, it's because patients say to themselves, " 'I want only my doctor to be there. I don't want the person who's on call.' "  Having a baby naturally requires lots of planning.  But when it comes to the arrival date of your bundle of joy, experts now say that planning too far ahead can do more harm than good.  A full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, but elective deliveries are often planned for two or three weeks earlier. And even though 37 weeks is also still considered full term, studies show that babies born even a few weeks too early are at greater risk for health problems than those who are born later. That has some doctors campaigning to curb the trend of scheduled labor and delivery.  Pediatrician Ed Donovan of Cincinnati Children's Hospital says data collected over the past several decades show those babies have an increased risk of complications compared with waiting until the mother goes into labor spontaneously.  "It's now really well-documented in national studies that the risk of the baby having to require intensive care in a neonatal intensive care unit — even the risk of infant death — is increased when the baby is born as little as two weeks before the due date," says Donovan.  Organ Systems Maturing At Different Rates  The reasons for this are two-fold. First, without an ultrasound measurement in the first trimester, a woman's due date could be as much as two weeks off, making the fetus 35 weeks instead of 37.  And second, Donovan says the brain, heart, lungs, and immune system all mature at different rates — and some may need a little more time than others.  "Just because the lungs are mature doesn't mean that the other organ systems are mature," says Donovan.  "A baby born three weeks early with mature lungs may not be ready to eat because the brain's not fully developed."  According to Donovan, doctors realized they simply weren't very good at determining which babies were ready and which weren't. And Iams says the large numbers of sick babies made many doctors begin to think differently about early deliveries.         A baby's brain still has a lot of growing to do between 35 and 39 weeks in the womb.  Courtesy of March of Dimes   hide caption    toggle caption    Courtesy of March of Dimes     "Thirty-seven weeks is term, but they became the most common occupants of neonatal intensive care nurseries," says Iams. "And the pediatricians naturally said, 'They could have waited.' "  Still, many women and even many obstetricians remained unaware of the risks because it didn't fit with their experience.  "People see their friends having babies early, and sometimes women go into labor on their own at 37, 38 weeks — and that's not unusual and those babies are fine," says Jennifer Bailit, an obstetrician at Metro Health Medical Center in Cleveland. "But those are babies that have told us that they're coming and that they're ready."  Convincing Mothers It's Worth The Wait  Bailit is part of an effort led by Iams and Donovan to reduce the number of scheduled deliveries before 39 weeks across the state of Ohio.  Bailit says that she often has to explain to women the importance of those last few weeks — and that the discomfort is normal but something that needs to be endured for the sake of the baby.  "It's tough to be pregnant, and sometimes when you're in the moment it's hard to keep the big picture in mind," Bailit says. "When we guide people toward that kind of thinking it really helps them say, 'I'm doing this for my baby; it's worth it.' "  In addition to helping doctors like Bailit educate pregnant women, Iams and Donavan asked doctors at the 20 largest hospitals in the state to document a medical reason every time a woman was scheduled to deliver before 39 weeks. And much to their surprise, Iams says in under 15 months the rates of those deliveries dropped from 15 percent to under 5 percent. And more important, the number of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care also decreased.

The March of Dimes has taken what began in Ohio and a few other select states and extended it nationwide in a campaign it's calling "Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait." Alan Fleischman of the March of Dimes says the rate of elective births in the hospitals the organization has surveyed is about 30 percent.  "Most hospital leaders don't believe they have this problem until they actually measure it," says Fleischman. "And when they do, they're surprised."  As in Ohio, their preliminary data show that in only a short period of time, even hospitals with very high rates of scheduled deliveries are able to reduce them to about 5 percent or less by making a few simple changes — and in turn, increase the likelihood of a healthy baby.  Although inductions at 39 weeks and beyond are considered safe, some doctors feel that unless there is a medical reason to deliver early, the best labor plan for women is an old-fashioned one: Hang in there and wait until labor starts on its own.

I know that I was pretty concerned about it because both my husband and I were preemies and I just figured it was a risk. Plus I had been having a lot of braxton hicks. She checked me on Wednesday, though, and I wasn'tÂ dilatedÂ or anything. I'm 35 weeks now and she said that my little girl probably won't come early.Â From what I've heard, most first timers take longer. =) Good for those three days your DH will be out of town, but annoying as heck when we're past our due dates. lol k  katiemccarthy @chi_girl79  I am in the exact same situation. My DH is out of state on the 10th to the 13th. I am 37 weeks on the 15th. The whole thought makes me a little nervous because I am all alone here with no family. We live on Alabama and all family is in Canada. We are planning on him going.. But is going to be prepared to leave at the drop of a hat. And if anything does happen hopefully labour will be long enough. I know I am not providing any advice, but hopeing you are taking some comfort in tha fact that you arenot alone! : ) a  abdragonfly I think their could be a good chance because that's considered full-term. It depends on i'd you have someone else for L M  MidWestMomMN @chi_girl79  My first came at 37 weeks 3 days m  mamadasilvaXs3 @chi_girl79  It's not super common, but it has happened.  My sisters first LO made his appearance at 37 weeks, but my first LO wasnt here until 39 weeks 5 days. n  nycbabybump @chi_girl79  I agree with the pp. Ask your doc. I delivered my dd at 36 weeks so I know early is possible. Bc of that, we've had two recent internal sonograms to measure cervix length (they say is you're longer than 2.5 you're prob not going soon). Ask if they'd be willing to do this for your piece of mind at your next appt. I don't see why they wouldn't. But if you're not having any warning signs it should be ok. Most people have some sort of labor symptoms for a few days before full blown labor anyway. So do some digging and he on the lookout. Good luck! E  ElleBelles10 @chi_girl79  Well I'm a worry wart so I would probably wouldn't let my husband go!  haha  Just like you said....Murphy's Law.  You know if he goes you'd be more likely go into labor and if he stayed home you wouldn't.  I'd ask my doc and see what s/he says. If you went into labor, do you have someone else as a support person?  Or would he be able to leave the conference early?  If he goes, I would definitely have a back-up plan just in case.

I know she'll come when she's ready :) it's just a waiting game lol. I think we should get an idea when the doctor checks our cervix and see if it's softening or if we are dilated. I know my doctor is going to check around 36 weeks. A  AJPsMommy @kreneealvarez  That's a great point, that's probably the best indicator! I just wish I knew exactly when he's coming haha. I feel a ton of movements super low, it's crazy! He's locked and loaded so now I'm nervous lol. f  forthischild2015 @AJPsMommy  Most first time moms will go to their due date or over. With our DD we had the most exact due date you can have since we did IVF and she came 3 days past my due date. My sister was 4 days past her due date with her first and 2 days before her due date with her second. There's no telling, babies just come when they come! s  selaynar1 i did my own math & everyone else did their bets lol. i believe i will go into labor at 38weeks (FTM) but my boyfriend says ill go into labor at 37 weeks sometime in the afternoon, my godfather says 37.5weeks & so on & on lol . All i know is my little peanut needs to stay until 38+ weeks e  empiel I think statistically for first time moms, you are more likely to go 40+ weeks than to go early. That being said, my first came at 38 weeks, and my second at 38.5 weeks, both weighed the same. I agree that a cervical check is probably the best indicator. My doc checked me with my first at a regular appointment, and told me I would likely have the baby within the next 24 hours, and I had him 7 hours later. b  brielise15 The average for a first time mom is 41 weeks, 1 day... but obviously some moms go much earlier - usually any later and they'll want to induce (if not before that). I think it's really hard to make any predictions. I've had a few people tell me stories of going to the dr to get checked, having the dr tell them they won't deliver anytime soon, and then going into labor later that day. I also just had a friend tell me her dr said that she would deliver early and she ended up going right up to her due date. There's really no telling. My baby has been super low with a lot of pressure, head down, all through my pregnancy but that doesn't mean I'll be early!!! L  LyssahBlue Just found a calculator that will tell you probability based on your due date.  Wish I could find one that took other factors into consideration, like age and activity level! http://spacefem.com/pregnant/due.php?use=EDD&m=11&d=15&y=15 M  Munkeroo Most likely to go overdue. That said I delivered my first at 36w 6 days. So who knows when this one will come. I'd like her to stay in a little longer than #1 but if I go overdue I might go crazy being pregnant 5+ weeks longer! Cervical checks really tell you nothing. You can be hard and closed and go into labour that night or you can walk around 3cm dilated for a month! y  yellowsprout Yeah, cervical checks don't tell you much. You can be dilated for many many weeks. Or not at all and go into labor that same day. I was dilated "a fingertip" when I went into active labor. Took hours and hours of labor for me to even dilate to a two. Everyone is different! Most first-time moms make it to their due date... Just speaking from personal experience, plenty of moms I know had their baby at 39ish weeks, but few before that. That being said, if you're not sure about when you conceived, your due date could definitely be off by a few days to a week or so. So "early" would really be on time. I did IUI with my daughter, so I know exactly when I conceived and that I delivered her 6 days past my due date. m  mosoria My daughter came at 39 weeks and my son at 37 . Just be ready baby can come any time after 37 weeks you just dont know m  mrsteague9311 Everyone is different. It all depends on your pregnancy. But typically first time moms are usually on time or a little after. They come when they are ready :) L  LeighRogers @AJPsMommy  I'm due 11/12 but when I go back on the 25th we're going to schedule the induction date. My dr. said somewhere between 38-39 weeks unless she comes early on her own. Personally, I think my due date is little off anyways and my dr. Said she's already down. t  theone914 My first was 37wks and we'll see about when this one comes. I'm learning from last time and planning on having things packed and ready to go starting this weekend (31wks). We were a little caught off guard last time. Lol. We were gonna pack that weekend and my water broke on Friday. Poor hubs had to come home and do laundry because he had no clean socks ;) e  elizabeth283 @AJPsMommy  Most ftms go over their due date. I know so many people that were convinced they would go early around 37 weeks. Think about how miserable it would be to be 41 weeks and still no baby after you convinced yourself you would have baby 4 weeks earlier! It doesn't hurt to have bags packed just in case. Cervical checks are not a good indication either. You can be dilated for 6 weeks and another totally closed up and either could go into labor first. I  ILoatheCailou Dilation and cervix softening doesn't really tell you anything. I walked around at 3 cm dilated for a week before going into labor. Statistically if you are a ftm you will go over your due date. I was early with both my kids (5days with the first, 10 with the second). Some indicators of labor include losing mucus plug, I  ILoatheCailou @ILoatheCailou  Sorry. My son hit send. Diarrhea, cramping, tightening of stomach area A  AJPsMommy Hmmm ok so I shouldn't put too much weight on the cervical checks either! I just need to get ready and stay ready for the day that he decides to show his little face :). j  jammers79 @AJPsMommy  3rd time mom here... Both my girls were 2 and 3 wks early..

Does anyone know how common this is vs going into labor naturally? I would prefer to go into labor at home and let it progress naturally until my contractions are close together before going to the hospital. I am afraid i will go ten days over and they will induce me which could mean days in the hospital before baby comes. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  30 Posts l  luanafp @shelloc25  Not sure what the statistics are. I went into labour with my first one naturally at 38w1d and had an easy 10 hour labour. I did take LOTS of raspberry leaf tablets from week 34 onwards, maybe that helped. Unfortunately this time im scheduled for a c-section for medical reasons. m  mine27 @shelloc25  I'd heard alot of FTM going over too and was anxious about it but i went naturally at 37+6 with my first. t  tessadragon It really varies. Sis in law went into labor of her own accord: waters broke and she was told to go into hospital as waters breaking puts at risk of infection. If contractions had started without waters breaking, as long as you clear it with doctor you can wait longer before going in to hospital. First time babies can be early or can be late, not usually on time though. f  fournoggins I went into labor naturally on my due date with my first :) Even if you go over just trust your body and refuse an induction until it becomes medically necessary if that is what you want. m  melagasse I had my ob strip my membranes at my 40 week appt and I was having contractions before I got out of their building! Went to the hospital 6 hours later and had him about 8 hours after that. So not completely on my own but not induced. j  jill2778 The only baby that I had induced was #4. Weird in my opinion. :) m  mrsboisvenue With my first, I had a membrane sweep a little over 37.5 weeks at my doctors office and baby came a couple days later! Contractions started on there own and I stayed home until I was 5cm! I did this because I was very swollen and uncomfortable! Don't stress baby will get here one way or another! If you really want to wait it out express this to your doctor and see if they have any tips for bringing labor on at home b  babynayaka I think it depends on your ob/midwife. Mine let's you go two weeks over while my friends OB won't let you go more than a day over. That's really ridiculous if you consider that due dates are estimations and not an expiration date! I have long cycles and bet there are ladies in here with short cycles, conceived on the same day as me yet still have a due date after mine! 2  2girls1baby @shelloc25  You can go up to 2 weeks past your due date without being induced. n  nkappes13 I went into labor naturally with both my boys at 36 weeks. But I think they will give you a stress test when you get close and if baby is under a lot of stress and needs to come out, they will induce you. 1  1Queen1King3Princes With my first I went naturally at 35 weeks. r  rachelcap It's more likely to go over your due date with your first baby, but that doesn't mean you will need to be induced. You can choose to wait it out and monitor health of the baby. Some OBs will get nervous and push induction, though. Mine tried to pressure me into induction but I stood firm and waited to go into labor spontaneously at 42 weeks. I believe I could have ended up with a c-section if I had agreed to an induction so I'm glad I waited for my body to go into labor. m  michellenajarro With my first baby I went into labor naturally on her due date and she was born that same day. A  AWeaver2010 @shelloc25  I went into labor at 37 weeks naturally and my water broke on its own at home:) l  lalalaura88 @shelloc25  I just learned in my birth class that 41 weeks should be how long to expect, not the due date given at the hospital... So add 7 days to your due date. And your body will go into labor when it's ready. The only reason to induce is if your water breaks and labor hasn't started 24-48 hours after the water breaks because there would be a chance for infection:) J  J0607 You can go up to 42 weeks some obs get impatient and like to induce but honestly in my opinion it leads up to more complications, even c sections. There are lots of ways to naturally induce you just need to look it up. j  jennaemmerich @shelloc25  FTM here but my mom went naturally a week early with my brother and on my due date with me. b  beccavalerio My first had to be induced... she was almost 2 weeks late and wasn't showing any signs of wanting to vacate her comfy resting spot. I went to the hospital at 6am - had my labor induced and she was born by 4pm that afternoon - less than 12 hrs from start to finish!!! My water broke all on it's on for my second while I was getting my dogs ready for bed on a Sunday night. I didn't go to the hospital until the next morning AFTER I stopped off at Wal-Mart to grab a few things I forgot for my hospital bag. I was hoping that since my water broke all on it's own I wouldn't have to worry about an induction but no such luck. Things progressed so slow that by Monday evening they had to give me medication to move things along. She didn't arrive unit 3:30 am on Tuesday..... 36 hours of labor..... yuck. I'm hoping this one somewhere in between. :-) m  mamadeez @shelloc25  I have heard that FTM go over due date but haven't heard that most are induced. I went 2 days early with my first and 10 days late with my second. I haven't heard of anybody I know, needing to be induced with their first. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Your baby will come when they are ready and most likely go naturally. :) Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

It's planned for about 4 nights when I'm turning from 35 to 36 weeks. He would've planned it earlier, but timing in his and everyone else's schedule made that the only possible time. I guess my question is, do you know the chances of delivering that early? We looked online but couldn't find any hard data. This one site said only 3% so he feels better about his decision. I'm not so sure I like the idea. What do you think? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  17 Posts v  vanessamw @ftm_kristin  If this is your first baby and your dates seem sure I think you have nothing to worry about. My first one dropped at 36 weeks and I was 2 cm for a whole month!! First time moms rarely deliver early. Especially healthy non smoking ones. f  ftm_kristin Thanks. We are sure on the dates (had a dating ultrasound) so that makes me feel better :) J  Jewlz2121 @ftm_kristin  I wouldn't worry about him missing anything. I would just stay put yourself. l  lizjohnson1026 I delivered my dd 2 weeks early because there wasn't enough fluid left. A couple days before I delivered I thought my water broke and went to the hospital. After a couple hours they told me it didn't and sent me home. Then I went in for my follow-up from the hospital and told the doctor was she hadn't been moving much. They did an ultrasound and showed she only had 4 liters left and made to go to the hospital right away. They induced me and she was born the next day perfectly healthy. She is a happy 3 year old now! j  jenaandrob @Jewlz2121  my mom had me at just 37 weeks I was her first, I do not want to scare you but just giving you my moms reality, and my brother was at 38 weeks s  shaunal74 @ftm_kristin  With my first, my water broke at 36w1d. I had a lot of early labor signs the day before. If he is set on going, I would just be really intune to what you are feeling the few days before. f  freckle53 @ftm_kristin  I think the chances are small and would be the result of complications. My first was evicted at 41w5d. A  Artsymama3 @ftm_kristin  It's a pretty small number of women who go that early. I wouldn't worry, but have a plan in place in case it does happen, like who is going to bring you to the hospital. My boys were 2 weeks late and 6 days late. The reality is that most women are late or only a few days before there due date with their first. Second time is usually shorter. You just might want some help around the house because you'll be pretty tired by then. f  ftm_kristin Thanks for the replies, ladies. We're still in the "discussion" part of it, but I'm thinking he's probably going to go. Good idea about havibg a plan in place though. M  MommaMaki @ftm_kristin  My water broke with my first at 35w5d, and I had him within 13 hrs. Be in tune with your body. If you don't feel comfortable going, don't. Your baby will come when s/he wants to come and doesn't care about due dates. m  mamadimples @ftm_kristin  I delivered both of mine at 37 weeks and they came on their own (wasn't induced). a  amyjo1986 I don't want to scare you but you gotta know sometimes life just happens :( I had dd barely at 36wks and was a complete scare and lead to emergency c-section (I had a severe case of pancreatitis, mortality rate 1-5). I could've died if I wouldn't have had the care I had in the short time. I was young and healthy we would've never guessed in a million years it would've happened! L  Lauren_Sandoval I went into labor at 36 weeks. Everyone is different. Are kiddos just have a mind of there own :) k  kls91209 @ftm_kristin  I had my first baby at 36 weeks.  I had a perfect pregnancy...no complications.  Nothing was wrong with the baby...she just wanted to come out! Personally, I would tell your husband to book his trip a couple weeks earlier :) You never know!  v  vanessamw @amyjo1986  This is not the norm. Tell your husband to enjoy his trip. It may be his last for a while!!!! You are always going to hear the worst case scenarios and are not going to hear from the thousands of "normal" scenarios. g  germaphobemomma @ftm_kristin  My husband had to go on travel for work when I was 37 weeks with our first, and we were terrified since he would be on the opposite side of the country.  We asked the doctor, and she said there was almost no chance of me going into labor at that point.  It would be unusual.  I wound up having my daughter on her due date.  Everyone else I know went past their due date with their first.  Good luck!

I wasn't in active labor and they don't know why my water broke but it did. Just so you know he didn't have any health issues -he was just really skinny and had a little trouble with his breathing a couple of times in the fist 24 hours because during a vaginal birth the "gunk" in their lungs gets squeezed out but not during a c-section.. I'm hoping my water doesn't break before 37 weeks with this one. Except for medical reasons, I don't get why people are in such a hurry to get LOs out around now. I see posts about using castor oil, etc... to get labor started and I just don't get it at this point. I understand that we are all uncomfortable, etc... but I'm praying for a full term baby. Why are you having a c-section at 37 weeks? l  luvemi831 @CarrieKU  I agree. I think there is nothing wrong with having a c-section/ inducing for medical reasons, but choosing the deliver that early is a completely different matter. l  luvemi831 @opaquelace  You are having the c-section for medical reasons, not because you just don't feel like being pregnant anymore. There's a difference because it can't be helped. I am sure your babies will do great, this is more warning against people that are electing to give birth early. l  luvemi831 @opaquelace  You are having the c-section for medical reasons, not because you just don't feel like being pregnant anymore. There's a difference because it can't be helped. I am sure your babies will do great, this is more warning against people that are electing to give birth early. l  luvemi831 @faithg  It's good to hear your son was fine. I am sure it is not common for infants to have severe issues at 37 weeks, just more common than if they went full term (0bviously this is not the case if you go into labor naturally.) What really gets me is the posts like the one we had a few weeks ago where people say if they went into labor at 34/35 weeks they wouldn't want to call the doctor because the baby must "want" to be born. If at 37 weeks the chance for complications and death are increased, then at that early the chances are even more so. Why chance it? f  fitzmomma @luvemi831  I totally agree on waiting until term to induce if possible and let nature run it's course unless a medical reason says otherwise..  I would like to point out, however, that the study mentioned seems to rate all babies born at 37 weeks, not just those induced electively, so it would include babies that were induced due to problems or simply born early therefore skewing the mortality rates (obviously babies taken out early because they are already having issues are more likely to have problems than those who have had a normal pregnancies).  It would be interesting to just see the stats on elective inductions by themselves....  Still, I totally agree with the message of the article. T  Tinuviel42 I'm on medicine to stop preterm labor. I sure hope I can just suck it up for a few more weeks. If not, I guess that just makes me an *sshole. S  Sabbaticalsurprise @Tinuviel42  I think you read this post wrong... they're talking about people electively trying to get their bodies to go into labor earlier... If you're fighting preterm labor, this isnt about you. You have a valid medical complication that you are actively trying to keep your baby in for as long as possible. I am glad you've made it this far and are continuing. It's better for you and your baby. You're not just hot and bloated and looking to force yourself into having contractions. o  opaquelace @luvemi831  Oh definitely for medical reasons.  I wish I could be let to go into labor naturally, but at this point it doesn't even look like I'll make my c-section date at this point with my blood pressure spikes.  I definitely know people who have "disagreed" with my doctor, but they aren't doctors lol...so I don't listen. l  luvemi831 @Tinuviel42  I am having a c-section at 37 weeks due to medical reasons, and now my doctor is talking about 36 weeks. You are not choosing to go into labor, your body is doing it naturally and you are trying to do what you can to keep you lo as long as possible. People like you and I are not who they are referring to. l  luvemi831 @fitzmomma  That is an interesting point. I would think they would have taken that into account, but I guess you never know. Personally, unless my water broke, I would definitely prefer the baby stayed in as long as she needed. l  luvemi831 @opaquelace  Don't you love how everyone has their opinions.

Read on to find out when your baby will make his appearance. By Lauren Picker from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print 7 Must-Know Truths About Due Dates RELATED:  A New Test Can Predict Your Actual Due Date Bet on Unpredictability As a journalist who's accustomed to meeting deadlines, I wasn't surprised when, during my first pregnancy, I went into labor on my due date. The second time around was another matter. My due date came and went. And went, and went, and went. It wasn't until the day before my doctor planned to induce me—at nearly 42 weeks pregnant —that I finally went into labor. My experience brought home one of the essential truths of pregnancy: Your due date is anything but predictable. Still, your doctor needs to determine one that's as accurate as possible so that any necessary tests are done at the correct time. "And knowing how far along you are makes it easier for your obstetrician to see that your baby is growing properly," explains ob-gyn Joanne Stone, M.D., coauthor of Pregnancy for Dummies . RELATED: How You'll Know if You're in Labor Wondering when to expect your new arrival? Find out now. The Dating Game To calculate your due date , your doctor will take the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), and add 280 days (the equivalent of 40 weeks). For example, if your last period started on September 1, your due date would be June 7. This method assumes that your period arrives like clockwork every 28 days. If your cycles are longer, you're likely to deliver later than your due date; if they're shorter, expect to deliver earlier. A first-trimester sonogram is more trustworthy. Your doctor measures the length of the fetus and size of the gestational sac. If these numbers don't match up with what your LMP would predict, she may adjust your due date. But even if your doctor can pinpoint your due date with laserlike precision, don't expect your baby to show up right on schedule. Because, for all the windows into your womb, no one really understands what triggers labor. One possible (but, as my experience shows, imperfect) predictor: your past performance. "Patients tend to repeat what they did in a previous pregnancy," says Iffath Hoskins, M.D., executive director of the Women's Service at the Memorial Health University Medical Center, in Savannah, Georgia. If you're a first-time mom, look at your mother's childbirth history. "If your mother delivered one week past her due date, you are more apt to deliver one week past your due date as well," explains Fredric D. Frigoletto, Jr., M.D., chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Sooner Than Expected Most women—about 80 percent—deliver sometime between 37 and 42 weeks. So where does that leave the other 20 percent? About 11 percent deliver prematurely. Experts aren't sure why some women go into labor early. Possible risk factors include carrying multiples or having an abnormally shaped uterus. There may also be a connection between preterm labor and an infection such as bacterial vaginosis. Even your build can play a role—women who weigh less than 110 pounds are at slightly higher risk. Waiting It Out Once you've passed your due date, you may wonder whether your baby will arrive later than 42 weeks, or post-term. While Caucasian women tend to have slightly longer pregnancies, as do women under 30, no one knows why some babies take their own sweet time. However, your baby's gender could be a clue: One study found that boy fetuses are more likely to go beyond their due date than girls. Beginning at 40 or 41 weeks, expect to undergo weekly, then twice-weekly, nonstress tests. If your pregnancy progresses beyond this point, there's a risk that the quality of the placenta will deteriorate, the amniotic-fluid level will decline, or that your baby will pass a bowel movement, known as meconium. "Babies begin to practice breathing, and they can aspirate the meconium into their lungs—causing postdelivery problems," Dr. Frigoletto says. In addition, because your baby is still growing, you're at higher risk of needing a C-section . For these reasons, your doctor may want to induce labor once you hit 42 weeks. Whether you give birth exactly on your due date—or in the weeks before or after—doesn't really matter in the long run. After all, you'll just be happy to meet your newborn whenever she arrives.

If you consider 4 weeks (28 days) a month, then there are 36 weeks in 9 months. If you consider a month 30-31 days, then there are closer to 40 weeks in 9 months.                 hoping+praying    Answered 1/17/08               5 found this helpful     yes 36 weeks is 9 months and when u turn 40 weeks your actually 10 months                 ladorothy_is_mom    Answered 12/22/08               5 found this helpful     36 weeks equals 9 lunar months. 40 weeks equals 10 lunar months. Since not all months have the same number of days, the doc's calculate gestation by weeks-more accurate. So, you are in fact pregnant for 9 calendar months/10 lunar months.                 Kalyber02    Answered 7/8/10               5 found this helpful     You are not pregnant for 10 months. There are 30-31 days in a month not 28 and you are not actually pregnant for the first 2 weeks. Your due date is calculated by the first day of your last period but your conception date is not until about two weeks after that.                 francobaby1    Answered 12/14/10               5 found this helpful     Paint thinner was accidentally spilled in my house.

Pregnancy   How Accurate are Due Dates?                     by Shannon Philpott Apr 01, 2014      Photograph by Getty Images/PhotoAlto The anticipation of knowing exactly when your baby will be born is exciting. When a physician determines your due date, however, it's not always a guarantee of the day your child will be born. Due dates are determined based on a number of factors, including your menstrual cycles and the baby's measurements, which can predict your baby's expected date of delivery within a week or two. RELATED: Dr. Drai Evaluating Your Cycles Due dates are accurate if you have regular monthly periods; obstetricians often calculate the due date based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, says Dr. Draion Burch, Pennsylvania-based obstetrician-gynecologist. However, women who have irregular periods can have inaccurate dates determined, he says. Burch recommends confirming due dates within the first trimester to improve the accuracy of the due date. Analyzing Baby's Size Due dates are also calculated based on the baby's body length during an ultrasound between eight and 12 weeks of pregnancy, according to Dr. Sachchidananda Maiti, England-based obstetrician and gynecologist. This method is more accurate than calculating through menstrual dates, he says, but it is not as good at dating your due date if you had assisted conception with fertility drugs and treatments. Doctors usually give women a range between 38 and 42 weeks of a pregnancy as the anticipated delivery time. Deciphering Accuracy Due dates are often referred to as estimated due dates because a woman's cycle and the baby's growth can vary, says Deena Blumenfeld, Pennsylvania-based Lamaze certified childbirth educator. "Only 5 percent of women give birth on their due dates, so we often tell moms that it is more like a due months," she says. Although premature delivery is possible, most women deliver between 37 and 42 weeks. Women aren't officially overdue until after 42 weeks of pregnancy, says Blumenfeld. RELATED: Shining Light Prenatal Education Measuring Baby's Growth Although your due date may be determined based on an ultrasound or your menstrual cycle, a margin of error with the date's accuracy is possible because of the baby's growth, says Blumenfeld. Babies grow and develop at different rates in the womb, just as they do on the outside, she says. "There is a range of normal for fetal development and that affects when labor begins," says Blumenfeld.

Why Is 40 Weeks so Important?  Your Baby is very important to you. Remember every week counts! Keep your baby inside until its time!  Near the end of your pregnancy you may be uncomfortable or anxious to see your baby. But remember -- you want to be sure you deliver a full term baby if possible.  How long is full term?  Pregnancy lasts for about 280 days or 40 weeks.  A preterm or premature baby is delivered before 37 weeks of your pregnancy.   Extremely preterm infants are born 23 through 28 weeks.  Moderately preterm infants are born between 29 and 33 weeks.  Late preterm infants are born between 34 and 37 weeks.   Babies born before 39 weeks gestation have a greater chance of breathing problems, low blood sugar and other problems that may result in being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. So be patient!  What causes preterm births?  There are many factors that may lead to a preterm birth. Women who have had a previous preterm baby are at highest risk for another preterm baby. Women carrying multiple babies (such as twins or triplets) or have uterine or cervical abnormalities (such as fibroid tumors in their uterus) are also at high risk.  Other factors that put you at risk for a preterm birth include:   Diabetes;  High blood pressure;  Blood clotting disorders;  Problems with the placenta or bleeding;  Overweight or underweight;  Short time between pregnancies;  Late or no prenatal care;  Smoking, drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs; and  Stress.   What are the risks of a preterm birth?  Having a baby before your due date puts the baby at higher risk for many health problems.  Babies born before 39 weeks gestation can have problems. Choosing to have your baby by induction , or C-section may seem convenient, but it puts both you and your baby at risk for problems.  The March of Dimes , a national organization whose mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality,recommends that inductions be performed only for the health of the mother or the baby.   March of Dimes   What are the problems with having a baby before my due date?  A baby's brain is the last major organ to develop during your pregnancy, so every day your baby stays inside your uterus is important for your baby! The part of the brain that the baby will use for thinking doubles in size during the last few weeks of your pregnancy. When you are 35 weeks pregnant, your baby's brain only weighs two-thirds of what it will weigh at 40 weeks.  Some of the health problems that preterm babies may have include:   Problems breathing and keeping warm;  Feeding problems because they may have more trouble sucking and swallowing;  Newborn jaundice, which causes their skin and the white part of their eyes to look yellow;  A longer hospital stay after they are born or be in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;  Are more often readmitted to the hospital with problems; and  A smaller and less developed brain when they are born.   Even if the baby does well when born, he or she may have more long-term health problems such as:   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); and  As adults, they are more likely to get diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.   I want my baby to be healthy as possible. What can I do?  Sometimes no matter what you do, you may have a preterm baby, but there are things you can do to help prevent it.   If you are just thinking about getting pregnant, then get as healthy as you can before you get pregnant.  Preconception Care: A Guide for Optimizing Outcomes      If you smoke, stop.

By Jennifer L. W. Fink from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Tetra Images/ Getty Images  Mel Grego's doctor agreed to induce her at 38 weeks so that her baby would share a birthday with his father and grandmother. The mom from Hudson, Wisconsin, believed the date would bring her good fortune during the delivery. However, that didn't turn out to be the case. Grego ended up having an unplanned cesarean section , and her son developed a mild case of jaundice after he was born—a complication that sometimes occurs when a baby is born early. In fact, experts now believe that you should do everything in your power to make it to your due date , unless there's a medical reason to deliver your child sooner. New research suggests that birthing a baby prior to 39 weeks puts him at higher risk for a range of health and developmental problems. "The evidence is so compelling that a growing number of American hospitals are launching programs to help prevent elective deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation," says Diane Ashton, M.D., deputy medical director of the March of Dimes. Learn more about the benefits of waiting from our experts. What "Term" Means Now For years, babies were considered term (what we often call full-term) between 37 and 41 weeks of pregnancy. Most physicians believed that major organ development was complete by 37 weeks and that babies simply packed on pounds during the last stretch of pregnancy. The latest research, however, has proved them wrong. "We now know that important organs, such as the lungs and the brain, are not fully developed until 39 weeks," says Jason K. Baxter, M.D., an ob-gyn who specializes in high-risk pregnancies at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, in Philadelphia. One study, for example, found that babies born by C-section before 39 weeks have more breathing difficulties than babies delivered by C-section after 39 weeks. Furthermore, babies delivered electively at 37 weeks are four times more likely to end up in the neonatal intensive care unit or have serious respiratory troubles than babies born at 39 weeks or later; babies who arrive at 38 weeks are twice as likely to have complications. As a result of these findings, experts now don't consider babies term until 39 weeks. Infants born during weeks 37 and 38 are considered early term. Why Those Last Weeks Matter You may be tempted to ask your doctor for an early induction because of swollen ankles or an aching back, but that final month is critical to your baby's good health. For starters, a compound in her lungs called surfactant, which enables her to breathe independently, continues to be produced in greater amounts during the last month of pregnancy and decreases her risk of developing breathing problems once she arrives. Her liver is still undergoing changes that will enable it to properly filter toxins, such as jaundice-causing bilirubin, out of her body. Her skin is thickening and she is accumulating more body fat, which will help her to maintain her own body temperature after she's born. Brain development is still underway; at 35 weeks, for example, its volume is only about two thirds of what you'd expect at 39 to 40 weeks, says Dr. Ashton. Additionally, important brain and nerve connections are being made to help her suck, swallow, breathe, regulate her body temperature, and even sleep better once she's born. How Sticking It Out Helps You Avoiding medical interventions and allowing your body to go into labor naturally has major benefits for you too. You're more likely to have a smoother birth, explains Kathleen Simpson, Ph.D., a clinical nurse specialist at Mercy Hospital, in St. Louis. According to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the average labor time for first-time moms undergoing a planned induction was 14.5 hours, compared with ten or 11 hours for first-timers who went into labor on their own. Artificially starting labor also increases your odds of having a C-section by 50 percent. In order to induce labor, medication is typically administered to soften the cervix and start contractions; a second drug, pitocin, can cause particularly intense contractions. If your cervix doesn't dilate all the way, or if your contractions aren't progressing, your doc will opt for a C-section. And while most C-sections today go off without a hitch, they're still considered major abdominal surgery. Furthermore, letting your baby arrive when he's ready increases your chances of being able to bond with him as soon as he's born, rather than having to wait to hold him until after he's out of intensive care. Compared with the joy of having that first cuddle with your baby, the discomfort of those last few weeks is something you'll soon forget.

Daily Probability Chart          About the Labor Predictor  Will you go into labor today? Tomorrow? Next week? The labor predictor estimates the odds of spontaneous labor on a given day based on where you are relative to your due date using statistical modeling.  Take the Probabilities With You  Wondering what the probability is of going into labor before your due date, or before your induction date? Want to bookmark the Labor Probability Calculator with all it's data so you don't have to keep re-entering your date info it day after day? Click here to get a parameterized URL.  About the Model Prior research has shown that the distribution of spontaneous labor approximates a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 9 [1]
  or 13 days [2].  These studies provide the initial building blocks for our model, but fail to paint a complete picture.    
  Neither distribution does a good job of estimating the number of preterm deliveries.  The CDC has found that 9.6% of babies are born prematurely , 
  before 37 weeks.  The normal distribution based on [1] and [2], however, would predict less than 3% of babies
  are born prematurely (.03% and 2.7% respectively).
  In fact,
  [1] specifically excluded preterm deliveries from their analysis which
  is why their model predicts so few preterm babies, which explains why it's model predicts so few of them.  The normal distribution is favored in these types of applications for it's simplicity and tendency to fit the data.
  In this case, however, the normal distribution is likely an over simplification.
  A key drawback is that the normal distribution is a symmetric distribution.  
  That means two points equally far from the mean will have the same probability.  A symmetric distribution that predicts 10% of babies
  will be born before 37 weeks will also predict 10% of babies will be born after 43 weeks.  For all the births prior to 30 weeks,
  there would be a similar number of births after 50 weeks.
  Additionally, in a symmetric distribution 
  the median (point
  which half of all women would have gone into labor), is equal to the mode (most common day to go into labor.)  In prior studies,
  however, the mode date is typically after the median [2]. Although not scientific, conventional wisdom is that the most
  common day to go into labor is around 41 weeks. Taken together,
these data points suggests that a skewed normal distribution might be more appropriate.
The skewed normal distribution is a family of distributions that includes
the normal distribution, however the skewed normal distribution need not be symmetric.  Where the normal distribution is
defined by two parameters
(mean and standard deviation), the skewed normal distribution is defined by three (location, shape and scale).  Using mean squared error we identified a skewed normal
distribution that closely approximates the normal distribution identified with prior research (MSE of 0.002), accounted
for 10% of spontaneous labors occurring prematurely, and predicted roughly half of all women would go into labor before 
their due date and half after.   [1] H. Kieler; O. Axelsson; S. Nilsson; U. Waldenströ (1995). "The length of human pregnancy as calculated by 
    ultrasonographic measurement of the fetal biparietal diameter". Ultrasound in Obstetrics &
    Gynecology. 6 (5): 353–357. doi:10.1046/j.1469-0705.1995.06050353.x  [2] Bergsjø P, Denman DW 3rd, Hoffman HJ, Meirik O. (1990). 
    "Duration of human singleton pregnancy. A population-based study.". Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand: 197–207.   Differences between Datayze's model and those found on other websites The key difference between our model and every other model out there (that we know of) is our model better
  incorporates
  the possibility of preterm spontaneous labor.  Like [1], most online models predict the probability of spontaneous labor
  before 37 weeks is approximately zero. As you can see
     
 from the Full Chart we estimate the probability of spontaneous labor before 37 weeks as 9.6%, matching the number from the CDC .
  If you're past 37 weeks, this distinction will be less important.  
  Before 37 weeks and our model will serve you much better.  Differences between Labor Probability Chart and the Labor Probability Calculator You may notice the probabilities differ between the Labor Probability Chart  and the Labor Probability Calculator .  That is because the two apps are modeling two similar sounding, yet different events.  
  This Labor Probability 
  Chart shows the probability of spontaneous 
  labor for a pregnant woman without considering how far along
  she is in her pregnancy.  
  The Labor Probability Calculator shows the probability of spontaneous based on how far along she is
  by renormalizing the distribution to include only the possible remaining days in a woman's pregnancy.
  After all, for a woman who hasn't gone into labor by today the probability of spontaneous labor starting yesterday is, by definition, 0%.
  Statistically speaking it's the difference between the probability of labor at 40 weeks 0 days in general, p _labor (40w0d) ,
  and the probability of labor at 40 weeks 0 days for a woman who is already 39 weeks along, p _labor (40w0d|39WeeksAlong) .  This website is intended for general information & entertainment purposes only.

Giving Birth Before Your Due Date: Do All 40 Weeks Matter?  New guidelines redefine "full-term pregnancy." Understand the impact that your delivery date can have on your baby's health. By Jeanne Faulkner, R.N.  Facebook  Pinterest  Text  Email     Motherhood Maternity  Your due date is in sight and you only have a few weeks to go. In fact, you're so close, you'd be happy to get the show on the road and have your baby now. What's the harm? Your doctor told you, after all, that at 37 weeks , you're close enough to your due date that its safe to have your baby. In fact, why not get your calendar out and book the date and make things easy? Why go through the last miserable couple weeks of pregnancy if you don't really have to? That's what countless women were told during the 80s, 90s and 2000s when the induction craze was at its peak. As it turns out, those last few weeks are just as important as any other phase of pregnancy , and "close enough" doesn't always cut it. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has redefined the meaning of "term pregnancy." Pregnancies used to be considered at term, and babies ready for delivery, any time after 37 weeks. If mom went past that, those last three weeks (or longer) were almost seen as a write-off. Now, however, after a couple of decades that have seen too many C-sections and record numbers of babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), those last few weeks of pregnancy are being taken seriously. That's why "term pregnancy" is now being broken down into distinct categories. Term Pregnancy: Categories - Early Term: Between 37 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days - Full Term: Between 39 weeks 0 days and 40 weeks 6 days - Late Term: Between 41 weeks 0 days and 41 weeks 6 days - Poster: Between 42 weeks 0 days and beyond Doctors and hospitals have learned so much from the mistakes made back in the day when inductions and C-sections were as easy to schedule as a haircut ,and were often done with mothers who were only 37 - 38 weeks pregnant . Many of these procedures were done not out of medical necessity, but for convenience sake--for example, to make sure grandma could be at the birth, or so mom could be sure her own doctor would be on-call during her labor. But because due dates are often miscalculated, especially by ultrasound, doctors were frequently delivering premature babies who wound up spending time in the NICU. And many of these inductions were unsuccessful because mom's body was not ready to go into labor. These women wound up with C-sections they most likely wouldn't have needed if they'd waited for labor to start on its own. Slowly but surely the birth culture of "induction or C-section on demand" has changed. Now, most doctors have received the memo that unnecessary inductions are potentially dangerous for moms and babies. If there are solid, compelling medical reasons to induce or schedule a C-section, then, by all means, that's what those procedures are there for. However, if the medical reason can wait until a baby is full term, mothers and babies both fare better. If there's no reason to induce or do surgery, then for heaven's sake–don't do it. That's why these guidelines were developed, because finally, FINALLY, the medical community understands that "close enough to the due date" isn't always good enough. Lots of essential "finish work" is done in the last few weeks of pregnancy and we're learning more every day about the negative consequences we're inflicting on babies when we cut short their time in the uterus. Another great thing about these guidelines is that it spells out that a woman isn't really "over due" when she goes past her due date a week or two. For a long time now, doctors have been fixed on that 40-week mark as if a timer will go off and all hell's going to break loose if the baby isn't born lickety-split. Their concern is about babies growing too big for mom's pelvis, or a placenta growing too old to sustain baby. While those things do occasionally happen, they don't happen very often. Since post due date pregnancies put doctors on the defense (legally speaking) however, the birth culture pressed hard for women to accept medical interventions to push them into labor once the buzzer went off. The thing is that prior to when all those crazy inductions took over the birth industry in the 80s and well into the 2000s, women delivered safely a week or two past their due dates all the time and it was no big deal. Sure, they were crazy uncomfortable and frustrated, but nobody considered that there was anything wrong with them. These new guidelines send the message that women and their doctors need to hear: So what if the baby's a little late? No biggie. He or she will come when really, truly ready to be born. Frankly, we think mom's body knows when that time is far better than anybody else. Jeanne Faulkner, R.N., lives in Portland, Oregon with her husband and five children. Got a question for Jeanne?

September 29, 2014  Amy Kiefer  16 Comments     Can we please stop with this due date nonsense already?  Yes, the due date is not a precise date , only an estimate. And yes,  most women will deliver within 2 weeks of their so called “due date”.  But the due date has bigger problems.   Actual birth data, from real pregnant women, shows that the due date is not only an imprecise delivery estimate–as any single day would be–it is 1-4 days too early . Statistically-speaking, it is biased. And bias is bad .  If you knew nothing about due dates, you might reasonably suppose that the due date is the average date of delivery.  And you’d be wrong. The due date is NOT the average delivery day of a large, modern reference sample of pregnant women. The due date is also NOT the day on which pregnant women most commonly deliver (the mode). It is NOT the day by which half of pregnant women have typically delivered, and half have not (the median). No, the average, the mode, and the median delivery days are all 1-4  days after the “due date “.  So why care about the due date at all? Well, modern medicine has given us one very concrete reason for concern: Due dates act as a medical deadline. Go a week past yours, and you will be urged to have labor induced. Go two weeks past and an induction is all but assured. If you have severe gestational diabetes, and your due date will likely be treated as a hard stop, and your doctor will insist on an induction at the 40 week mark.  So what IS a due date?  The “due date” comes from a calculation known as Naegele’s rule , in which 280 days are added to the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period.  Naegele’s rule has proved remarkably enduring. Naegele, a director at a German hospital, developed his rule in the early 1800s, long before ovulation predictor kits, over-the-counter pregnancy tests, prenatal ultrasounds, fetal nonstress tests, pitocin–in short, before all of modern obstetrics. His calculation of pregnancy length relied not only on the duration of actual, observable pregnancies, but was also greatly influenced by biblical scholarship indicating that the gestation of Christ lasted for ten lunar months .  Not surprisingly, Naegele’s rule has some problems. The first, imprecision , is pretty obvious to people with ovaries: His rule assumes menstrual cycles are consistent in length, exactly 28 days long, with ovulation occurring precisely on day 14. Ovulation is less predictable than that. And many, many women’s cycles are shorter or longer than 28 days. Have a longer cycle, and the due date will likely underestimate the real delivery date. Have a shorter cycle, and the due date may overestimate it.  The second problem, bias , is far more concerning:  The average actual delivery date is later than the one predicted by Naegele’s rule. This is especially true for first-time mothers. In a study of 114 Caucasian women , women with 1 or more deliveries under their belts delivered an average of 3 days after their due dates; first time mothers delivered an average of 8 days after their due dates. Another study of 1,514 women with reliable conceptions dates found that first-time mothers went an average of 4 days “late;” women with a previous birth went 2 days “late.”  Other large studies back up these findings: Naegele’s rule consistently underestimates the average delivery date by 2-4 days (see here ).  Note, though, that estimates apply best to Caucasian women. For unknown reasons, women of Asian or African ancestry tend to give birth about a full week earlier than do Caucasians .  Is there a more accurate way to calculate a “due date”?  Yes. One way is to shift Naegele’s rule. Adding 282 days to the first day of the last menstrual period, instead of 280, provides a more accurate estimate. But, if available, an estimate based on a first trimester ultrasound is the best option . Using ultrasound-based due dates, 92% of pregnancies delivered within the normal range of 37-42 weeks; using due dates, this percentage fell to 87%.  One day off. Two days off. Who really cares? Actually, this bias matters a lot. An estimate off by even a couple of days significantly raises the percentage of women regarded as post-term (past 42 weeks) , who are then urged to have inductions.  Consider the results of a UK study of over 24,000 women . The researchers studied inductions for post-term (past 42 week) pregnancies. When evaluated by ultrasound dates alone, they found the majority, 71.5% percent, of these pregnancies were not actually post-term.  So when are pregnant women actually most likely to deliver?  In her book Expecting Better , Emily Oster used the 2006 annual U.S. data for singleton births, from the Centers for Disease Control, to try to answer this question. She noted that in 2006 the most common week to deliver in was the 39th; about 30% of births occurred then. The data from 2012 look similar to those from 2006, but hint: there’s a problem with her approach.  What’s the problem? These data are fine for figuring out when a pregnant woman is most likely to deliver, assuming she is agnostic about how she delivers. But they are not particularly useful for figuring out when spontaneous labor is most likely. This is because the CDC birth data includes all deliveries. The CDC combines spontaneous births with scheduled inductions and c-sections, and these are typically scheduled for the 39th week of pregnancy.  Are there really enough scheduled inductions and c-sections to affect the distribution of births for the whole U.S.? Absolutely. Since 1990, the rate of medical inductions has more than doubled . In 2012, more than 1 in 5 pregnant women were induced, compared to just under 1 in 10 in 1990 . In 2012, 32.9% of women had c-sections, a 60% increase from 1996, and about half of these c-sections were scheduled.  To see how big the effect is, compare the CDC’s singleton birth data for 2012 with the same data from 1990:   Scheduled inductions and c-sections shift the bulk of the distribution to the left. In 1990, slightly more women delivered in their 40th week of pregnancy than in their 39th week, and about 10% made it to their 42nd week. In 2012, most women delivered in their 39th week, and only 5% delivered in their 42nd week.  This comparison is not perfect. In 1990, scheduled inductions and c-sections were commonplace, albeit less frequent than in 2012. Still, the 1990 data are closer to what would occur without medical intervention and are consistent with other historical data. A large Swedish study of births found that 10% of women go past 42 weeks . The distribution of births in Canada in 1972 and 1986 shows a similar pattern:   Now that I am full term, how likely is it that I will deliver in the next week?  As a full-term pregnant woman, the above graph did not address my central question: when was someone like me most likely go into labor? Predicting this using the average delivery day, while a superior approach to using the due date, is still suboptimal. This is because the distribution of births is skewed . In 2012, preterm births accounted for just under 12% of all U.S. births. These preterm births create a long tail that pulls the average delivery date to the left.  Moreover, by 37 weeks, I knew I was not going to deliver in my 35th week. It would be nice to update my delivery estimate with that knowledge. Boiled down to a simple question, what I wanted to know was: How likely am I to go into labor within the next week, considering that I have not yet given birth? Statisticians would call this the conditional probability of giving birth in a given week.  For the sake of comparison, the table below shows the conditional probabilities for 1990 and 2012.   *Note: the CDC data combine week 37-38 deliveries. The probabilities shown for week 37 are therefore for delivery over the next two weeks .  Until past the 40-week mark, the odds of labor in the next week are less than 50%.  Because it is standard medical practice to induce labor at 42 completed weeks, the chance of delivery by 42 weeks appears to be 100%. Of course, many of these births are not spontaneous, but induced. From historical data, it appears that without medical intervention 5-10% of women would deliver after 42 weeks.  Like this post? Don’t forget, sharing is sweet!

Fortunately my OB was really relaxed about the due date, but I always feel bad for women who start to feel a lot of pressure to be induced when there isn’t an obvious reason to (like an ultrasound indicating there is potential for fetal distress/macrosomia/problems with amniotic fluid).  I had two due dates, May 4th, 2013 based on an ultrasound at 6 weeks and May 8th based on LMP.  I had the sweep on May 9th (after having an ultrasound where everything looked healthy– but the baby was definitely estimated to be over 9 lbs) and went into labor right away, and delivered May 11th (just past midnight); so about a week past my U/S due date and a few days past my LMP one.

Did you baby end up over 9 lbs at birth? It sounds like weight estimation using ultrasounds can be pretty inaccurate.

If it is say, a week away, then having an induction lowers the risk of a c-section.  After reading through all the research on this, the one take home message seems to be that after 41 weeks, having an induction is not going to raise your chances of a c-section; it will almost certainly lower it.

I am 41 years old and pregnant with my 4th child. I know the apparent standard practice is to induce at 39 weeks based on data from small study where is it suggested that stillbirth risk is that of younger women at that time. I’m vehemently opposed to the idea. I have had one experience with oxytocin after 2 completely unmedicated births and it was human torture. I am a physician in a non-OB field. In my perfunctory review of some data, I think there is excessive medicalization and intervention in birthing. Thank you.

For example: my son (healthy, normal pregnancy) came three weeks before his “due date.” So early no matter how you look at it really. What are my chances of having another early baby – are they increased at all? (Assuming another healthy pregancy, of course).

I wonder whether in Asian / African countries the standard calculation is also different, to reflect the earlier delivery cited in the study you linked to above?  (Also, since that study was based in London, sampling women of African or Asian *descent*, I wonder whether there’s a difference between African / Asian women actually in African / Asian countries and those in Caucasian-majority countries?)

My two vaginal births occurred on their due dates.  with #1, my water broke the day before my due date and I was induced the next morning and delivered in the evening.  With #3, I went into natural labor at home in the morning at about 9 am, arrived at the hospital at 6cm at about 1 p.m and delivered at the hospital at 2:46 (weirdly enough on the operating table as they were preparing to put me out for an emergency c-section due to fetal distress when I said “the baby is coming” and then checked and then told me to push, it turned out he had a true knot in his umbilical cord and the cord was wrapped twice around his neck).  I know with my first pregnancy that I had a standard 25 day cycle and ovulated on day ten, with a positive pregnancy test 10 days later, so if the doctor had gone by those dates, my son would have been late under Naegele’s rule.  With #3 I ovulated around day 13, so had a more typical cycle length.

I’m considering it since there are risks such as meconium etc. However I’d rather base it on evidence and if my fluid levels and stress tests are normal I see no reason to wait until 42 weeks. My mom had both my sister and I “late” so there is that genetic factor.  My blood pressure has been rising a bit albeit still normal, so I just have to control that by exercising daily and a good diet.

I'm wondering what the odds are that I'll go into labor at 37 weeks. I've had no issues with this pregnancy so I'm thinking the chances are pretty small.  How many of you delivered their first baby around 37 weeks with no pre-existing conditions that would cause you to go into labor? Just wondering.

I had bronchitis, so I had been coughing really hard, but I don't think that could cause that so early... :)  Most first time moms go to term or later, though, I think.

This is my 3rd baby, and my first two came early. Baby #1 was born at 36 weeks 6lbs 12oz, and baby #2 was born at 38 weeks 7lbs 14oz. So I was trying to make labor predictions for myself, and seeing that I had my other babies early, was wondering if anyone delivered their previous children early, but then went all the way to their due date or overdue with their 3rd or subsequent pregnancies.       --  Ashley - married to my love for over a decade SAHM to DS12, DS10, & DD7, 👼🏾👼🏾👼🏾 TTC #4        See all comments from original poster (7)  Hide all comments from original poster (7)      Load more                    Report this post        1          Comments (34)        / 4                   anta#1    Last edited 02/02/2010      I am not sure I havent hit baby number three yet. But I heard that the third child could be sneaky some come out sooner then other. But due to your history I dont think you will go to 39 weeks so I would sit back relax because your labors come quick and you dont have a history of being overdue. Your lucky this is just my second so I have no idea whats in store lol    --  � ?  M y l o v e l y� L a V e n a 1 2 . 0 6 . 0 7 ?� � ?

My first was about 1 week early and I was induced with my 2nd at 37 wk 5d, with PIH. This time, all the troubles are much worse and started much earlier. I'm wondering if #3 will be earlier or not...most likely though. I was also trying to convince myself not to assume my labor will be just as easy! With #2, it was soooo fast! I hope this little man follows suit!

They told me they'd like me to hit at least 38w this time, but they think I'll get pre-eclampsia again at the same or earlier time.  The worst part is it's another c-section and the hospital won't allow the Dr. to book the operating room any earlier than 4 weeks prior to anyone's due date, and then the c/s has to be scheduled no earlier than someone's 39th week.  So with me, I have to wait until 8/1 to get my c/s date which will be some where between 8/22 and 8/29, but my own Dr. thinks I'll actually be having the baby somewhere around 8/10 if things work out the same way -- and there's no way I can plan for that.  They just seem to unintentionally make us nuts.

So far no signs of anything happening which is great.

The Odds of Baby Arriving on Their Due Date?           Without a doubt, you’ve heard lots of conflicting information on what a due date actually is.  Most believe the due date is a deadline. If Baby doesn’t arrive on that date, she’s late. If Baby comes before then, she’s automatically “premature.”        Some have theorized that due dates are an invention of modern medicine, and have become an excuse for doctors to perform c-sections. While that’s not what we believe, we do know that due dates are often inaccurate .  Baby should not be expected to arrive on an exact day (unless you’ve scheduled a c-section).  In fact, Baby should not be rushed at all unless there’s a medical reason to do so. According to the March of Dimes , a non-profit that “works to end premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality:”  “Labor should be induced only for medical reasons to protect the health of you and your baby. If your pregnancy is healthy, it’s best to let labor begin on its own without inducing labor.” // MarchofDimes.org  Due Date Statistics  Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants. You can also take the       Due Date Statistics Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants. You can also take the Note: The survey results were not verified. They rely on the honesty and accuracy of online participants. You can also take the survey here at SpaceFem.com.   What is the probability of spontaneous labor after 35 weeks?   Out of 11,1114 women, 8,464 went into labor spontaneously. This equals 76% of the total participants.   What is the probability of giving birth within X days of your due date?   Do babies come on their due dates? Not really, but they usually come sometime around it. Only 4.3% of babies arrived on their due date. Comparatively, 61.6% of non-induced babies arrive within one week of their due date.       What is the average length of pregnancy in weeks?    31.8% of babies were born at 40 weeks  25.7%  were born at 39 weeks  16.1% of babies were born at 41 weeks  13.5% were born at 38 weeks  6.4% were born at 37 weeks  2.8% were born at 36 weeks  2.1 % were born at 42 weeks  1.5% were born at 35 weeks  0.1% were born at 43 weeks.    What is the average length of pregnancy for subsequent births?   If your first baby comes early, will your second baby be early, too? If your second baby arrives late, does that mean your third will come late as well? According to the survey, on average, subsequent babies arrive 0.18 days later than the previous baby.  The average baby #2 came 0.44 days later than baby #1, based on 900 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.73 days earlier than baby #2, based on 187 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.58 days earlier than baby #1, based on 184 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.92 days earlier than baby #3, based on 50 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.19 days earlier than baby #2, based on 47 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.38 days earlier than baby #1, based on 48 mothers.    What is the length of pregnancy for first-time moms compared to second- and third-time moms?   On average, a first-time mom has her baby at 39 weeks 5 days. This is the equivalent of 54.8% of first-time moms giving birth on or before their due date compared to 56.7% of second-time moms, and 59.5% of third-time mothers.   Is there a connection between length of pregnancy and the type of delivery?    9% of the 8,670 women who went into labor spontaneously underwent a c-section.  19% of 2,343 women who were induced underwent a c-section.  Is there a correlation between induction and increased incidence of cesarean? You decide.   What is the relationship between the length of pregnancy and birth weight?   Are “late” babies huge? On average, “late” babies are generally bigger than “early” ones but not by much. The difference between a baby born at 39 weeks and one born at 41 weeks is about 300 grams.   What is the probability of induction after the due date?   Most doctors will induce a mom rather than let her get past her due date. According to the March of Dimes, however: “If your health care provider talks to you about inducing labor, ask if you can wait until at least 39 weeks to be induced. This gives your baby’s lungs and brain the time they need to fully grow and develop before he’s born.” // MarchofDimes.org   Is there a correlation between the age of the mother and the probability of spontaneous labor?   It has been theorized that the age of the mother has something to do with when labor sets in. Is it possible that the average due date would change depending on ethnicity, age or even country of origin? According to the survey, about the same number of women give birth on day 279 as 287.   Are more babies born on a full moon?   There is no correlation between the phase of the moon and when babies are born.   What is the most common day of the week for babies to be born?   According to the survey, the most common day for babies to be born is Thursday while the least common is Saturday.  Sunday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries and 1.6% induced births.  Monday 11% spontaneous deliveries and 3.2% induced births.  Tuesday 10.7% spontaneous deliveries 4.1% induced births.  Wednesday 10.9% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Thursday 13.1% spontaneous deliveries 4.5% induced births.  Friday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Saturday 10% spontaneous deliveries 2.3 % induced births.    What does it mean if I’m 40 weeks pregnant?   Congratulations! You’ve hit your due date and Baby is fully developed! Instead of stressing out that Baby’s not here yet, relax and enjoy the anticipation. 52% of the women surveyed were still pregnant at 40 weeks. 28.79% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 3 days (on or before 40W,3D). It’s normal to still be pregnant at this point. If your doctor or midwife is supportive of natural induction, consider these natural induction methods .  34.49% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 4 days (on or before 40W, 4D)  46.57% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 6 days (on or before 40W, 6D)  57.07% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 8 days (on or before 41W, 1D)  68.61% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 12 days (on or before 41W, 5D)  73.44% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 21 days (on or before 43W, 0D)  26.56% of babies were induced.    I know the exact date I conceived. Can I calculate my exact due date?   Typically, due dates have an 8- to 10-day variation as they are calculated from the last menstrual period, not date of conception. The question then arises, is it possible to calculate an exact due date based on conception date? According to the survey, the standard deviation does not improve even if you know the exact second your baby was conceived. Babies are individuals, just like adults. Some need more time in the womb than others.   Which babies are born earlier, boys or girls?   The average arrival time for babies of both sexes  is 39 weeks and 5 days.   Do inductions bias due date  statistics?   What if all the women who were induced were meant to give birth late? Doesn’t this change the average amount of time a pregnancy should last? Not really, according to the survey. If we assume each induction was actually a late birth, the average median would shift by 2 days.     First Published at www.spacefem.com.

Even though 37 weeks is still considered full term, studies show that babies born even a few weeks too early are at greater risk for health problems than those who are born later.

Photo Researchers      In her living room, Caroline Nagy introduces the newest member of her family — the 6-week-old infant in a striped onesie cradled in her arms. "This is Alex Joseph. He was born May 24th — my birthday," she says.  Their shared birthday wasn't entirely a coincidence. Two weeks before her due date, Nagy was swollen, and uncomfortable. So she asked her doctor for relief.  "I was just miserable. It was like uncomfortable to walk; I couldn't sit on the floor and play; I felt like I was neglecting my first kid because I just couldn't move and I couldn't do anything," says Nagy. "So I asked, 'Is there any way I can speed this up and have a baby earlier?' "  For Jackie McGinty, it wasn't discomfort but timing that caused her to schedule her daughter's birth by C-section eight years ago. McGinty's first child was delivered by C-section for medical reasons, and although this time around she had hoped to deliver naturally, she had just moved out of state and wanted her family nearby to help with the baby.  "My mom was coming out and she was only going to come out for a few weeks. I needed her to be there after the birth. ... So having the option to schedule it was good for us," says McGinty.     Harm In Planning Too Far Ahead?  Stories like these are common. Statistics show that from 1990 to 2006 the percentage of women who induced labor more than doubled, and nearly a third of women were having cesareans.      Enlarge this image       Caroline Nagy and her now 8-week-old infant in Youngstown, Ohio.

Gretchen Cuda Kroen for NPR  hide caption    toggle caption   Gretchen Cuda Kroen for NPR          Caroline Nagy and her now 8-week-old infant in Youngstown, Ohio. Nagy says she had labor induced early at 39 weeks because she was uncomfortable and felt as though she was neglecting her other child.  Gretchen Cuda Kroen for NPR     The increase wasn't because of emergencies, says Jay Iams, a specialist in maternal fetal medicine at Ohio State University, but rather because women and doctors began scheduling deliveries for convenience — "convenience for the mother, for the family, for the physician," says Iams. Sometimes, Iams says, it's because patients say to themselves, " 'I want only my doctor to be there. I don't want the person who's on call.' "  Having a baby naturally requires lots of planning.  But when it comes to the arrival date of your bundle of joy, experts now say that planning too far ahead can do more harm than good.  A full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, but elective deliveries are often planned for two or three weeks earlier. And even though 37 weeks is also still considered full term, studies show that babies born even a few weeks too early are at greater risk for health problems than those who are born later. That has some doctors campaigning to curb the trend of scheduled labor and delivery.  Pediatrician Ed Donovan of Cincinnati Children's Hospital says data collected over the past several decades show those babies have an increased risk of complications compared with waiting until the mother goes into labor spontaneously.  "It's now really well-documented in national studies that the risk of the baby having to require intensive care in a neonatal intensive care unit — even the risk of infant death — is increased when the baby is born as little as two weeks before the due date," says Donovan.  Organ Systems Maturing At Different Rates  The reasons for this are two-fold. First, without an ultrasound measurement in the first trimester, a woman's due date could be as much as two weeks off, making the fetus 35 weeks instead of 37.  And second, Donovan says the brain, heart, lungs, and immune system all mature at different rates — and some may need a little more time than others.  "Just because the lungs are mature doesn't mean that the other organ systems are mature," says Donovan.  "A baby born three weeks early with mature lungs may not be ready to eat because the brain's not fully developed."  According to Donovan, doctors realized they simply weren't very good at determining which babies were ready and which weren't. And Iams says the large numbers of sick babies made many doctors begin to think differently about early deliveries.         A baby's brain still has a lot of growing to do between 35 and 39 weeks in the womb.  Courtesy of March of Dimes   hide caption    toggle caption    Courtesy of March of Dimes     "Thirty-seven weeks is term, but they became the most common occupants of neonatal intensive care nurseries," says Iams. "And the pediatricians naturally said, 'They could have waited.' "  Still, many women and even many obstetricians remained unaware of the risks because it didn't fit with their experience.  "People see their friends having babies early, and sometimes women go into labor on their own at 37, 38 weeks — and that's not unusual and those babies are fine," says Jennifer Bailit, an obstetrician at Metro Health Medical Center in Cleveland. "But those are babies that have told us that they're coming and that they're ready."  Convincing Mothers It's Worth The Wait  Bailit is part of an effort led by Iams and Donovan to reduce the number of scheduled deliveries before 39 weeks across the state of Ohio.  Bailit says that she often has to explain to women the importance of those last few weeks — and that the discomfort is normal but something that needs to be endured for the sake of the baby.  "It's tough to be pregnant, and sometimes when you're in the moment it's hard to keep the big picture in mind," Bailit says. "When we guide people toward that kind of thinking it really helps them say, 'I'm doing this for my baby; it's worth it.' "  In addition to helping doctors like Bailit educate pregnant women, Iams and Donavan asked doctors at the 20 largest hospitals in the state to document a medical reason every time a woman was scheduled to deliver before 39 weeks. And much to their surprise, Iams says in under 15 months the rates of those deliveries dropped from 15 percent to under 5 percent. And more important, the number of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care also decreased.

The March of Dimes has taken what began in Ohio and a few other select states and extended it nationwide in a campaign it's calling "Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait." Alan Fleischman of the March of Dimes says the rate of elective births in the hospitals the organization has surveyed is about 30 percent.  "Most hospital leaders don't believe they have this problem until they actually measure it," says Fleischman. "And when they do, they're surprised."  As in Ohio, their preliminary data show that in only a short period of time, even hospitals with very high rates of scheduled deliveries are able to reduce them to about 5 percent or less by making a few simple changes — and in turn, increase the likelihood of a healthy baby.  Although inductions at 39 weeks and beyond are considered safe, some doctors feel that unless there is a medical reason to deliver early, the best labor plan for women is an old-fashioned one: Hang in there and wait until labor starts on its own.

I hit 37 weeks on Wed 6/16. I'm inclined to let him go. What do you think the chances are of my going into labor at 37 weeks? (And in general, not Murphy's Law of him being out of state and at a conference=going into labor hahaha) He can decline if need be; I'd hate to keep him from this work opportunity and then just sit around and be at home. Am still planning to be at work myself at that point. I'm a first time mom; no complications so far. I'm 34 weeks 1 day today. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  8 Posts M  MrsScardino6709 @chi_girl79  I'd ask your OB. I know that I was pretty concerned about it because both my husband and I were preemies and I just figured it was a risk. Plus I had been having a lot of braxton hicks. She checked me on Wednesday, though, and I wasn'tÂ dilatedÂ or anything. I'm 35 weeks now and she said that my little girl probably won't come early.Â From what I've heard, most first timers take longer. =) Good for those three days your DH will be out of town, but annoying as heck when we're past our due dates. lol k  katiemccarthy @chi_girl79  I am in the exact same situation. My DH is out of state on the 10th to the 13th. I am 37 weeks on the 15th. The whole thought makes me a little nervous because I am all alone here with no family. We live on Alabama and all family is in Canada. We are planning on him going.. But is going to be prepared to leave at the drop of a hat. And if anything does happen hopefully labour will be long enough. I know I am not providing any advice, but hopeing you are taking some comfort in tha fact that you arenot alone! : ) a  abdragonfly I think their could be a good chance because that's considered full-term. It depends on i'd you have someone else for L M  MidWestMomMN @chi_girl79  My first came at 37 weeks 3 days m  mamadasilvaXs3 @chi_girl79  It's not super common, but it has happened.  My sisters first LO made his appearance at 37 weeks, but my first LO wasnt here until 39 weeks 5 days. n  nycbabybump @chi_girl79  I agree with the pp. Ask your doc. I delivered my dd at 36 weeks so I know early is possible. Bc of that, we've had two recent internal sonograms to measure cervix length (they say is you're longer than 2.5 you're prob not going soon). Ask if they'd be willing to do this for your piece of mind at your next appt. I don't see why they wouldn't. But if you're not having any warning signs it should be ok. Most people have some sort of labor symptoms for a few days before full blown labor anyway. So do some digging and he on the lookout. Good luck! E  ElleBelles10 @chi_girl79  Well I'm a worry wart so I would probably wouldn't let my husband go!  haha  Just like you said....Murphy's Law.  You know if he goes you'd be more likely go into labor and if he stayed home you wouldn't.  I'd ask my doc and see what s/he says. If you went into labor, do you have someone else as a support person?  Or would he be able to leave the conference early?  If he goes, I would definitely have a back-up plan just in case.

She's head down and as the days pass by I feel her lower and lower. Today I felt like she was soooooo low that she was going to come out at any second lol. I know she'll come when she's ready :) it's just a waiting game lol. I think we should get an idea when the doctor checks our cervix and see if it's softening or if we are dilated. I know my doctor is going to check around 36 weeks. A  AJPsMommy @kreneealvarez  That's a great point, that's probably the best indicator! I just wish I knew exactly when he's coming haha. I feel a ton of movements super low, it's crazy! He's locked and loaded so now I'm nervous lol. f  forthischild2015 @AJPsMommy  Most first time moms will go to their due date or over. With our DD we had the most exact due date you can have since we did IVF and she came 3 days past my due date. My sister was 4 days past her due date with her first and 2 days before her due date with her second. There's no telling, babies just come when they come! s  selaynar1 i did my own math & everyone else did their bets lol. i believe i will go into labor at 38weeks (FTM) but my boyfriend says ill go into labor at 37 weeks sometime in the afternoon, my godfather says 37.5weeks & so on & on lol . All i know is my little peanut needs to stay until 38+ weeks e  empiel I think statistically for first time moms, you are more likely to go 40+ weeks than to go early. That being said, my first came at 38 weeks, and my second at 38.5 weeks, both weighed the same. I agree that a cervical check is probably the best indicator. My doc checked me with my first at a regular appointment, and told me I would likely have the baby within the next 24 hours, and I had him 7 hours later. b  brielise15 The average for a first time mom is 41 weeks, 1 day... but obviously some moms go much earlier - usually any later and they'll want to induce (if not before that). I think it's really hard to make any predictions. I've had a few people tell me stories of going to the dr to get checked, having the dr tell them they won't deliver anytime soon, and then going into labor later that day. I also just had a friend tell me her dr said that she would deliver early and she ended up going right up to her due date. There's really no telling. My baby has been super low with a lot of pressure, head down, all through my pregnancy but that doesn't mean I'll be early!!! L  LyssahBlue Just found a calculator that will tell you probability based on your due date.  Wish I could find one that took other factors into consideration, like age and activity level! http://spacefem.com/pregnant/due.php?use=EDD&m=11&d=15&y=15 M  Munkeroo Most likely to go overdue. That said I delivered my first at 36w 6 days. So who knows when this one will come. I'd like her to stay in a little longer than #1 but if I go overdue I might go crazy being pregnant 5+ weeks longer! Cervical checks really tell you nothing. You can be hard and closed and go into labour that night or you can walk around 3cm dilated for a month! y  yellowsprout Yeah, cervical checks don't tell you much. You can be dilated for many many weeks. Or not at all and go into labor that same day. I was dilated "a fingertip" when I went into active labor. Took hours and hours of labor for me to even dilate to a two. Everyone is different! Most first-time moms make it to their due date... Just speaking from personal experience, plenty of moms I know had their baby at 39ish weeks, but few before that. That being said, if you're not sure about when you conceived, your due date could definitely be off by a few days to a week or so. So "early" would really be on time. I did IUI with my daughter, so I know exactly when I conceived and that I delivered her 6 days past my due date. m  mosoria My daughter came at 39 weeks and my son at 37 . Just be ready baby can come any time after 37 weeks you just dont know m  mrsteague9311 Everyone is different. It all depends on your pregnancy. But typically first time moms are usually on time or a little after. They come when they are ready :) L  LeighRogers @AJPsMommy  I'm due 11/12 but when I go back on the 25th we're going to schedule the induction date. My dr. said somewhere between 38-39 weeks unless she comes early on her own. Personally, I think my due date is little off anyways and my dr. Said she's already down. t  theone914 My first was 37wks and we'll see about when this one comes. I'm learning from last time and planning on having things packed and ready to go starting this weekend (31wks). We were a little caught off guard last time. Lol. We were gonna pack that weekend and my water broke on Friday. Poor hubs had to come home and do laundry because he had no clean socks ;) e  elizabeth283 @AJPsMommy  Most ftms go over their due date. I know so many people that were convinced they would go early around 37 weeks. Think about how miserable it would be to be 41 weeks and still no baby after you convinced yourself you would have baby 4 weeks earlier! It doesn't hurt to have bags packed just in case. Cervical checks are not a good indication either. You can be dilated for 6 weeks and another totally closed up and either could go into labor first. I  ILoatheCailou Dilation and cervix softening doesn't really tell you anything. I walked around at 3 cm dilated for a week before going into labor. Statistically if you are a ftm you will go over your due date. I was early with both my kids (5days with the first, 10 with the second). Some indicators of labor include losing mucus plug, I  ILoatheCailou @ILoatheCailou  Sorry. My son hit send. Diarrhea, cramping, tightening of stomach area A  AJPsMommy Hmmm ok so I shouldn't put too much weight on the cervical checks either! I just need to get ready and stay ready for the day that he decides to show his little face :). j  jammers79 @AJPsMommy  3rd time mom here... Both my girls were 2 and 3 wks early..

Does anyone know how common this is vs going into labor naturally? I would prefer to go into labor at home and let it progress naturally until my contractions are close together before going to the hospital. I am afraid i will go ten days over and they will induce me which could mean days in the hospital before baby comes. Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  30 Posts l  luanafp @shelloc25  Not sure what the statistics are. I went into labour with my first one naturally at 38w1d and had an easy 10 hour labour. I did take LOTS of raspberry leaf tablets from week 34 onwards, maybe that helped. Unfortunately this time im scheduled for a c-section for medical reasons. m  mine27 @shelloc25  I'd heard alot of FTM going over too and was anxious about it but i went naturally at 37+6 with my first. t  tessadragon It really varies. Sis in law went into labor of her own accord: waters broke and she was told to go into hospital as waters breaking puts at risk of infection. If contractions had started without waters breaking, as long as you clear it with doctor you can wait longer before going in to hospital. First time babies can be early or can be late, not usually on time though. f  fournoggins I went into labor naturally on my due date with my first :) Even if you go over just trust your body and refuse an induction until it becomes medically necessary if that is what you want. m  melagasse I had my ob strip my membranes at my 40 week appt and I was having contractions before I got out of their building! Went to the hospital 6 hours later and had him about 8 hours after that. So not completely on my own but not induced. j  jill2778 The only baby that I had induced was #4. Weird in my opinion. :) m  mrsboisvenue With my first, I had a membrane sweep a little over 37.5 weeks at my doctors office and baby came a couple days later! Contractions started on there own and I stayed home until I was 5cm! I did this because I was very swollen and uncomfortable! Don't stress baby will get here one way or another! If you really want to wait it out express this to your doctor and see if they have any tips for bringing labor on at home b  babynayaka I think it depends on your ob/midwife. Mine let's you go two weeks over while my friends OB won't let you go more than a day over. That's really ridiculous if you consider that due dates are estimations and not an expiration date! I have long cycles and bet there are ladies in here with short cycles, conceived on the same day as me yet still have a due date after mine! 2  2girls1baby @shelloc25  You can go up to 2 weeks past your due date without being induced. n  nkappes13 I went into labor naturally with both my boys at 36 weeks. But I think they will give you a stress test when you get close and if baby is under a lot of stress and needs to come out, they will induce you. 1  1Queen1King3Princes With my first I went naturally at 35 weeks. r  rachelcap It's more likely to go over your due date with your first baby, but that doesn't mean you will need to be induced. You can choose to wait it out and monitor health of the baby. Some OBs will get nervous and push induction, though. Mine tried to pressure me into induction but I stood firm and waited to go into labor spontaneously at 42 weeks. I believe I could have ended up with a c-section if I had agreed to an induction so I'm glad I waited for my body to go into labor. m  michellenajarro With my first baby I went into labor naturally on her due date and she was born that same day. A  AWeaver2010 @shelloc25  I went into labor at 37 weeks naturally and my water broke on its own at home:) l  lalalaura88 @shelloc25  I just learned in my birth class that 41 weeks should be how long to expect, not the due date given at the hospital... So add 7 days to your due date. And your body will go into labor when it's ready. The only reason to induce is if your water breaks and labor hasn't started 24-48 hours after the water breaks because there would be a chance for infection:) J  J0607 You can go up to 42 weeks some obs get impatient and like to induce but honestly in my opinion it leads up to more complications, even c sections. There are lots of ways to naturally induce you just need to look it up. j  jennaemmerich @shelloc25  FTM here but my mom went naturally a week early with my brother and on my due date with me. b  beccavalerio My first had to be induced... she was almost 2 weeks late and wasn't showing any signs of wanting to vacate her comfy resting spot. I went to the hospital at 6am - had my labor induced and she was born by 4pm that afternoon - less than 12 hrs from start to finish!!! My water broke all on it's on for my second while I was getting my dogs ready for bed on a Sunday night. I didn't go to the hospital until the next morning AFTER I stopped off at Wal-Mart to grab a few things I forgot for my hospital bag. I was hoping that since my water broke all on it's own I wouldn't have to worry about an induction but no such luck. Things progressed so slow that by Monday evening they had to give me medication to move things along. She didn't arrive unit 3:30 am on Tuesday..... 36 hours of labor..... yuck. I'm hoping this one somewhere in between. :-) m  mamadeez @shelloc25  I have heard that FTM go over due date but haven't heard that most are induced. I went 2 days early with my first and 10 days late with my second. I haven't heard of anybody I know, needing to be induced with their first. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Your baby will come when they are ready and most likely go naturally. :) Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  17 Posts v  vanessamw @ftm_kristin  If this is your first baby and your dates seem sure I think you have nothing to worry about. My first one dropped at 36 weeks and I was 2 cm for a whole month!! First time moms rarely deliver early. Especially healthy non smoking ones. f  ftm_kristin Thanks. We are sure on the dates (had a dating ultrasound) so that makes me feel better :) J  Jewlz2121 @ftm_kristin  I wouldn't worry about him missing anything. I would just stay put yourself. l  lizjohnson1026 I delivered my dd 2 weeks early because there wasn't enough fluid left. A couple days before I delivered I thought my water broke and went to the hospital. After a couple hours they told me it didn't and sent me home. Then I went in for my follow-up from the hospital and told the doctor was she hadn't been moving much. They did an ultrasound and showed she only had 4 liters left and made to go to the hospital right away. They induced me and she was born the next day perfectly healthy. She is a happy 3 year old now! j  jenaandrob @Jewlz2121  my mom had me at just 37 weeks I was her first, I do not want to scare you but just giving you my moms reality, and my brother was at 38 weeks s  shaunal74 @ftm_kristin  With my first, my water broke at 36w1d. I had a lot of early labor signs the day before. If he is set on going, I would just be really intune to what you are feeling the few days before. f  freckle53 @ftm_kristin  I think the chances are small and would be the result of complications. My first was evicted at 41w5d. A  Artsymama3 @ftm_kristin  It's a pretty small number of women who go that early. I wouldn't worry, but have a plan in place in case it does happen, like who is going to bring you to the hospital. My boys were 2 weeks late and 6 days late. The reality is that most women are late or only a few days before there due date with their first. Second time is usually shorter. You just might want some help around the house because you'll be pretty tired by then. f  ftm_kristin Thanks for the replies, ladies. We're still in the "discussion" part of it, but I'm thinking he's probably going to go. Good idea about havibg a plan in place though. M  MommaMaki @ftm_kristin  My water broke with my first at 35w5d, and I had him within 13 hrs. Be in tune with your body. If you don't feel comfortable going, don't. Your baby will come when s/he wants to come and doesn't care about due dates. m  mamadimples @ftm_kristin  I delivered both of mine at 37 weeks and they came on their own (wasn't induced). a  amyjo1986 I don't want to scare you but you gotta know sometimes life just happens :( I had dd barely at 36wks and was a complete scare and lead to emergency c-section (I had a severe case of pancreatitis, mortality rate 1-5). I could've died if I wouldn't have had the care I had in the short time. I was young and healthy we would've never guessed in a million years it would've happened! L  Lauren_Sandoval I went into labor at 36 weeks. Everyone is different. Are kiddos just have a mind of there own :) k  kls91209 @ftm_kristin  I had my first baby at 36 weeks.  I had a perfect pregnancy...no complications.  Nothing was wrong with the baby...she just wanted to come out! Personally, I would tell your husband to book his trip a couple weeks earlier :) You never know!  v  vanessamw @amyjo1986  This is not the norm. Tell your husband to enjoy his trip. It may be his last for a while!!!! You are always going to hear the worst case scenarios and are not going to hear from the thousands of "normal" scenarios. g  germaphobemomma @ftm_kristin  My husband had to go on travel for work when I was 37 weeks with our first, and we were terrified since he would be on the opposite side of the country.  We asked the doctor, and she said there was almost no chance of me going into labor at that point.  It would be unusual.  I wound up having my daughter on her due date.  Everyone else I know went past their due date with their first.  Good luck!

I wasn't in active labor and they don't know why my water broke but it did. Just so you know he didn't have any health issues -he was just really skinny and had a little trouble with his breathing a couple of times in the fist 24 hours because during a vaginal birth the "gunk" in their lungs gets squeezed out but not during a c-section.. I'm hoping my water doesn't break before 37 weeks with this one. Except for medical reasons, I don't get why people are in such a hurry to get LOs out around now. I see posts about using castor oil, etc... to get labor started and I just don't get it at this point. I understand that we are all uncomfortable, etc... but I'm praying for a full term baby. Why are you having a c-section at 37 weeks? l  luvemi831 @CarrieKU  I agree. I think there is nothing wrong with having a c-section/ inducing for medical reasons, but choosing the deliver that early is a completely different matter. l  luvemi831 @opaquelace  You are having the c-section for medical reasons, not because you just don't feel like being pregnant anymore. There's a difference because it can't be helped. I am sure your babies will do great, this is more warning against people that are electing to give birth early. l  luvemi831 @opaquelace  You are having the c-section for medical reasons, not because you just don't feel like being pregnant anymore. There's a difference because it can't be helped. I am sure your babies will do great, this is more warning against people that are electing to give birth early. l  luvemi831 @faithg  It's good to hear your son was fine. I am sure it is not common for infants to have severe issues at 37 weeks, just more common than if they went full term (0bviously this is not the case if you go into labor naturally.) What really gets me is the posts like the one we had a few weeks ago where people say if they went into labor at 34/35 weeks they wouldn't want to call the doctor because the baby must "want" to be born. If at 37 weeks the chance for complications and death are increased, then at that early the chances are even more so. Why chance it? f  fitzmomma @luvemi831  I totally agree on waiting until term to induce if possible and let nature run it's course unless a medical reason says otherwise..  I would like to point out, however, that the study mentioned seems to rate all babies born at 37 weeks, not just those induced electively, so it would include babies that were induced due to problems or simply born early therefore skewing the mortality rates (obviously babies taken out early because they are already having issues are more likely to have problems than those who have had a normal pregnancies).  It would be interesting to just see the stats on elective inductions by themselves....  Still, I totally agree with the message of the article. T  Tinuviel42 I'm on medicine to stop preterm labor. I sure hope I can just suck it up for a few more weeks. If not, I guess that just makes me an *sshole. S  Sabbaticalsurprise @Tinuviel42  I think you read this post wrong... they're talking about people electively trying to get their bodies to go into labor earlier... If you're fighting preterm labor, this isnt about you. You have a valid medical complication that you are actively trying to keep your baby in for as long as possible. I am glad you've made it this far and are continuing. It's better for you and your baby. You're not just hot and bloated and looking to force yourself into having contractions. o  opaquelace @luvemi831  Oh definitely for medical reasons.  I wish I could be let to go into labor naturally, but at this point it doesn't even look like I'll make my c-section date at this point with my blood pressure spikes.  I definitely know people who have "disagreed" with my doctor, but they aren't doctors lol...so I don't listen. l  luvemi831 @Tinuviel42  I am having a c-section at 37 weeks due to medical reasons, and now my doctor is talking about 36 weeks. You are not choosing to go into labor, your body is doing it naturally and you are trying to do what you can to keep you lo as long as possible. People like you and I are not who they are referring to. l  luvemi831 @fitzmomma  That is an interesting point. I would think they would have taken that into account, but I guess you never know. Personally, unless my water broke, I would definitely prefer the baby stayed in as long as she needed. l  luvemi831 @opaquelace  Don't you love how everyone has their opinions.

Read on to find out when your baby will make his appearance. By Lauren Picker from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print 7 Must-Know Truths About Due Dates RELATED:  A New Test Can Predict Your Actual Due Date Bet on Unpredictability As a journalist who's accustomed to meeting deadlines, I wasn't surprised when, during my first pregnancy, I went into labor on my due date. The second time around was another matter. My due date came and went. And went, and went, and went. It wasn't until the day before my doctor planned to induce me—at nearly 42 weeks pregnant —that I finally went into labor. My experience brought home one of the essential truths of pregnancy: Your due date is anything but predictable. Still, your doctor needs to determine one that's as accurate as possible so that any necessary tests are done at the correct time. "And knowing how far along you are makes it easier for your obstetrician to see that your baby is growing properly," explains ob-gyn Joanne Stone, M.D., coauthor of Pregnancy for Dummies . RELATED: How You'll Know if You're in Labor Wondering when to expect your new arrival? Find out now. The Dating Game To calculate your due date , your doctor will take the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), and add 280 days (the equivalent of 40 weeks). For example, if your last period started on September 1, your due date would be June 7. This method assumes that your period arrives like clockwork every 28 days. If your cycles are longer, you're likely to deliver later than your due date; if they're shorter, expect to deliver earlier. A first-trimester sonogram is more trustworthy. Your doctor measures the length of the fetus and size of the gestational sac. If these numbers don't match up with what your LMP would predict, she may adjust your due date. But even if your doctor can pinpoint your due date with laserlike precision, don't expect your baby to show up right on schedule. Because, for all the windows into your womb, no one really understands what triggers labor. One possible (but, as my experience shows, imperfect) predictor: your past performance. "Patients tend to repeat what they did in a previous pregnancy," says Iffath Hoskins, M.D., executive director of the Women's Service at the Memorial Health University Medical Center, in Savannah, Georgia. If you're a first-time mom, look at your mother's childbirth history. "If your mother delivered one week past her due date, you are more apt to deliver one week past your due date as well," explains Fredric D. Frigoletto, Jr., M.D., chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Sooner Than Expected Most women—about 80 percent—deliver sometime between 37 and 42 weeks. So where does that leave the other 20 percent? About 11 percent deliver prematurely. Experts aren't sure why some women go into labor early. Possible risk factors include carrying multiples or having an abnormally shaped uterus. There may also be a connection between preterm labor and an infection such as bacterial vaginosis. Even your build can play a role—women who weigh less than 110 pounds are at slightly higher risk. Waiting It Out Once you've passed your due date, you may wonder whether your baby will arrive later than 42 weeks, or post-term. While Caucasian women tend to have slightly longer pregnancies, as do women under 30, no one knows why some babies take their own sweet time. However, your baby's gender could be a clue: One study found that boy fetuses are more likely to go beyond their due date than girls. Beginning at 40 or 41 weeks, expect to undergo weekly, then twice-weekly, nonstress tests. If your pregnancy progresses beyond this point, there's a risk that the quality of the placenta will deteriorate, the amniotic-fluid level will decline, or that your baby will pass a bowel movement, known as meconium. "Babies begin to practice breathing, and they can aspirate the meconium into their lungs—causing postdelivery problems," Dr. Frigoletto says. In addition, because your baby is still growing, you're at higher risk of needing a C-section . For these reasons, your doctor may want to induce labor once you hit 42 weeks. Whether you give birth exactly on your due date—or in the weeks before or after—doesn't really matter in the long run. After all, you'll just be happy to meet your newborn whenever she arrives.

If you consider 4 weeks (28 days) a month, then there are 36 weeks in 9 months. If you consider a month 30-31 days, then there are closer to 40 weeks in 9 months.                 hoping+praying    Answered 1/17/08               5 found this helpful     yes 36 weeks is 9 months and when u turn 40 weeks your actually 10 months                 ladorothy_is_mom    Answered 12/22/08               5 found this helpful     36 weeks equals 9 lunar months. 40 weeks equals 10 lunar months. Since not all months have the same number of days, the doc's calculate gestation by weeks-more accurate. So, you are in fact pregnant for 9 calendar months/10 lunar months.                 Kalyber02    Answered 7/8/10               5 found this helpful     You are not pregnant for 10 months. There are 30-31 days in a month not 28 and you are not actually pregnant for the first 2 weeks. Your due date is calculated by the first day of your last period but your conception date is not until about two weeks after that.                 francobaby1    Answered 12/14/10               5 found this helpful     Paint thinner was accidentally spilled in my house.

Pregnancy   How Accurate are Due Dates?                     by Shannon Philpott Apr 01, 2014      Photograph by Getty Images/PhotoAlto The anticipation of knowing exactly when your baby will be born is exciting. When a physician determines your due date, however, it's not always a guarantee of the day your child will be born. Due dates are determined based on a number of factors, including your menstrual cycles and the baby's measurements, which can predict your baby's expected date of delivery within a week or two. RELATED: Dr. Drai Evaluating Your Cycles Due dates are accurate if you have regular monthly periods; obstetricians often calculate the due date based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, says Dr. Draion Burch, Pennsylvania-based obstetrician-gynecologist. However, women who have irregular periods can have inaccurate dates determined, he says. Burch recommends confirming due dates within the first trimester to improve the accuracy of the due date. Analyzing Baby's Size Due dates are also calculated based on the baby's body length during an ultrasound between eight and 12 weeks of pregnancy, according to Dr. Sachchidananda Maiti, England-based obstetrician and gynecologist. This method is more accurate than calculating through menstrual dates, he says, but it is not as good at dating your due date if you had assisted conception with fertility drugs and treatments. Doctors usually give women a range between 38 and 42 weeks of a pregnancy as the anticipated delivery time. Deciphering Accuracy Due dates are often referred to as estimated due dates because a woman's cycle and the baby's growth can vary, says Deena Blumenfeld, Pennsylvania-based Lamaze certified childbirth educator. "Only 5 percent of women give birth on their due dates, so we often tell moms that it is more like a due months," she says. Although premature delivery is possible, most women deliver between 37 and 42 weeks. Women aren't officially overdue until after 42 weeks of pregnancy, says Blumenfeld. RELATED: Shining Light Prenatal Education Measuring Baby's Growth Although your due date may be determined based on an ultrasound or your menstrual cycle, a margin of error with the date's accuracy is possible because of the baby's growth, says Blumenfeld. Babies grow and develop at different rates in the womb, just as they do on the outside, she says. "There is a range of normal for fetal development and that affects when labor begins," says Blumenfeld.

Why Is 40 Weeks so Important?  Your Baby is very important to you. Remember every week counts! Keep your baby inside until its time!  Near the end of your pregnancy you may be uncomfortable or anxious to see your baby. But remember -- you want to be sure you deliver a full term baby if possible.  How long is full term?  Pregnancy lasts for about 280 days or 40 weeks.  A preterm or premature baby is delivered before 37 weeks of your pregnancy.   Extremely preterm infants are born 23 through 28 weeks.  Moderately preterm infants are born between 29 and 33 weeks.  Late preterm infants are born between 34 and 37 weeks.   Babies born before 39 weeks gestation have a greater chance of breathing problems, low blood sugar and other problems that may result in being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. So be patient!  What causes preterm births?  There are many factors that may lead to a preterm birth. Women who have had a previous preterm baby are at highest risk for another preterm baby. Women carrying multiple babies (such as twins or triplets) or have uterine or cervical abnormalities (such as fibroid tumors in their uterus) are also at high risk.  Other factors that put you at risk for a preterm birth include:   Diabetes;  High blood pressure;  Blood clotting disorders;  Problems with the placenta or bleeding;  Overweight or underweight;  Short time between pregnancies;  Late or no prenatal care;  Smoking, drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs; and  Stress.   What are the risks of a preterm birth?  Having a baby before your due date puts the baby at higher risk for many health problems.  Babies born before 39 weeks gestation can have problems. Choosing to have your baby by induction , or C-section may seem convenient, but it puts both you and your baby at risk for problems.  The March of Dimes , a national organization whose mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality,recommends that inductions be performed only for the health of the mother or the baby.   March of Dimes   What are the problems with having a baby before my due date?  A baby's brain is the last major organ to develop during your pregnancy, so every day your baby stays inside your uterus is important for your baby! The part of the brain that the baby will use for thinking doubles in size during the last few weeks of your pregnancy. When you are 35 weeks pregnant, your baby's brain only weighs two-thirds of what it will weigh at 40 weeks.  Some of the health problems that preterm babies may have include:   Problems breathing and keeping warm;  Feeding problems because they may have more trouble sucking and swallowing;  Newborn jaundice, which causes their skin and the white part of their eyes to look yellow;  A longer hospital stay after they are born or be in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;  Are more often readmitted to the hospital with problems; and  A smaller and less developed brain when they are born.   Even if the baby does well when born, he or she may have more long-term health problems such as:   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); and  As adults, they are more likely to get diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.   I want my baby to be healthy as possible. What can I do?  Sometimes no matter what you do, you may have a preterm baby, but there are things you can do to help prevent it.   If you are just thinking about getting pregnant, then get as healthy as you can before you get pregnant.  Preconception Care: A Guide for Optimizing Outcomes      If you smoke, stop.

By Jennifer L. W. Fink from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Tetra Images/ Getty Images  Mel Grego's doctor agreed to induce her at 38 weeks so that her baby would share a birthday with his father and grandmother. The mom from Hudson, Wisconsin, believed the date would bring her good fortune during the delivery. However, that didn't turn out to be the case. Grego ended up having an unplanned cesarean section , and her son developed a mild case of jaundice after he was born—a complication that sometimes occurs when a baby is born early. In fact, experts now believe that you should do everything in your power to make it to your due date , unless there's a medical reason to deliver your child sooner. New research suggests that birthing a baby prior to 39 weeks puts him at higher risk for a range of health and developmental problems. "The evidence is so compelling that a growing number of American hospitals are launching programs to help prevent elective deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation," says Diane Ashton, M.D., deputy medical director of the March of Dimes. Learn more about the benefits of waiting from our experts. What "Term" Means Now For years, babies were considered term (what we often call full-term) between 37 and 41 weeks of pregnancy. Most physicians believed that major organ development was complete by 37 weeks and that babies simply packed on pounds during the last stretch of pregnancy. The latest research, however, has proved them wrong. "We now know that important organs, such as the lungs and the brain, are not fully developed until 39 weeks," says Jason K. Baxter, M.D., an ob-gyn who specializes in high-risk pregnancies at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, in Philadelphia. One study, for example, found that babies born by C-section before 39 weeks have more breathing difficulties than babies delivered by C-section after 39 weeks. Furthermore, babies delivered electively at 37 weeks are four times more likely to end up in the neonatal intensive care unit or have serious respiratory troubles than babies born at 39 weeks or later; babies who arrive at 38 weeks are twice as likely to have complications. As a result of these findings, experts now don't consider babies term until 39 weeks. Infants born during weeks 37 and 38 are considered early term. Why Those Last Weeks Matter You may be tempted to ask your doctor for an early induction because of swollen ankles or an aching back, but that final month is critical to your baby's good health. For starters, a compound in her lungs called surfactant, which enables her to breathe independently, continues to be produced in greater amounts during the last month of pregnancy and decreases her risk of developing breathing problems once she arrives. Her liver is still undergoing changes that will enable it to properly filter toxins, such as jaundice-causing bilirubin, out of her body. Her skin is thickening and she is accumulating more body fat, which will help her to maintain her own body temperature after she's born. Brain development is still underway; at 35 weeks, for example, its volume is only about two thirds of what you'd expect at 39 to 40 weeks, says Dr. Ashton. Additionally, important brain and nerve connections are being made to help her suck, swallow, breathe, regulate her body temperature, and even sleep better once she's born. How Sticking It Out Helps You Avoiding medical interventions and allowing your body to go into labor naturally has major benefits for you too. You're more likely to have a smoother birth, explains Kathleen Simpson, Ph.D., a clinical nurse specialist at Mercy Hospital, in St. Louis. According to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the average labor time for first-time moms undergoing a planned induction was 14.5 hours, compared with ten or 11 hours for first-timers who went into labor on their own. Artificially starting labor also increases your odds of having a C-section by 50 percent. In order to induce labor, medication is typically administered to soften the cervix and start contractions; a second drug, pitocin, can cause particularly intense contractions. If your cervix doesn't dilate all the way, or if your contractions aren't progressing, your doc will opt for a C-section. And while most C-sections today go off without a hitch, they're still considered major abdominal surgery. Furthermore, letting your baby arrive when he's ready increases your chances of being able to bond with him as soon as he's born, rather than having to wait to hold him until after he's out of intensive care. Compared with the joy of having that first cuddle with your baby, the discomfort of those last few weeks is something you'll soon forget.
