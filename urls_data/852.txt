The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

What kind of car? What weather conditions? How many vehicles were involved? We’re the occupents wearing their safety belts? There variable are nearly endless. I will say this, there have been accidents where a person accelerated to a maximum of 10 miles per hour and hit a pole in a parking lot and died while another person was thrown from a car going 170 miles per hour across the pavement and lived. There is no set statistic to calculate without knowing the person, vehicle and the entire situation and scenario. One good thing is that every year vehicle safety devices are getting better with new designs and innovations that increase the survivability of even the most horrendous car accident. 352 Views Related Questions More Answers Below What are the odds of surviving a head-on car crash at high speed?

Answered Jul 4, 2016 · Author has 4.4k answers and 6.4m answer views From Wikipedia From 1979 to 2005, the number of deaths per year decreased 14.97% while the number of deaths per capita decreased by 35.46%. In 2010, there were an estimated 5,419,000 crashes (30,296 fatal crashes), killing 32,999 and injuring 2,239,000. The 32,479 traffic fatalities in 2011 were the lowest in 62 years (1949). Given 5,419,000 crashes of which only 30,296 caused fatalities, ignoring details such as the number of passengers per car, pedestrian deaths etc, we can estimate that the probability of surviving a car crash in 2010 was 99.994% and is likely to be much the same today. With extremely rare exceptions one could say that car crashes are generally survivable, which makes sense given that statistically most crashes are fender-benders with no personal injury, not high-speed writeoffs. 2.8k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder This site reveals driving history.

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

Turns out it varies wildly, depending on where you live.   To get an overarching look at how deadly the roads are in all 50 states, plus DC, we combined government data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. (Check out the table at the end to see the raw numbers for yourself.) Here's every state, ranked by how likely you are to be killed in a car crash, plus some other terrifying factoids. Hint: be careful when you're out walking around in Florida.

Washington, DC   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/32,322  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/14,053  Total population: 646,449  Total licensed drivers: 405,555  Total number of deaths in 2013: 20 How is it possible that the city topping our Worst Damn Freeways in America ranking comes in as the least likely place to die in a car? Well, probably because the freeways are so damn awful, people drive less: with an average of 8,697 miles per driver per year, people stay away from the the known horrors of the streets.              50. Massachusetts   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/20,530  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/11,421  Total population: 6,692,824  Total licensed drivers: 4,765,586  Total number of deaths in 2013: 326 With just 1.05 vehicles per licensed driver, Massachusetts has among the fewest cars per capita in the country.    49. New Jersey   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,419  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/7,772  Total population: 8,899,339  Total licensed drivers: 6,081,386  Total number of deaths in 2013: 542 This one really shouldn't be all that surprising, given the number of people who take trains into NYC every day.    48. New York   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,390  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,860  Total population: 19,651,127  Total licensed drivers: 11,210,723  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,199 The average New York driver actually drives a little bit more (12,154 miles) than the national average each year, though only 70% of all New Yorkers over the age of 16 actually have a license, and there's less than one car per licensed driver.              47. Rhode Island   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,177  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/9,144  Total population: 1,051,511  Total licensed drivers: 749,232  Total number of deaths in 2013: 65 Despite low overall numbers, a majority of fatal accidents in Rhode Island are single-car collisions.

Washington   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/15,989  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,032  Total population: 6,971,406  Total licensed drivers: 5,301,630  Total number of deaths in 2013: 436 Nearly 96% of Washington's of-age population has a license, but they don't drive all that much, averaging 8,949 miles per car.    45. Alaska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,414  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,870  Total population: 735,132  Total licensed drivers: 528,873  Total number of deaths in 2013: 51 How many miles does the average Alaskan vehicle see in a year? It's 6,169. Of course, that could also be the height in inches of annual snowfall, so there's a reasonably correlative relationship here.              44. Minnesota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,006  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,523  Total population: 5,420,380  Total licensed drivers: 3,330,725  Total number of deaths in 2013: 387 Despite having more roads than all but four states, Minnesotans are among the least likely to get their licenses. Those that do, though, rack up over 17,000 mile per year, and are among the most likely to slam into someone else.    43. Hawaii   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,765  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,951  Total population: 1,404,054  Total licensed drivers: 915,033  Total number of deaths in 2013: 102 Hawaii has the fewest miles of road of any state in the union, and it's also among the roughest. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii has the fewest miles of road per fatal crash (48) of any state.              42. Utah   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,186  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,778  Total population: 2,900,872  Total licensed drivers: 1,661,219  Total number of deaths in 2013: 220 With 16,256 miles per driver, you might expect Utah to have more than 46,254 miles of road. Then again, one of the prime allures of the state is what you can do without roads.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Ilirjan Rrumbullaku      41. Connecticut   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,029  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,672  Total population: 3,596,080  Total licensed drivers: 2,534,090  Total number of deaths in 2013: 276 Most adults in Connecticut have a license, and while they drive almost as much as the national average, one out of every 7,615 registered vehicles will be involved in a fatal accident each year.              40. Illinois   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,999  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,390  Total population: 12,882,135  Total licensed drivers: 8,261,582  Total number of deaths in 2013: 991 Even with the fourth most roads in the country, Illinoisans (Illini?) are actually pretty good about not putting themselves in life-threatening situations.    39. California   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,778  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,063  Total population: 38,332,521  Total licensed drivers: 24,390,236  Total number of deaths in 2013: 3,000 You're not actually better off in the car in California, but with a 1/43,363 chance of getting killed by a car even if you're not in a moving vehicle, it kinda seems like it sometimes.              38. Maryland   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,750  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,480  Total population: 5,928,814  Total licensed drivers: 4,140,105  Total number of deaths in 2013: 465 Cars in Maryland see 14,787 miles each year, despite having just 32,422 miles of road in the state. That probably speaks to the nightmare of commuting from the outskirts of DC more than anything else, but there's still less than one car per driver for the entire state.    37. Oregon   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,556  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,189  Total population: 3,930,065  Total licensed drivers: 2,773,373  Total number of deaths in 2013: 313 Oregon likes to consider itself a bicycle-friendly state, and with just 55 fatalities among people not inside a moving vehicle, there might very well be something to that.

Ohio   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/11,700  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,374  Total population: 11,570,808  Total licensed drivers: 8,030,421  Total number of deaths in 2013: 989 Interestingly, Ohio tied for the highest average number of vehicles per collision, with 1.62. In other words, people in Ohio are statistically less likely to hit stationary objects.    35. Virginia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/11,163  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,813  Total population: 8,260,405  Total licensed drivers: 5,602,765  Total number of deaths in 2013: 740 The average Virginian drives over 14,400 miles each year, though less than 85% of those eligible actually hold a license.              34. Colorado   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,953  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,295  Total population: 5,258,367  Total licensed drivers: 3,837,488  Total number of deaths in 2013: 481 Only three states have more deaths per collision than Colorado, though the reasons for that could be anything from high rates of SUV usage to carpooling.    33. Nevada   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,649  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,947  Total population: 2,790,136  Total licensed drivers: 1,756,095  Total number of deaths in 2013: 262 According to the statistics, there are two things you really don't want to be in Nevada: a pedestrian or a driver. Both have abnormally high death rates, while overall accidents and passenger deaths are pretty average.              32. Wisconsin   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,576  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,925  Total population: 5,742,713  Total licensed drivers: 4,171,427  Total number of deaths in 2013: 543 In somewhat of a paradox, Wisconsin ranks right up there with the best states for fewest deaths per fatality accident, but it's also one of the states with the most cars involved per collision.       related           All 50 States, Ranked by Their Roadside Attractions        related           Every State, Ranked by Its Food                    Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Peter Miller      31. Pennsylvania   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,574  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,095  Total population: 12,773,801  Total licensed drivers: 8,896,590  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,208 Pennsylvania is a vastly different state between its eastern and western halves, and while numbers would probably paint a very different picture between the two, our data doesn't break down like that, and the state averages out to middle of the pack.              30. Michigan   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/10,449  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,069  Total population: 9,895,622  Total licensed drivers: 6,986,587  Total number of deaths in 2013: 947 Michigan is nearly 30% smaller than Pennsylvania by population, and while the statistics bear that out across most categories, Michiganders actually drive almost as many total miles as their Big Ten neighbors.    29. New Hampshire   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,803  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/5,805  Total population: 1,323,459  Total licensed drivers: 1,061,433  Total number of deaths in 2013: 135 A total of 97.6% of all legal-age New Hampshirites hold a valid driver's license. They combine for among the fewest cars involved per accident of any state. Which means a lot of single car accidents, and collisions with stationary objects. Go figure?              28. Iowa   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,749  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,867  Total population: 3,090,416  Total licensed drivers: 2,143,665  Total number of deaths in 2013: 317 Iowans have more cars per driver than all but three other states, but despite being so car-heavy, it's the third safest state for pedestrians.    27. Delaware   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,351  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,208  Total population: 925,749  Total licensed drivers: 723,657  Total number of deaths in 2013: 99 All things considered, Delaware is relatively safe for drivers, though it's one of the more dangerous states for pedestrian traffic.

Vermont   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/9,082  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,973  Total population: 636,630  Total licensed drivers: 543,057  Total number of deaths in 2013: 69 Amazingly, Vermont has more licensed drivers than residents over the age of 16. It also has a disproportionately large number of passenger fatalities along its 14,266 miles of road.    24. Nebraska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,856  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/4,089  Total population: 1,868,516  Total licensed drivers: 1,374,529  Total number of deaths in 2013: 211 Nebraska's pedestrians are among the safest in the country, with fewer than one out of every 100,000 residents struck each year.              23. Georgia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,475  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3,987  Total population: 9,992,167  Total licensed drivers: 6,607,016  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,179 Georgians put, on average, 14,055 miles on each car every year. Just two states top that, which makes Georgia's fatal crash-per-mile rate actually fairly good.    22.

Florida   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/8,123  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/3.972  Total population: 19,552,860  Total licensed drivers: 13,670,441  Total number of deaths in 2013: 2,407 If you're not in a moving vehicle, you have a 1 in 29,627 chance of being killed by a car in Florida. The 660 people to meet such a fate in 2013 were by far the most in the US.              19.

Simply put, it's because the average Oklahoman drives so much every year that death rate for drivers is the second highest in the country.              5.

West Virginia   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/5,585  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,840  Total population: 1,854,304  Total licensed drivers: 1,177,136  Total number of deaths in 2013: 332 Only Texas, New York, and Washington DC have lower rates of licensed drivers.    3. North Dakota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,888  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,436  Total population: 723,393  Total licensed drivers: 513,838  Total number of deaths in 2013: 148 Good news and bad news for North Dakotans: pedestrians are far less likely to get hit in ND than any other state, and it's not even close. That said, drivers are most likely to die here, with one out of every 4,392 running out of luck, and one out of every 2,390 being involved in a crash that claimed a life.              2. Mississippi   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,880  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,516  Total population: 2,991,207  Total licensed drivers: 1,968,907  Total number of deaths in 2013: 613 Mississippians put 18,692 miles on the average vehicle, which is the most in the US by a wide margin. Then again, only Maryland, New York, and DC have fewer cars per driver.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Jimmy Emerson      1. Montana   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/4,433  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/2,302  Total population: 1,015,165  Total licensed drivers: 766,716  Total number of deaths in 2013: 229 Montana has the most cars per driver at just over two, and the second-highest number of deaths per fatality crash, behind New Mexico. Yet somehow, with just 1.31 vehicles involved per collision, it's the state where drivers are most likely to hit stationary objects. And yes, that also means it's on par with Florida for hitting pedestrians.                         Share on Facebook      Pin it        Aaron Miller/Thrillist     About the data  The data used here is from both the NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System , and the FHWA .    The ranking itself is actually very basic: it's the total population of each state divided by the number of people killed in automotive accidents for the given year (2013).   The rest of the data involved, however, is where things get interesting:    Being Involved in a fatal crash : The NHTSA keeps such thorough accounts of every fatality accident that we know exactly how many people were in each vehicle for every single crash. Since surviving such an incident is inarguably a horrific and traumatizing experience, dividing the total population by the number of crashes is a sobering way to realize just how fragile life can be.    Being involved, as a driver: Simply put, the more you drive, the higher your chances of being involved in an incident. We took the population of licensed drivers and divided by the total number of accidents.              Dying in a crash, as a driver: Similar to being involved in a crash, because the NHTSA actually notes who was injured or killed while sitting where in a vehicle, we were able to calculate the odds of dying as a driver by dividing the licensed population by the number of people who died while driving.    Dying while you're not even in a moving vehicle: This includes pedestrians, bicyclists, people inside buildings that get driven into, and parked cars. Basically, anyone who's not out in traffic in a vehicle. As you might expect, it's the total population divided by the number of people who were struck and killed.    There are some problems with the data: While the statistics clearly show a trend toward safer urban driving, they are skewed in areas with well-developed mass transit. The percentage of people who have a license and don't drive is not accounted for in the data, and would potentially skew a few areas where car use is less prevalent.              Closing thoughts  It's more than a little somber to realize that every one of these numbers was caused by the death of someone's spouse, parent, or child. Still, the data is fairly conclusive that rural driving is far more likely to kill you than urban driving -- and the FHWA has the specific breakdowns of this on its site . This data didn't look into exactly why that is, but issues like proximity to first-rate medical care and vehicle speed -- since you're not crawling along in traffic -- are likely greater factors in rural areas.   Interestingly, the number of vehicles per crash doesn't appear to bear significant correlation to how many people die in each crash. Presumably, that number is more dependent on other factors (weather, intoxication, time of day), than it is on the violence of the collision itself.

These, I submit, are among the most optimistic people on Earth, because they look at odds of 1 in 195,249,054 and still envision themselves winning.   Yet some of these people play the other side of much shorter odds, walking outside in a thunderstorm, ignoring bees buzzing flowerbeds, riding bicycles, and going for a swim, all apparently comfortable in the odds against such activities bringing them harm. They might not be so confident if they knew the true odds.

Car Crashes Versus Other Fatalities   By Matt Schmitz  October 16, 2015    Share                       <meta itemprop="width" content="1170">
                        <meta itemprop="height" content="1170">   Cars.com graphic by Paul Dolan      CARS.COM — "On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero," author Chuck Palahniuk wrote. It's true: In this life we're all basically riding in one big car together, and everyone's just getting out at different stops. Since we at Cars.com are in the business of automobiles and have a vested interest in safety, we wanted to know how fatalities from driving accidents stack up against other fatalities in terms of probability.   Related: DUI Fatalities Continue Decades-Long Slide  The answer: competitively. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, car-accident fatalities have declined by more than a third in just the past three years. This continues a long period of decline since 1985 amid motor vehicles' ever-improving structural designs and the addition of advanced safety features. Even so, death by car remains a formidable obstacle to reaching the average U.S. life expectancy of 78.8 years.  "Motor vehicle traffic" deaths in the U.S. in 2013, the most recent full year of data available, totaled 33,804, for a death rate of 10.7 per 100,000, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering deaths in the U.S. that year totaled slightly less than 2.6 million, the individual American driver's odds of dying as a result of an injury sustained in an automobile crash (which include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists involved in car crashes) come out to about 1 in 77 — making it one of the highest-probability causes of death tracked by the CDC.  That car-accident figure compares to fatalities caused by firearms (also a odds of 1 in 77), falls (1 in 83), suicide (1 in 63) and poisoning (1 in 53). By contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death, kills 1 in 4 people, accidents in general kill 1 in 20, alcohol and drugs kill 1 in 34, as does diabetes, and influenza and pneumonia kill 1 in 46. Meanwhile 1 in 161 die of homicide, 1 in 276 of skin cancer, 1 in 640 of drowning and 1 in 821 of fire.  Of those 33,804 people killed in motor-vehicle accidents, statistics show that: Occupants of the involved vehicles accounted for 8,629, with a death rate of 2.7 per 100,000 and a 1 in 301 chance of dying; pedestrians, 4,989, 1.6 death rate and a 1 in 521 chance; motorcyclists, 4,169, 1.3 death rate and a 1 in 623 chance; bicyclists, 623, 0.2 death rate and a 1 in 4,169 chance; unspecified victims, 15,388, 4.9 death rate and a 1 in 169 chance.  The top 10 states where you're most likely to die in an auto accident, including the number of deaths and death rate per 100,000 people, are:  1. Montana, 237; 23.3  2. Mississippi, 681; 22.8  3. Oklahoma, 727; 18.9  4. Alabama, 909; 18.8  5. Arkansas, 537; 18.1  6. West Virginia, 330; 17.8  7. South Dakota; 145; 17.2  8. North Dakota; 124; 17.1  9. South Carolina; 786; 16.5  10. Louisiana; 761; 16.5  The top 10 states (including the District of Columbia) where you're least likely to die in an auto accident are:  1. District of Columbia, 30; 4.6  2. Massachusetts, 375; 5.6  3. New Jersey, 564; 6.3  4. New York, 1,316; 6.7  5. Rhode Island, 77; 7.3  6. Washington, 537; 7.7  7. Utah, 230; 7.9  8. Hawaii, 112; 8.0  9. Connecticut, 300; 8.3  10. Minnesota, 466; 8.6  On the more hopeful side, despite car accidents still posing a significant risk to person's everyday lives, the roads are getting decidedly less dangerous. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, in the DOT's Fast Lane blog, noted that according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates, highway fatalities in 2014 dropped to their lowest level ever, and were likely to continue on that path in years to come.  "A recent NHTSA study shows that new vehicle safety technologies — from seat belts to electronic stability control — saved 614,000 lives," Foxx wrote. "The vehicles we drive today are loaded with technology, and they are safer than they've ever been.  "But we're not stopping there. In coming years, connected vehicle technologies like crash-avoidance systems and automated driving will very likely change the game."

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Wikimedia Commons Nuclear war. Climate change. Pandemics that kill tens of millions. These are the most viable threats to globally organized civilization. They're the stuff of nightmares and blockbusters—but unlike sea monsters or zombie viruses, they're real, part of the calculus that political leaders consider everyday. And according to a new report from the U.K.-based Global Challenges Foundation, they're much more likely than we might think. In its annual report on "global catastrophic risk," the nonprofit debuted a startling statistic: Across the span of their lives, the average American is more than five times likelier to die during a human-extinction event than in a car crash. Partly that's because the average person will probably not die in an automobile accident. Every year, one in 9,395 people die in a crash; that translates to about a 0.01 percent chance per year. But that chance compounds over the course of a lifetime. At life-long scales, one in 120 Americans die in an accident. The risk of human extinction due to climate change—or an accidental nuclear war—is much higher than that. The Stern Review , the U.K. government's premier report on the economics of climate change, estimated a 0.1 percent risk of human extinction every year. That may sound low, but it also adds up when extrapolated to century-scale. The Global Challenges Foundation estimates a 9.5 percent chance of human extinction within the next hundred years. And that number probably underestimates the risk of dying in any global cataclysm. The Stern Review, whose math suggests the 9.5-percent number, only calculated the danger of species-wide extinction. The Global Challenges Foundation's report is concerned with all events that would wipe out more than 10 percent of Earth's human population. "We don't expect any of the events that we describe to happen in any 10-year period. They might—but, on balance, they probably won't," Sebastian Farquhar, the director of the Global Priorities Project, told me. "But there's lots of events that we think are unlikely that we still prepare for." A white-tailed eagle lands on a wolf's carcass in the 30 km (19 miles) exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, in the abandoned village of Dronki, Belarus, Feb. 15, 2016. Reuters/Vasily Fedosenko For instance, most people demand working airbags in their cars and they strap in their seat-belts whenever they go for a drive, he said. We may know that the risk of an accident on any individual car ride is low, but we still believe that it makes sense to reduce possible harm. So what kind of human-level extinction events are these? The report holds catastrophic climate change and nuclear war far above the rest, and for good reason . On the latter front, it cites multiple occasions when the world stood on the brink of atomic annihilation. While most of these occurred during the Cold War, another took place during the 1990s, the most peaceful decade in recent memory: In 1995, Russian systems mistook a Norwegian weather rocket for a potential nuclear attack. Russian President Boris Yeltsin retrieved launch codes and had the nuclear suitcase open in front of him. Thankfully, Russian leaders decided the incident was a false alarm. Climate change also poses its own risks. As I've written about before, serious veterans of climate science now suggest that global warming will spawn continent-sized superstorms by the end of the century. Farquhar said that even more conservative estimates can be alarming: UN-approved climate models estimate that the risk of six to ten degrees Celsius of warming exceeds 3 percent, even if the world tamps down carbon emissions at a fast pace. "On a more plausible emissions scenario, we're looking at a 10-percent risk," Farquhar said. Few climate adaption scenarios account for swings in global temperature this enormous. Other risks won't stem from technological hubris. Any year, there's always some chance of a super-volcano erupting or an asteroid careening into the planet. Both would of course devastate the areas around ground zero—but they would also kick up dust into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and sending global temperatures plunging. (Most climate scientists agree that the same phenomenon would follow any major nuclear exchange .) Yet natural pandemics may pose the most serious risks of all. In fact, in the past two millennia, the only two events that experts can certify as global catastrophes of this scale were plagues. Workers fumigate against mosquito breeding as part of preventive measures against the Zika virus and other mosquito-borne diseases at the cemetery in Sochi Thomson Reuters The Black Death of the 1340s felled more than 10 percent of the world population. Eight centuries prior, another epidemic of the Yersinia pestis bacterium —the "Great Plague of Justinian" in 541 and 542—killed between 25 and 33 million people, or between 13 and 17 percent of the global population at that time. No event approached these totals in the 20 th century. The twin wars did not come close: About 1 percent of the global population perished in the Great War, about 3 percent in World War II. Only the Spanish flu epidemic of the late 1910s, which killed between 2.5 and 5 percent of the world's people, approached the medieval plagues. Farquhar said there's some evidence that the First World War and Spanish influenza were the same catastrophic global event—but even then, the death toll only came to about 6 percent of humanity. The report briefly explores other possible risks: a genetically engineered pandemic, geo-engineering gone awry, an all-seeing artificial intelligence. Unlike nuclear war or global warming, though, the report clarifies that these remain mostly notional threats, even as it cautions: [N]early all of the most threatening global catastrophic risks were unforeseeable a few decades before they became apparent. Forty years before the discovery of the nuclear bomb, few could have predicted that nuclear weapons would come to be one of the leading global catastrophic risks. Immediately after the Second World War, few could have known that catastrophic climate change, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence would come to pose such a significant threat. So what's the societal version of an airbag and seatbelt? Farquhar conceded that many existential risks were best handled by policies catered to the specific issue, like reducing stockpiles of warheads or cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. But civilization could generally increase its resilience if it developed technology to rapidly accelerate food production. If technical society had the power to ramp-up less sunlight-dependent food sources, especially, there would be a "lower chance that a particulate winter [from a volcano or nuclear war] would have catastrophic consequences." He also thought many problems could be helped if democratic institutions had some kind of ombudsman or committee to represent the interests of future generations. (This strikes me as a distinctly European proposal—in the United States, the national politics of a "representative of future generations" would be thrown off by the abortion debate and unborn personhood, I think.)

At Best Health Degrees we decided to take a look at just how much you increase your chances of dying through these activities.  Life after all is one big series of risks.  And some risks are worth the shot. One study
shows people have a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying while attending a dance party. Another
study shows the odds of dying while skydiving in the United States is 1 in 101,083
jumps. What follows is a list of activities, from the ordinary to the extraordinary, and
your chances of dying from them. Sports and Recreational Activities  Overall, snow boarding fatality rate: 0.455 per million participant visits.

third weekend for two days for a year are: 35 days/year x 2.5 deaths/year / 37,500
climber-days/year or 1/429 (John Dill, article about death and injury in Yosemite 1970
through 1990). The mortality rates among trekkers in Nepal during two periods between 1984 and 1991:
0.014 and 0.015 per 100 trekkers. On Denali, the highest mountain in Alaska: 0.308 deaths for every 100 mountaineers who
register with the National Park Service. On Mt. Rainier: Estimated mortality rate of approximately 0.031 per 100 mountaineers. Climbing above 6000 m in the Himalayas: 10 to 12.6 deaths for every 100 mountaineers. (Source for all five activities: Postgraduate Medical Journal ) Mortality rate while mountaineering in Mt McKinley National Park, United States: 100

Women who smoke are 12 times more likely to die from the disease. Smoking triples the
risk of dying from heart disease among middle-aged men and women. People who smoke
increase their risk of death from emphysema and bronchitis by almost 10 times. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Lifelong smokers on average have a 50 percent chance of dying from tobacco-related
illnesses, with half of them dying before the age of 70. Studies show cigar smokers have
4-10 times the risk of nonsmokers of dying from laryngeal, oral, or esophageal cancers. (Source: Oral Cancer Foundation ) People who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and
14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for people who had never
been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration

of obesity (more than 15 years) (Source: Monash University researchers ) Miscellaneous  Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying Table games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying Computer games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying

Psychology, School of Human Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Henry
Cotton Campus, Webster St., Liverpool, L3 2ET, England ). Whatever the odds of a person dying during the next year it will be twice as large 8
years from now according to British actuary Benjamin Gompertz in 1825; it's called
the "Gompertz Law of human mortality." Your probability of dying during a given year
doubles every 8 years.        This page may be out of date. Save your draft before refreshing this page. Submit any pending changes before refreshing this page.  Hide this message .

Multiple countries, every state Answered Oct 18, 2017 · Author has 6.4k answers and 4.2m answer views Rounds to 0%, which is why humans make such bad drivers. ~0% * large number == large chance of a crash over your lifetime. Making 0% a smaller 0% would greatly affect the chance of a crash. But since the number is already 0%, the human brain assumes we are safe, even when provably not so. 5 per billion miles is right for fatalities. So then you need to look at the rate of reported crashes (assumed to be large value or injury of any kind), and around here it’s about 33:1 crash to fatality. So local to me, you’d expect 165 crashes per billion miles. I have no idea if that number would be applicable around the world, and the statistics aren’t uniformly kept for non-fatal crashes as they are for fatal ones. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Michael Fernandez promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo Quora User , Marketing Answered Dec 4, 2011 · Author has 4.1k answers and 5.8m answer views Not exactly what you wanted, this is fatalities data. This is UK data from the 1990-1999. The US drives about 50% more km per year, and I think the US also has more auto journeys, which drops the rate. (It is mostly the journeys you start drunk that cause problems...and there aren't too many other drunks on the road before 5 pm) The "serious" accident rate for cars is about 5-10 X the fatality rate. That number keeps going up as cars are improved. Actual crashes with police reports are about 100 X the fatality rate for the U.S., becuase a police report is required for insurance pay outs. >>> The best SWAG for what you want is about 10 X the UK car journey fatality rate of 40 per billion journeys.  That would be about 400 per billion journeys for the U.S.  <<< Source... http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/tow...

The most impressive part is there was about a 500 to 1 difference between the rate on a clear day between 10 am and 2pm and the rate for midnight -4 am in bad weather. The daytime, clear weather, low traffic, sober driver in suburbs or rural areas had fatality rates comparable to commercial US airline travel. From a different set of data, there was a comparison of single car accident rates for various car models. There was about a 2.5 X difference between Mercedes Benz S class and E class cars with the same chassis - only difference is the larger engine and higher price in the S class. S class are bought by people in a hurry, or players, or whatever....but for the almost exactly the same car, the S class drivers run off the road (single car accident) 2.5 times more often ;-) More info.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tra... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epi... http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/facts... 10.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

These, I submit, are among the most optimistic people on Earth, because they look at odds of 1 in 195,249,054 and still envision themselves winning.

What kind of car? What weather conditions? How many vehicles were involved? We’re the occupents wearing their safety belts? There variable are nearly endless. I will say this, there have been accidents where a person accelerated to a maximum of 10 miles per hour and hit a pole in a parking lot and died while another person was thrown from a car going 170 miles per hour across the pavement and lived. There is no set statistic to calculate without knowing the person, vehicle and the entire situation and scenario. One good thing is that every year vehicle safety devices are getting better with new designs and innovations that increase the survivability of even the most horrendous car accident. 352 Views Related Questions More Answers Below What are the odds of surviving a head-on car crash at high speed?

Answered Jul 4, 2016 · Author has 4.4k answers and 6.4m answer views From Wikipedia From 1979 to 2005, the number of deaths per year decreased 14.97% while the number of deaths per capita decreased by 35.46%. In 2010, there were an estimated 5,419,000 crashes (30,296 fatal crashes), killing 32,999 and injuring 2,239,000. The 32,479 traffic fatalities in 2011 were the lowest in 62 years (1949). Given 5,419,000 crashes of which only 30,296 caused fatalities, ignoring details such as the number of passengers per car, pedestrian deaths etc, we can estimate that the probability of surviving a car crash in 2010 was 99.994% and is likely to be much the same today. With extremely rare exceptions one could say that car crashes are generally survivable, which makes sense given that statistically most crashes are fender-benders with no personal injury, not high-speed writeoffs. 2.8k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Or overdue.  By car insurance industry estimates, you will file a claim for a collision about once every 17.9 years. That’s if you’re an average driver, which, whether you’re willing to admit it or not, you likely are.    So if you got your license at age 16, the odds are quite good that you’ll experience some kind of crash by the time you’re 34, at the latest. Over the course of a typical long, driving lifetime, you should have a total of three to four accidents.  Chances are these crashes won’t be deadly. There are about 10 million accidents of all kinds each year, from parking lot scrapes to multi-car pileups, according to the National Safety Council; in 2009, just three of every 1,000 of those accidents involved fatalities.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.

Turns out it varies wildly, depending on where you live.   To get an overarching look at how deadly the roads are in all 50 states, plus DC, we combined government data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. (Check out the table at the end to see the raw numbers for yourself.) Here's every state, ranked by how likely you are to be killed in a car crash, plus some other terrifying factoids. Hint: be careful when you're out walking around in Florida.

Well, probably because the freeways are so damn awful, people drive less: with an average of 8,697 miles per driver per year, people stay away from the the known horrors of the streets.              50. Massachusetts   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/20,530  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/11,421  Total population: 6,692,824  Total licensed drivers: 4,765,586  Total number of deaths in 2013: 326 With just 1.05 vehicles per licensed driver, Massachusetts has among the fewest cars per capita in the country.    49. New Jersey   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,419  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/7,772  Total population: 8,899,339  Total licensed drivers: 6,081,386  Total number of deaths in 2013: 542 This one really shouldn't be all that surprising, given the number of people who take trains into NYC every day.    48. New York   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/16,390  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/8,860  Total population: 19,651,127  Total licensed drivers: 11,210,723  Total number of deaths in 2013: 1,199 The average New York driver actually drives a little bit more (12,154 miles) than the national average each year, though only 70% of all New Yorkers over the age of 16 actually have a license, and there's less than one car per licensed driver.              47.

Alaska   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,414  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,870  Total population: 735,132  Total licensed drivers: 528,873  Total number of deaths in 2013: 51 How many miles does the average Alaskan vehicle see in a year? It's 6,169. Of course, that could also be the height in inches of annual snowfall, so there's a reasonably correlative relationship here.              44. Minnesota   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/14,006  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,523  Total population: 5,420,380  Total licensed drivers: 3,330,725  Total number of deaths in 2013: 387 Despite having more roads than all but four states, Minnesotans are among the least likely to get their licenses. Those that do, though, rack up over 17,000 mile per year, and are among the most likely to slam into someone else.    43. Hawaii   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,765  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,951  Total population: 1,404,054  Total licensed drivers: 915,033  Total number of deaths in 2013: 102 Hawaii has the fewest miles of road of any state in the union, and it's also among the roughest. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii has the fewest miles of road per fatal crash (48) of any state.              42. Utah   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/13,186  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,778  Total population: 2,900,872  Total licensed drivers: 1,661,219  Total number of deaths in 2013: 220 With 16,256 miles per driver, you might expect Utah to have more than 46,254 miles of road. Then again, one of the prime allures of the state is what you can do without roads.                   Share on Facebook      Pin it         Flickr/Ilirjan Rrumbullaku      41.

Illinois   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,999  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,390  Total population: 12,882,135  Total licensed drivers: 8,261,582  Total number of deaths in 2013: 991 Even with the fourth most roads in the country, Illinoisans (Illini?) are actually pretty good about not putting themselves in life-threatening situations.    39.

Maryland   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,750  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,480  Total population: 5,928,814  Total licensed drivers: 4,140,105  Total number of deaths in 2013: 465 Cars in Maryland see 14,787 miles each year, despite having just 32,422 miles of road in the state. That probably speaks to the nightmare of commuting from the outskirts of DC more than anything else, but there's still less than one car per driver for the entire state.    37. Oregon   Probability of dying in a car crash: 1/12,556  Probability of being involved in a fatal car crash: 1/6,189  Total population: 3,930,065  Total licensed drivers: 2,773,373  Total number of deaths in 2013: 313 Oregon likes to consider itself a bicycle-friendly state, and with just 55 fatalities among people not inside a moving vehicle, there might very well be something to that.

In other words, people in Ohio are statistically less likely to hit stationary objects.    35.

They combine for among the fewest cars involved per accident of any state. Which means a lot of single car accidents, and collisions with stationary objects. Go figure?              28.

Simply put, it's because the average Oklahoman drives so much every year that death rate for drivers is the second highest in the country.              5.

Yet somehow, with just 1.31 vehicles involved per collision, it's the state where drivers are most likely to hit stationary objects. And yes, that also means it's on par with Florida for hitting pedestrians.                         Share on Facebook      Pin it        Aaron Miller/Thrillist     About the data  The data used here is from both the NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System , and the FHWA .    The ranking itself is actually very basic: it's the total population of each state divided by the number of people killed in automotive accidents for the given year (2013).   The rest of the data involved, however, is where things get interesting:    Being Involved in a fatal crash : The NHTSA keeps such thorough accounts of every fatality accident that we know exactly how many people were in each vehicle for every single crash. Since surviving such an incident is inarguably a horrific and traumatizing experience, dividing the total population by the number of crashes is a sobering way to realize just how fragile life can be.    Being involved, as a driver: Simply put, the more you drive, the higher your chances of being involved in an incident. We took the population of licensed drivers and divided by the total number of accidents.              Dying in a crash, as a driver: Similar to being involved in a crash, because the NHTSA actually notes who was injured or killed while sitting where in a vehicle, we were able to calculate the odds of dying as a driver by dividing the licensed population by the number of people who died while driving.    Dying while you're not even in a moving vehicle: This includes pedestrians, bicyclists, people inside buildings that get driven into, and parked cars. Basically, anyone who's not out in traffic in a vehicle. As you might expect, it's the total population divided by the number of people who were struck and killed.    There are some problems with the data: While the statistics clearly show a trend toward safer urban driving, they are skewed in areas with well-developed mass transit. The percentage of people who have a license and don't drive is not accounted for in the data, and would potentially skew a few areas where car use is less prevalent.              Closing thoughts  It's more than a little somber to realize that every one of these numbers was caused by the death of someone's spouse, parent, or child. Still, the data is fairly conclusive that rural driving is far more likely to kill you than urban driving -- and the FHWA has the specific breakdowns of this on its site . This data didn't look into exactly why that is, but issues like proximity to first-rate medical care and vehicle speed -- since you're not crawling along in traffic -- are likely greater factors in rural areas.   Interestingly, the number of vehicles per crash doesn't appear to bear significant correlation to how many people die in each crash. Presumably, that number is more dependent on other factors (weather, intoxication, time of day), than it is on the violence of the collision itself.

These, I submit, are among the most optimistic people on Earth, because they look at odds of 1 in 195,249,054 and still envision themselves winning.   Yet some of these people play the other side of much shorter odds, walking outside in a thunderstorm, ignoring bees buzzing flowerbeds, riding bicycles, and going for a swim, all apparently comfortable in the odds against such activities bringing them harm. They might not be so confident if they knew the true odds.

It's true: In this life we're all basically riding in one big car together, and everyone's just getting out at different stops. Since we at Cars.com are in the business of automobiles and have a vested interest in safety, we wanted to know how fatalities from driving accidents stack up against other fatalities in terms of probability.   Related: DUI Fatalities Continue Decades-Long Slide  The answer: competitively. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, car-accident fatalities have declined by more than a third in just the past three years. This continues a long period of decline since 1985 amid motor vehicles' ever-improving structural designs and the addition of advanced safety features. Even so, death by car remains a formidable obstacle to reaching the average U.S. life expectancy of 78.8 years.  "Motor vehicle traffic" deaths in the U.S. in 2013, the most recent full year of data available, totaled 33,804, for a death rate of 10.7 per 100,000, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering deaths in the U.S. that year totaled slightly less than 2.6 million, the individual American driver's odds of dying as a result of an injury sustained in an automobile crash (which include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists involved in car crashes) come out to about 1 in 77 — making it one of the highest-probability causes of death tracked by the CDC.  That car-accident figure compares to fatalities caused by firearms (also a odds of 1 in 77), falls (1 in 83), suicide (1 in 63) and poisoning (1 in 53). By contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death, kills 1 in 4 people, accidents in general kill 1 in 20, alcohol and drugs kill 1 in 34, as does diabetes, and influenza and pneumonia kill 1 in 46. Meanwhile 1 in 161 die of homicide, 1 in 276 of skin cancer, 1 in 640 of drowning and 1 in 821 of fire.  Of those 33,804 people killed in motor-vehicle accidents, statistics show that: Occupants of the involved vehicles accounted for 8,629, with a death rate of 2.7 per 100,000 and a 1 in 301 chance of dying; pedestrians, 4,989, 1.6 death rate and a 1 in 521 chance; motorcyclists, 4,169, 1.3 death rate and a 1 in 623 chance; bicyclists, 623, 0.2 death rate and a 1 in 4,169 chance; unspecified victims, 15,388, 4.9 death rate and a 1 in 169 chance.  The top 10 states where you're most likely to die in an auto accident, including the number of deaths and death rate per 100,000 people, are:  1. Montana, 237; 23.3  2. Mississippi, 681; 22.8  3. Oklahoma, 727; 18.9  4. Alabama, 909; 18.8  5. Arkansas, 537; 18.1  6. West Virginia, 330; 17.8  7. South Dakota; 145; 17.2  8. North Dakota; 124; 17.1  9. South Carolina; 786; 16.5  10. Louisiana; 761; 16.5  The top 10 states (including the District of Columbia) where you're least likely to die in an auto accident are:  1. District of Columbia, 30; 4.6  2. Massachusetts, 375; 5.6  3. New Jersey, 564; 6.3  4. New York, 1,316; 6.7  5. Rhode Island, 77; 7.3  6. Washington, 537; 7.7  7. Utah, 230; 7.9  8. Hawaii, 112; 8.0  9. Connecticut, 300; 8.3  10. Minnesota, 466; 8.6  On the more hopeful side, despite car accidents still posing a significant risk to person's everyday lives, the roads are getting decidedly less dangerous. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, in the DOT's Fast Lane blog, noted that according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates, highway fatalities in 2014 dropped to their lowest level ever, and were likely to continue on that path in years to come.  "A recent NHTSA study shows that new vehicle safety technologies — from seat belts to electronic stability control — saved 614,000 lives," Foxx wrote. "The vehicles we drive today are loaded with technology, and they are safer than they've ever been.  "But we're not stopping there. In coming years, connected vehicle technologies like crash-avoidance systems and automated driving will very likely change the game."

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

Wikimedia Commons Nuclear war. Climate change. Pandemics that kill tens of millions. These are the most viable threats to globally organized civilization. They're the stuff of nightmares and blockbusters—but unlike sea monsters or zombie viruses, they're real, part of the calculus that political leaders consider everyday. And according to a new report from the U.K.-based Global Challenges Foundation, they're much more likely than we might think. In its annual report on "global catastrophic risk," the nonprofit debuted a startling statistic: Across the span of their lives, the average American is more than five times likelier to die during a human-extinction event than in a car crash. Partly that's because the average person will probably not die in an automobile accident. Every year, one in 9,395 people die in a crash; that translates to about a 0.01 percent chance per year. But that chance compounds over the course of a lifetime. At life-long scales, one in 120 Americans die in an accident. The risk of human extinction due to climate change—or an accidental nuclear war—is much higher than that. The Stern Review , the U.K. government's premier report on the economics of climate change, estimated a 0.1 percent risk of human extinction every year. That may sound low, but it also adds up when extrapolated to century-scale. The Global Challenges Foundation estimates a 9.5 percent chance of human extinction within the next hundred years. And that number probably underestimates the risk of dying in any global cataclysm. The Stern Review, whose math suggests the 9.5-percent number, only calculated the danger of species-wide extinction. The Global Challenges Foundation's report is concerned with all events that would wipe out more than 10 percent of Earth's human population. "We don't expect any of the events that we describe to happen in any 10-year period. They might—but, on balance, they probably won't," Sebastian Farquhar, the director of the Global Priorities Project, told me. "But there's lots of events that we think are unlikely that we still prepare for." A white-tailed eagle lands on a wolf's carcass in the 30 km (19 miles) exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, in the abandoned village of Dronki, Belarus, Feb. 15, 2016. Reuters/Vasily Fedosenko For instance, most people demand working airbags in their cars and they strap in their seat-belts whenever they go for a drive, he said. We may know that the risk of an accident on any individual car ride is low, but we still believe that it makes sense to reduce possible harm. So what kind of human-level extinction events are these? The report holds catastrophic climate change and nuclear war far above the rest, and for good reason . On the latter front, it cites multiple occasions when the world stood on the brink of atomic annihilation. While most of these occurred during the Cold War, another took place during the 1990s, the most peaceful decade in recent memory: In 1995, Russian systems mistook a Norwegian weather rocket for a potential nuclear attack. Russian President Boris Yeltsin retrieved launch codes and had the nuclear suitcase open in front of him. Thankfully, Russian leaders decided the incident was a false alarm. Climate change also poses its own risks. As I've written about before, serious veterans of climate science now suggest that global warming will spawn continent-sized superstorms by the end of the century. Farquhar said that even more conservative estimates can be alarming: UN-approved climate models estimate that the risk of six to ten degrees Celsius of warming exceeds 3 percent, even if the world tamps down carbon emissions at a fast pace. "On a more plausible emissions scenario, we're looking at a 10-percent risk," Farquhar said. Few climate adaption scenarios account for swings in global temperature this enormous. Other risks won't stem from technological hubris. Any year, there's always some chance of a super-volcano erupting or an asteroid careening into the planet. Both would of course devastate the areas around ground zero—but they would also kick up dust into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and sending global temperatures plunging. (Most climate scientists agree that the same phenomenon would follow any major nuclear exchange .) Yet natural pandemics may pose the most serious risks of all. In fact, in the past two millennia, the only two events that experts can certify as global catastrophes of this scale were plagues. Workers fumigate against mosquito breeding as part of preventive measures against the Zika virus and other mosquito-borne diseases at the cemetery in Sochi Thomson Reuters The Black Death of the 1340s felled more than 10 percent of the world population. Eight centuries prior, another epidemic of the Yersinia pestis bacterium —the "Great Plague of Justinian" in 541 and 542—killed between 25 and 33 million people, or between 13 and 17 percent of the global population at that time. No event approached these totals in the 20 th century. The twin wars did not come close: About 1 percent of the global population perished in the Great War, about 3 percent in World War II. Only the Spanish flu epidemic of the late 1910s, which killed between 2.5 and 5 percent of the world's people, approached the medieval plagues. Farquhar said there's some evidence that the First World War and Spanish influenza were the same catastrophic global event—but even then, the death toll only came to about 6 percent of humanity. The report briefly explores other possible risks: a genetically engineered pandemic, geo-engineering gone awry, an all-seeing artificial intelligence. Unlike nuclear war or global warming, though, the report clarifies that these remain mostly notional threats, even as it cautions: [N]early all of the most threatening global catastrophic risks were unforeseeable a few decades before they became apparent. Forty years before the discovery of the nuclear bomb, few could have predicted that nuclear weapons would come to be one of the leading global catastrophic risks. Immediately after the Second World War, few could have known that catastrophic climate change, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence would come to pose such a significant threat. So what's the societal version of an airbag and seatbelt? Farquhar conceded that many existential risks were best handled by policies catered to the specific issue, like reducing stockpiles of warheads or cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. But civilization could generally increase its resilience if it developed technology to rapidly accelerate food production. If technical society had the power to ramp-up less sunlight-dependent food sources, especially, there would be a "lower chance that a particulate winter [from a volcano or nuclear war] would have catastrophic consequences." He also thought many problems could be helped if democratic institutions had some kind of ombudsman or committee to represent the interests of future generations. (This strikes me as a distinctly European proposal—in the United States, the national politics of a "representative of future generations" would be thrown off by the abortion debate and unborn personhood, I think.) The report was a joint project of the Centre for Effective Altruism in London and the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford. It can be read online .

From: Best Health Care Degrees      Your Chances of Dying  The National Center for Health Statistics reports the average life expectancy in the
United States is 77.9 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
the leading causes of death in the United States are (in descending order) heart disease,
cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, Alzheimer's disease and
diabetes. (ref: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm ) There are so many ways to die early; from risky outdoor activities to smoking.  At Best Health Degrees we decided to take a look at just how much you increase your chances of dying through these activities.  Life after all is one big series of risks.  And some risks are worth the shot. One study
shows people have a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying while attending a dance party. Another
study shows the odds of dying while skydiving in the United States is 1 in 101,083
jumps. What follows is a list of activities, from the ordinary to the extraordinary, and
your chances of dying from them. Sports and Recreational Activities  Overall, snow boarding fatality rate: 0.455 per million participant visits.

third weekend for two days for a year are: 35 days/year x 2.5 deaths/year / 37,500
climber-days/year or 1/429 (John Dill, article about death and injury in Yosemite 1970
through 1990). The mortality rates among trekkers in Nepal during two periods between 1984 and 1991:
0.014 and 0.015 per 100 trekkers. On Denali, the highest mountain in Alaska: 0.308 deaths for every 100 mountaineers who
register with the National Park Service. On Mt. Rainier: Estimated mortality rate of approximately 0.031 per 100 mountaineers. Climbing above 6000 m in the Himalayas: 10 to 12.6 deaths for every 100 mountaineers.

Women who smoke are 12 times more likely to die from the disease. Smoking triples the
risk of dying from heart disease among middle-aged men and women. People who smoke
increase their risk of death from emphysema and bronchitis by almost 10 times. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Lifelong smokers on average have a 50 percent chance of dying from tobacco-related
illnesses, with half of them dying before the age of 70. Studies show cigar smokers have
4-10 times the risk of nonsmokers of dying from laryngeal, oral, or esophageal cancers. (Source: Oral Cancer Foundation ) People who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and
14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for people who had never
been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration

of obesity (more than 15 years) (Source: Monash University researchers ) Miscellaneous  Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying Table games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying Computer games: 1 in 100 million chance of dying

years from now according to British actuary Benjamin Gompertz in 1825; it's called
the "Gompertz Law of human mortality." Your probability of dying during a given year
doubles every 8 years.        This page may be out of date. Save your draft before refreshing this page. Submit any pending changes before refreshing this page.  Hide this message .

Multiple countries, every state Answered Oct 18, 2017 · Author has 6.4k answers and 4.2m answer views Rounds to 0%, which is why humans make such bad drivers. ~0% * large number == large chance of a crash over your lifetime. Making 0% a smaller 0% would greatly affect the chance of a crash. But since the number is already 0%, the human brain assumes we are safe, even when provably not so. 5 per billion miles is right for fatalities. So then you need to look at the rate of reported crashes (assumed to be large value or injury of any kind), and around here it’s about 33:1 crash to fatality. So local to me, you’d expect 165 crashes per billion miles. I have no idea if that number would be applicable around the world, and the statistics aren’t uniformly kept for non-fatal crashes as they are for fatal ones. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Michael Fernandez promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

The US drives about 50% more km per year, and I think the US also has more auto journeys, which drops the rate. (It is mostly the journeys you start drunk that cause problems...and there aren't too many other drunks on the road before 5 pm) The "serious" accident rate for cars is about 5-10 X the fatality rate. That number keeps going up as cars are improved. Actual crashes with police reports are about 100 X the fatality rate for the U.S., becuase a police report is required for insurance pay outs. >>> The best SWAG for what you want is about 10 X the UK car journey fatality rate of 40 per billion journeys.  That would be about 400 per billion journeys for the U.S.  <<< Source... http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/tow...
