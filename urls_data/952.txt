Saunders and Michael C. Horowitz   by Elizabeth N. Saunders and Michael C. Horowitz   January 3       This undated photo distributed Sept. 16 by the North Korean government purports to show Kim Jong Un, right, celebrating what was said to be the test launch of an intermediate-range missile. (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)   On Tuesday night, in response to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s claim to have a nuclear button on his desk , President Trump tweeted , “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”  This is not the first time that things have gotten personal in the U.S.-North Korea standoff. Much of the rhetoric between the two leaders and media commentary about the risk of war focuses on the leadership of Trump and Kim — or “Little Rocket Man,” as Trump has called the North Korean leader.  But how much could these two singular leaders really propel us to a nuclear war? Trump’s tweets and other actions certainly can increase the risk of conflict — consistent with our  research on how the decisions of individual leaders affect military conflict.           However, in this case, other factors, including geography and military capabilities, will matter more than tweets or the characteristics of leaders. And these factors reduce the likelihood of war .  Leaders can be important for international conflict  For the past few generations, political scientists who write about the outbreak of conflict mainly argued that leaders were irrelevant , focusing instead on international factors such as great power relations or domestic political factors such as whether the two countries involved had democratic institutions .  But more and more scholarship  suggests that leaders make a large difference in determining whether and how countries go to war. And it’s not just in dictatorships such as that of North Korea; even more constrained leaders, such as U.S. presidents, matter . Leaders’ beliefs and experiences before coming into office can be critical in determining whether a country goes to war and what military strategy will be used in the event of war.  But structural forces are strong in this case  Even if leaders have discretion, they are constrained by material and situational constraints. No U.S. or North Korean leader can realistically change or avoid some of these constraints.  One constraint stems from the two sides’ formidable military capabilities, which mean that a general war with North Korea would be devastating , as Barry Posen argued last year. Even before North Korea acquired a nuclear capability, its artillery put tremendous pressure on South Korea. Add to that its missile arsenal — which, as nuclear experts have chronicled , can now probably deliver an intercontinental ballistic missile armed with a nuclear warhead against the United States .           A second unavoidable constraint is geography, which may make war less likely. North Korean artillery points directly at Seoul, just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone (DMZ). South Korea may oppose a war, which could influence U.S. behavior. North Korea also borders China, a powerful country whose economic support keeps North Korea afloat.  But China faces its own geographic reality with respect to North Korea , and China is increasingly frustrated with North Korea’s behavior. In the event of war, China does not want refugees flooding across the border into China. Yet China also does not want a unified Korean Peninsula with U.S. troops on its border.  Indeed, in the Korean War, the United States tested geographic constraints by pushing beyond the prewar dividing line, the 38th parallel, in an attempt to unify Korea. China intervened to prevent such an outcome, and the conflict stopped where it started.  All sides know that a war would be a huge and difficult military and political problem. So there are strong incentives to try to deter the other side, rather than escalate.  U.S. and North Korean leaders have reason to make war even less likely  Although the focus on Trump and Kim almost always suggests that their behavior increases the risk of war, they actually have strong incentives to reduce the prospect of war.  Despite rhetoric about North Korea’s irrationality, Kim’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles was rational . He wants to stay in power, and nuclear weapons constitute invasion insurance. But a war probably would spell the end of the regime, giving North Korea little reason to start a war.  On the U.S. side, few wars probably have been war-gamed more than a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. U.S. decision-makers know how costly a war might be . Knowledge of these costs makes war less likely.  A leader-driven war would have to overcome strong structural pressures  If “leaders matter” for military decision-making, then with different leaders, we might get a different outcome. So what about Trump and Kim might lead to conflict?  One factor from Trump’s side could be risk acceptance . Trump could decide that he wants to start a war despite the costs, and count on U.S. missile defenses to shoot down North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launches and protect the homeland (an awfully big gamble ). In theory, Trump’s lack of experience also could make him less cognizant of the costs of war and less able to draw on his more experienced advisers .  From Kim’s side, studies suggest that dictators — who face fewer checks and balances — are more risk-acceptant . With fewer people to tell them no, they are more likely to escalate in general.  If war occurs, one pathway is through a misreading of one side’s incentives by the other. For example, Kim’s desire to stay in power could lead Trump to believe that, even in the face of limited U.S. strikes against North Korean nuclear and missile facilities, Kim will back down instead of escalate. But it would be hard to credibly signal that those strikes would be limited, and if Kim believes the United States is coming after him, escalation becomes more likely.  Of course, war could also come via miscalculation and, eventually, some kind of preemptive strike. But research suggests that war spirals of that sort are extremely rare .  In war, as in elections, the fundamentals matter  Many questions in political science and history boil down to this: Do individuals or structural forces shape events?  Although recent evidence in international relations scholarship points to the importance of leaders, the North Korean standoff reminds us of the power of structural factors. That may provide some comfort to those who read the president’s tweet on Tuesday night and worried about the risk of war.  Michael C.

On 25 January, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the hands of the symbolic Doomsday Clock forward to two minutes to midnight. The Doomsday Clock was devised at the end of World War II and midnight on the clock represents a nuclear disaster or apocalyptic event. The closer the Doomsday Clock moves to midnight, the more real the threat is. READ NEXT: What is Doomsday Clock? Donald Trump’s proximity to the USA’s arsenal of some 6,800 nuclear warheads moved the clock to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight in 2017. Now, with the stand-off between the US and North Korea escalating, the threat feels even more real and, alongside the ever-present danger of climate change, worsened by irrational decisions made by President Trump, the organisation advanced the clock forward a further thirty seconds for 2018. This a long way from 1991, where the end of the Cold War meant we were a figurative 17 minutes away. READ NEXT: What is a hydrogen bomb? Most recently, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took to state TV/Twitter to boast about the size of their respective nuclear buttons. Kim Jong-un boasted his button was on his desk and he had completed his nuclear arsenal, which led Trump to retaliate with claims his button is "bigger and more powerful." North Korea fired a missile over Japan last year, causing emergency alarms to ring out across the country. The missile landed in the sea off Hokkaido and South Korea's military is said to have fired back in response. The US condemned the test and the UN Security Council met to discuss the ongoing threat. READ NEXT: How Donald Trump’s views on nukes have gone backwards over time At the end of August, state media in North Korea claimed Kim Jong-un successfully tested a nuclear weapon that could be attached to a long-range missile. The weapon is also claimed to have been a hydrogen bomb more powerful than the atomic weapons dropped during the Second World War and is said to be small enough to fit onto a missile. READ NEXT: A guide to Kim Jong-un’s nuclear weapons Before this recent escalation, there had been more than 2,055 known nuclear detonations – but only two of those were in an actual conflict: the bombs dropped by the USA on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Time hasn’t stood still, so what would happen if a thin-skinned world leader were to aim one of those nukes at a city today? If you’re having a cheery day, you probably don’t want to press play on the video below from AsapSCIENCE. And you certainly don’t want to read my summary either, but for everyone else, here are the gritty details. Video of What If We Have A Nuclear War? For simplicity, AsapSCIENCE has taken a one-megaton nuclear bomb as its weapon of choice. That’s 66 times larger than the bomb that devastated Hiroshima, which may seem far-fetched until you realise that it’s like an underwhelming indoor firework compared to the 50-megaton Tsar bomb that Russia dropped on Mityushikha Bay in 1961, which released the nuclear energy of 3,333 Hiroshima bombs. READ NEXT: In a nuclear apocalypse, hair conditioner could be your downfall So, what damage would this one-megaton bomb do? How long is an incomprehensibly destructive piece of string? In short, it depends on a number of factors, including the time of day, the weather, the type of land where it hits, or if it detonates in the air. But there simply isn’t a happy answer to the question, no matter how favourable the conditions. This so-called " Nuke Map ", created by Alex Wellerstein, gives a more accurate idea. It lets you virtually drop a bomb anywhere in the world and you can select the strength of the bomb in question to see the extent of the damage.  There is also an app called Nukey McNukeface (really), designed for Android, that will reveal if you're in North Korea's nuclear strike zone. Nukey shows you a 100km radius from major US and world capitals, but the designer admits that the app is 100% accurate "and is merely for fun". Data and ranges are said to be based on news reports. Around a third of the energy of an atomic bomb is released through thermal radiation. This travels at around the speed of light, so the first thing you’ll see is a blinding flash of light and heat. For a one-megaton bomb, you’ll likely be temporarily blinded if you were standing 13 miles away on a clear day, or 53 miles away on a clear night. Still, temporary blindness aside, you would escape the more serious health complaints: if you were standing seven miles away, you might need to be treated for mild first-degree burns. Stand within five miles of the blast zone, and you’re looking at more serious third-degree burns.  There’s a good chance that would be fatal, but not as good a chance as if you were closer to the blast zone itself. The centre of the Hiroshima bomb was estimated to be around 300,000˚C. For perspective, cremations are carried out in furnaces that reach 1,200˚C, so there’s literally no chance of surviving that. Your chances improve the further out you get, basically, but even if you get serious burns, you may be killed another way before you can be treated. Within a four-mile radius of a one-megaton bomb, blast waves can produce 180 tonnes of force and winds of around 158 miles per hour. That speed reaches 470mph in a half-mile radius. As a human, you might survive that pressure – but you likely wouldn’t survive any nearby buildings collapsing on you. That’s before we even get on to the radiation poisoning. Radiation of 600 REM has a 90% chance of death. That drops by half when you hit 450 REM, but you’re not out of the woods then, with increased chances of cancer and potential genetic mutations. But let’s say you’re not anywhere near the blast. You’re safe then, right? Well, not quite. Overlooking the fact that it wouldn’t be a nuclear war without retaliation, radioactive fallout can travel for hundreds of miles. Yes, its effects diminish after a couple of weeks, but that’s a couple of weeks when you’re going to want to stay in your fallout shelter. What do you mean you don’t have a fallout shelter?

Mesmerising and harrowing map shows every major nuclear explosion in history Again, that’s just a single-megaton bomb, and nukes are a little like Pringles: not only are they potentially deadly – you can’t have just one. A 2007 study examined what would happen if India and Pakistan engaged in a small-scale nuclear war of their own. Small-scale because, comparatively, both nations have fairly small arsenals of around 250 (remember, Russia and the USA have nearly 14,000 between them). The conclusion of this study? With “just” 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs, 20 million would immediately die, five million tonnes of smoke would hit the stratosphere, and we’d enter nuclear winter. Global temperatures drop and agriculture would struggle causing famine and yet more deaths. A 2012 study projected that a 100-bomb nuclear war would cause two billion people to starve. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule. One Japanese man managed to survive being caught in both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs . He eventually died in 2010, aged 93. All the same, there are plenty of reasons to be alarmed when the American president is quoted as welcoming a nuclear arms race . When it comes to nuclear wars, it’s not the case that the side with the biggest arsenal wins – more that everybody loses.

By  Yochi Dreazen    Sep 28, 2017,  9:00am EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Former NATO military chief: there’s a 10% chance of nuclear war with North Korea      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images     Retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis spent 37 years in the military, including four years as the supreme allied commander of NATO. Hillary Clinton vetted him as a possible running mate. President-elect Donald Trump considered naming him secretary of state. He is a serious man, and about as far from an armchair pundit as it’s possible to be.  And that’s precisely what makes his assessment of the escalating standoff with North Korea so jarring. Stavridis believes there’s at least a 10 percent chance of a nuclear war between the US and North Korea, and a 20 to 30 percent chance of a conventional, but still bloody, conflict.  “I think we are closer to a significant exchange of ordnance than we have been since the end of the Cold War on the Korean peninsula,” he said during a panel I moderated Tuesday at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perry World House .  His estimate of the potential death toll from even a nonnuclear war with North Korea is just as striking. North Korea has at least 11,000 artillery pieces trained on Seoul, South Korea’s capital of 25 million people, and would be certain to use them during any conflict. The US would be just as certain to mount a sustained bombing campaign to destroy those artillery pieces as quickly as possible.  The result? “It’s hard for me to see less than 500,000 to 1 million people, and I think that’s a conservative estimate,” he said.  Remember: That’s assuming North Korea doesn’t use its arsenal of nuclear weapons, which can already hit Seoul and much of Japan.  Speaking at the same event, Michèle Flournoy, formerly the No. 3 official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, said Trump’s harsh rhetoric toward Pyongyang — which has included deriding North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Little Rocket Man” — created the real risk of an accidental war between the two countries.  “My worry is that all of this heated rhetoric has really charged the environment so that it’s much more likely now that one side or the other will misread what was intended as a show of commitment or a show of force,” she said. “It could be the basis of a miscalculation that actually starts a war that wasn’t intended at that moment.”  Flournoy currently runs a centrist think tank called the Center for a New American Security (full disclosure: I wrote a book while working as a writer in residence there from 2012 to 2013), and Stavridis is the dean of the Fletcher School of Diplomacy at Tufts University. Neither is gloomy by nature, or prone to alarmism.  And that’s precisely why I left the stage feeling so gloomy, and so alarmed.  Here’s why the odds of war with North Korea are rising  Both Stavridis and Flournoy see Kim as a fundamentally rational leader whose overriding goals are to ensure the survival of his regime and his personal control over North Korea. Nuclear weapons, in Flournoy’s words, are “the ace that he could play if there was a conflict to say, ‘Stop, you’re not going to take me out without risking nuclear war.’”  Stavridis stressed on the panel that the odds were still against an open military conflict with North Korea, let alone nuclear war. But he also made clear that both were definitely possible — and that the odds were rising.  “I think there’s a 10 percent chance the wheels really come off and we have a full-on war on the Korean Peninsula, which would include nuclear use,” he said. “That’s well over double what it was three months ago.”  The retired admiral — who helped oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during his years running NATO — said the chances of a lower-level conflict were even higher, at 20 to 30 percent. He laid out a scenario for how one could break out.  “The Koreans try or actually shoot down a US aircraft. We respond, maybe taking out a bunch of Korean ships in [their] harbor,” he said. “But somehow we manage to contain it and don’t escalate to that full-blown war.”  Flournoy said that preventing that sort of conflict from erupting would require both countries to take tangible steps back from the brink. Trump would need to tone down his rhetoric and send a high-level envoy to China to make clear to Beijing that the North Korean crisis was rapidly approaching a point of no return. Kim would have to agree to some sort of freeze on his testing and development of new nuclear weapons and more advanced long-range missiles.  Stavridis responded as you might have expected, given his cheerful talk of nuclear war with North Korea.  “I think the chances of that are roughly the same of Elvis Presley walking in here right now,” he said.

Expert Estimates 50/50 Chance of Conflict in 2018 By  Sofia Lotto Persio   On 11/9/17 at 11:52 AM       President Donald Trump poses for a photo with military commanders at the U.S. Eighth Army Operation Command Center at U.S. military installation Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, November 7, 2017.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters   Share         World  U.S. North Korea relations  Kim Jong Un  Donald Trump Asia visit A war between the U.S. and North Korea is looking increasingly likely, with a nonproliferation expert estimating a 50/50 chance of conflict breaking out over the next year. Mark Fitzpatrick, the executive director of the global security think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Americas, is the latest expert to closely evaluate the risk of a nuclear war as President Donald Trump continues to seek an international response shunning the North Korean regime in his five-nation Asia tour. “Given the personalities involved on both sides, I do not rate continuation of the status quo as higher than 50 percent,” Fitzpatrick wrote in a post published Wednesday on the IISS website. He noted that he was not the only person to predict an increased likelihood of conflict, as former CIA director John Brennan recently put the chance of war breaking out at 20-25 percent. According to Fitzpatrick, what is particularly concerning are what he calls “wildly optimistic assumptions about how the other side will respond.” He told Newsweek earlier this week he believed the most likely scenario for war to break out was Pyongyang misinterpreting a statement from or move by the U.S. government.

Following Trump’s U.N. General Assembly speech in September, in which he threatened the total destruction of North Korea, the country’s ruler Kim Jong Un issued an unprecedented first-person response in which he warned the president would “pay dearly” for his remarks.

New threats from Trump and Kim highlight troubled history North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho also called Trump’s comments a “declaration of war,” said that Pyongyang reserved the right to shoot down American bombers and hinted that Kim may be considering a hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now In Wednesday’s speech to the South Korean parliament, Trump told Kim to cease provocations and give up its nuclear weapons program, and warned the North Korean leader against underestimating American resolve. “The regime has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation. This is a different administration than the United States has had in the past,” he said. According to Robert Carlin, a U.S.-North Korea relations expert and currently visiting scholar at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation, the recent heated exchanges have further exacerbated the two countries’ mistrust of one another. “After the verbal slugfest between the two leaders in September, there have been only the wispiest of contacts between the sides,” Carlin wrote for the North Korea monitoring website 38 North this week. Carlin’s concern was that North Korea feels overconfident of their nuclear capability and that Trump’s advisors are too keen on dismissing diplomacy with North Korea as failing. The Pentagon’s opinion is that the only way to eliminate Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal with "complete certainty" would be to launch a ground invasion —rather than a "massive air and missile strike," like former director of national intelligence who led U.S. forces in the Pacific, retired Admiral Dennis Blair, proposed last week —but said that this would result in a "catastrophic loss of lives."    North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guides the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on September 16, 2017.  KCNA/via REUTERS  It appears unlikely that North Korea would risk a war with the U.S., but as The New Yorker writer Evan Osnos was told when visiting Pyongyang in September, North Koreans are used to hardship and would withstand a nuclear fallout just as they survived the Korean War and the famine of the mid-nineties. It was the U.S., in their eyes, that had more to lose from a nuclear strike. Both CIA and U.S. military officials have stated that Kim is seeking nuclear weapons to keep himself in power, but an unnamed White House official quoted in The Washington Post  said that the North Korean leader is still to reunify the Korean Peninsula. According to both Fitzpatrick and Carlin's assessment, the atmosphere is ripe for confrontation. “The gods of war are pleased when mortals stumble over their own misperceptions, when they are overwhelmed by myths about themselves and their opponents, when no one is talking anymore, when options narrow, when momentum dictates decisions, when doors slam and are bolted, when sacrifice is glorified and slaughter becomes acceptable,” Carlin wrote.

Washington has adapted to threats in the past, when the risk of action was outweighed by the possible consequences of a military strike. It must do so again.  Reuters  Share         Opinion  North Korea  North Korea missile test  South Korea  Donald Trump    One of the top stories of 2017 is the emergence of North Korea as a nuclear missile power. This was not a great surprise. North Korea has sought a nuclear weapon since at least the 1980s, and its program has been pretty serious since the early 1990s. Nevertheless, it always seemed that considerable hurdles—technical, logistical, financial, intellectual—stood in the way. Now it appears North Korea can launch a missile all the way to North America, and President Donald Trump has elevated the issue to one of his chief priorities. He has used tough language against the North Koreans, at some points appearing to threaten a massive, possibly nuclear, strike. This has created much alarmism and paranoia that war is imminent. But there is little empirical indication that this is so. I live in South Korea, and while there is much rumor, there has been no new stationing here of major U.S. assets. The military aircraft units necessary for an airstrike are not moving in. The armada Trump threatened in the spring still has not arrived. Leaves of U.S. soldiers are not being canceled. Noncombatants are not being evacuated. In short, a glaring gap has opened between the reality in South Korea and Trump’s warlike rhetoric. At some point, the Western media will catch on and begin to report despite the Trumpian bombast, war is unlikely. Indeed, the president recently passed up his best chance to lay the public opinion groundwork for a strike in a speech to the parliament of South Korea. South Korean cooperation, if not open support, is vital for any such strike. Many of the necessary military assets are there, and South Koreans would bear the brunt of any Northern retaliation. Yet Trump did not use the opportunity to lobby for war or even a limited airstrike. Instead, he promoted the decades-old U.S. effort to contain, deter, isolate and sanction the North. If Trump isn’t bothering to sell an attack to the South, then the likelihood, no matter what he says on Twitter, is that he will not strike.

For many years, the United States has put up with three other countries whom we deeply distrust—Russia, China and Pakistan—having nuclear weapons. Only once, in Cuba in 1962, did we consider blocking a nuclear expansion with military force. The result was the terrifying Cuban Missile Crisis. And while the U.S. arguably won that standoff, it so unnerved U.S. decision-makers, as well as the rest of the planet, that it never repeated the exercise. When China developed nuclear missiles in the 1960s and ’70s, we did not interfere, even though China was going through the tumult of the Cultural Revolution. Similarly, when Pakistan nuclearized in the 1990s, the U.S. did not intervene, even though Pakistan had, and still has, serious Islamic fundamentalism problems. In each instance, a state in deep ideological opposition to the U.S.—Stalinist, Maoist and Islamic fundamentalist—acquired nuclear weapons and set off an anxious discussion in the U.S. about “fanatics” with the world’s worst weapons. Yet the alternatives were even worse. Airstrikes on China would have set the whole of East Asia ablaze; dropping Special Forces into Pakistan to hijack its weapons—an idea briefly considered—would have been a near-suicide mission; striking the “Islamic bomb” might have sparked a regional Muslim revolt. In all cases, U.S. officials found the risks of action outweighed by the risks of trying to manage the new status quo. In time, Washington adapted.   This is almost certainly what will happen with North Korea. Once again, “fanatics” have acquired the bomb, and nightmare scenarios of a nuclear war abound. Yet there is little indication that the North Koreans seek these weapons for offensive purposes. Striking the U.S. with a nuclear weapon would clearly lead to the North’s rapid destruction. The Northern elite are not suicidal. Instead, it appears that they wish to survive. They have pointed out that if Saddam Hussein or Muammar el-Qaddafi had had nuclear weapons, they would be alive today.

Reuters   There are strike options, but the possible consequences, including a Sino-U.S. war and the regional use of nuclear weapons, are so dire that we have always demurred. The North has taken major provocative actions at least six times since 1968, and we have never struck back. The reasons then are the same as they are today: North Korea could devastate Seoul with conventional artillery in retaliation; North Korea has a defensive treaty with China; the North would immediately respond to any U.S. airstrike with human shields; North Korea has been tunneling in preparation for war for decades, requiring a U.S. air campaign so large it would effectively be a war—there is realistically no surgical strike option; now that North Korea has nuclear weapons, it could respond to U.S. action by using those weapons. In brief, the risks associated with a U.S. strike on North Korea are high and have just gotten higher with the North’s progress on nuclear missiles. Just as we grudgingly learned to live with Soviet, Chinese and Pakistani nuclearization, I predict we will learn the same with North Korea—even if our leaders will not admit it publicly for some time.

MUST WATCH Kim Jong Un delivers New Year's address  02:20 Story highlights Mullen warned Trump's provocative rhetoric on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely indicates he would prefer a more aggressive approach Sen. Lindsey Graham echoed Mullen's warning about the possibility of war with North Korea Washington (CNN) The United States is "closer to a nuclear war with North Korea" than ever, Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday, adding that he does not "see the opportunities to solve this diplomatically at this particular point." In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Mullen warned that President Donald Trump's provocative rhetoric aimed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely indicates he would prefer to take a more aggressive approach to countering the rogue regime's rapidly evolving nuclear weapons program. A dangerous choice looms for Trump on North Korea "I'm just more inclined to see over time that the rhetoric seems to be where the President is," Mullen said, adding that Defense Secretary James Mattis, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and White House chief of staff John Kelly have managed to deter Trump from following through on his threats of unleashing "fire and fury." "My concern is how long that actually lasts," Mullen said, adding that, at some point, Trump may be inclined to ignore advice from his top national security advisers that runs counter to his own instincts. The North Korean leader addressed the threat of war in a New Year's Day speech on Monday. Read More "We are a responsible nuclear nation that loves peace," Kim said. "As long as there's no aggression against us we do not intend to use nuclear powers." "The US cannot wage a war against our country at all," Kim added. "The entire mainland of the US is within the range of our nuclear weapons, and the nuclear button is always on the desk of my office. They should accurately be aware that this is not a threat but a reality." A year of 'extreme danger' Mullen's warning about the possibility of war with North Korea was echoed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who said Sunday that 2018 could be a year of "extreme danger." Sen. Graham: There's a 30% chance Trump will attack North Korea "We've got a chance here to deliver some fatal blows to some really bad actors in 2018. But if we blink, God help us all," Graham said in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation." Earlier this month, Graham predicted that there is a 30% chance Trump orders a first strike on North Korea to prevent the rogue nation from acquiring a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. "I would say there's a three in 10 chance we use the military option," the South Carolina Republican first said in an interview with The Atlantic and later confirmed to CNN . If the North Koreans conduct an additional test of a nuclear bomb — their seventh — "I would say 70 percent," he said. While Graham, an Air Force veteran who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is widely considered a Republican foreign policy hawk, he repeatedly said in the interview with The Atlantic that he hopes military options are never employed and advocated meeting with the North Koreans in pursuit of a peaceful resolution to tensions between the two nations. In his interview Sunday, Graham said his prediction on the chance of a war with North Korea is "based on a lot of time with President Trump." "He made a decision early on to deny the North Korean regime the capability to hit America with a nuclear-tipped missile," including the use of military force, if necessary, Graham said. Asked if he thought that meant a pre-emptive strike in the coming year, Graham said: "2018 is going to be the year to deny North Korea the capability to hit the homeland. Sanctions will never work completely without the threat of credible military force. How do you change a man's behavior who's willing to kill his own family, torture his own people to stay in power?" "The only way he'll change his behavior, if he believes Donald Trump would use military force to destroy his regime," Graham added. "And the Iranians are watching how Trump deals with North Korea." A report released Saturday by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the country will remain committed to nuclear development in 2018. "Do not expect any change in its policy," the report read. "Its entity as an invincible power can neither be undermined nor be stamped out. The DPRK, as a responsible nuclear weapons state, will lead the trend of history to the only road of independence and justice, weathering all tempests on this planet," the report continued, referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

I also should note that my references   to wars in Iran and Iraq referred to the war between those two nations that   lasted throughout most of the 1980's, with America supporting Iraq against what   was seen as Iran's larger threat. Similarly, my reference to war in Afghanistan   referred to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979-89), not the current American   invasion of Afghanistan, post 9/11.  While the imminent danger of an all-out   nuclear war that would destroy civilization has greatly diminished in the post-Soviet   era, there are processes at work that make nuclear war much more dangerous than   might first appear. Nuclear proliferation is creating more and more nuclear   tinder that could set off a global fire, with India, Pakistan, Israel, and North   Korea being the most obvious possible flash points. Secondly, America now tends   to treat Russia as a has-been superpower which need not be consulted before   we take action that might bring us into confrontation. This is very dangerous   behavior toward a nation with thousands of nuclear weapons. During the 1990's   I was very concerned that American military action in the former Yugoslavia   might bring about a situation similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis, where both   Russia and the US found themselves dragged, reluctantly but inexorably, toward   full scale nuclear confrontation. And as I update this in 2008, the danger is   increasing rapidly as explained on part of my current project's website.  So, while this op-ed at first may   seem inapplicable in the post-Cold-War world, it has many elements of long-term   truth that demand our attention. Given that a process of ending war will take   decades, a long-term view is appropriate.  This page can be viewed in Romanian courtesy of azoft .    On the Probability   of Nuclear War  Martin E. Hellman  Hiram Maxim, the inventor of the   machine gun, declared, "Only a general who was a barbarian would send his   men to certain death against the concentrated power of my new gun." But   send them they did. In World War One, the machine gun often mowed down tens   of thousands of men in a single day.  Orville Wright saw a similar vision:   "When my brother and I built and flew the first man-carrying flying machine,   we thought we were introducing into the world an invention that would make further   wars practically impossible." Far from ending war, however, the airplane   increased the ability to maim and kill. In firebombing raids on London, Hamburg   and Tokyo the airplane wrought previously unimaginable levels of destruction.   In a single night, March 9, 1945, 25 percent of Tokyo was destroyed, 80,000   people were killed, and over 1 million left homeless.  History shows the folly in hoping   that each new, more destructive weapon will not be used. And yet we dare to   hope that this time it will be different. We and the Soviets have amassed a   combined arsenal of 50,000 nuclear weapons, equivalent in destructive force   to some 6,000 World War II’s, capable of reaching their targets in a matter   of minutes, and able to destroy every major city in the world. All in the belief   that they will never be used.  But unless we make a radical shift   in our thinking about war, this time will be no different. On our current path,   nuclear war is inevitable.  The inevitability concept can best   be understood by analogy to finance. It does not make sense to talk of an interest   rate as being high or low, for example 50 percent or 1 percent, without comparing   it to specific period of time. An interest rate of 50 percent per year is high.   An interest rate of 50 percent per century is low. And the low interest rate   of 1 percent per year builds up to a much larger interest rate, say 100 percent,   when compounded over a sufficiently long time.   In the same way, it does not make sense to talk about the probability of nuclear   war being high or low -- for example 10 percent versus 1 percent -- without   comparing it to a specific period of time -- for example, 10 percent per decade   or 1 percent per year. Having gotten the units right, we might argue whether the probability of nuclear   war per year was high or low. But it would make no real difference. If the probability   is 10 percent per year, then we expect the holocaust to come in about 10 years.   If it is 1 percent per year, then we expect it in about 100 years.  The lower probability per year changes the time frame until we expect civilization   to be destroyed, but it does not change the inevitability of the ruin. In either   scenario, nuclear war is 100 percent certain to occur.  This pair of examples brings out a critically important point. Our only survival   strategy is to continuously reduce the probability, driving it ever closer to   zero. In contrast, our current policies are like repeatedly playing Russian   roulette with more and more bullets in the chambers.  We have pulled the trigger in this macabre game more often than is imagined.   Each action on our current path has some chance of triggering the final global   war. And if we keep pulling the trigger, the gun will inevitably go off. Each   "small" war -- in Iran, or Iraq, or Vietnam, or Afghanistan -- is   pulling the trigger; each threat of the use of violence -- as in the Cuban missile   crisis -- is pulling the trigger; each day that goes by in which a missile or   computer can fail is pulling the trigger.  The only way to survive Russian roulette is to stop playing. The only way to   survive nuclear roulette is to move beyond war in the same sense that the civilized   world has moved beyond human sacrifice and slavery.  When it was merely moral and desirable, it might have been impossible to beat   swords into plowshares. Today, it is necessary for survival.  Gen. Douglas MacArthur said in his 1961 address to the Philippines Congress:   "You will say at once that, although the abolition of war has been the   dream of man for centuries, every proposition to that end has been promptly   discarded as impossible and fantastic. But that was before the science of the   past decade made mass destruction a reality. The argument then was along spiritual   and moral lines, and lost. But now the tremendous evolution of nuclear and other   potentials of destruction has suddenly taken the problem away from its primary   consideration as a moral and spiritual question and brought it abreast of scientific   realism."  There is potential for this to be the best of times or the end of time, depending   on which direction we take at this critical juncture in human evolution. Technology   has given a new, global meaning to the Biblical injunction: "I have set   before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you   and your descendants may live."  To avoid extinction, we must take action to shift from an old mode of thinking   which justifies war as necessary for survival to a new mode of thinking which   recognizes war as the ultimate threat to survival.

Since the consequences of nuclear war could be as high as human extinction, the probability of such an outcome would preferably be zero, but this is clearly not the case.  Nuclear weapons have been used twice in the past 72 years, at a time when only one country possessed these weapons.  Today, nine countries possess nuclear weapons, and there are nearly 15,000 of them in the world.  Nuclear deterrence, based upon the threat of nuclear retaliation, is the justification for possession of these weapons. It is, however, a poor justification, being unethical, illegal, and subject to catastrophic failure.  Over the 72 years of the nuclear era, nuclear deterrence has come close to failing on many occasions, demonstrating weaknesses in the hypothesis that threat of retaliation will protect indefinitely against nuclear war.  I asked several individuals working for nuclear disarmament, all Associates of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, about their views on the probability of nuclear war.  Martin Hellman, a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford, had this to say: “Even if nuclear deterrence could be expected to work for 500 years before it failed and destroyed civilization – a time period that sounds highly optimistic to most people – that would be like playing Russian roulette with the life of a child born today. That’s because that child’s expected lifetime is roughly one-sixth of 500 years. And, if that ‘nuclear time horizon’ is more like 100 years, that child would have worse than even odds of living out his or her natural life. Not knowing the level of risk is a gaping hole in our national security strategy. So why does society behave as if nuclear deterrence were essentially risk free?”  I next asked John Avery, an associate professor of quantum chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, for his view of the probability of nuclear war by end of the 21 st century.  He responded:  “There are 83 remaining years in this century. One can calculate the probability that we will reach the end of the century without a nuclear war under various assumptions of yearly risk. Here is a table:  Yearly risk           Chance of survival 1%                             43.4% 2%                             18.7% 3%                              7.9% 4%                              3.4% 5%                              1.4%  “One has to conclude that in the long run, the survival of human civilization and much of the biosphere requires the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.”  Finally, I asked Steven Starr, a scientist at the University of Missouri, who responded in this way:  “I’m not sure if I can provide any sort of numerical value or calculation to estimate the risk of nuclear war in a given time period. However, I certainly would say that unless humans manage to eliminate nuclear arsenals, and probably the institution of war itself, then I think it is very likely that nuclear weapons will be used well before the end of the century.  “But I certainly would say that unless humans manage to eliminate nuclear arsenals, and probably the institution of war itself, then I think it is inevitable that nuclear weapons will be used well before the end of the century.  There are just too many weapons in too many places/countries . . . something close to 15,000 nuclear weapons, right? . . .  and there are too many conflicts and injustices and power-hungry people who have access to and control over these weapons. There are just too many possibilities for miscalculation, failures of technology, and simply irrational behavior, to imagine that we can continue to indefinitely avoid the use of nuclear weapons in conflict.  “Thus I am very happy to see that a treaty to ban nuclear weapons is now being negotiated at the UN. This proves to me that there are a great many people and nations that are fully aware of the nuclear danger and are taking action to stop it.”  Conclusions  The odds of averting a nuclear catastrophe are not comforting.  We are playing Nuclear Roulette with the futures of our children and grandchildren.  The only way to assure that the probability of nuclear war goes to zero is to eliminate all nuclear weapons.  One way to support the goal of nuclear zero is to support the Nuclear Ban Treaty currently being negotiated at the United Nations.  Vaya aquí para la versión española.

McMaster told the Reagan National Defense Forum in California when asked if North Korea’s launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile Tuesday had increased the odds of conflict erupting on the Korean Peninsula.    “There are ways to address this problem short of armed conflict, but it is a race because he’s getting closer and closer, and there’s not much time left,” McMaster said in reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. With each missile launch or nuclear test, Kim has seen his country’s capabilities progress, McMaster added. North Korea, he said, represents “the greatest immediate threat to the United States.” The nuclear-armed North test-fired a long-range missile Wednesday that it said was capable of carrying a “super-large heavy warhead.” After the launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM, Kim declared that his country had “finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.” Experts believe the missile, which likely was tipped with a dummy warhead, could have traveled up to 13,000 km (8,100 miles) — a distance that would put the whole of the continental United States within striking distance — if fired on a standard trajectory. U.S. media, quoting senior U.S. officials, said Saturday that the missile likely broke up upon re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. Technical analysis of the missile flight was ongoing, but the U.S. official said “the North Koreans had problems with re-entry,” CNN reported. Taken together with the need to master missile guidance and targeting, the re-entry failure underscores the challenges facing the country’s weapons program, according to the official. McMaster said that U.S. President Donald Trump remains committed to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, while calling on Beijing to impose tighter economic sanctions on Pyongyang, noting what he called China’s “tremendous coercive economic power” over the North. “We’re asking China not to do us or anybody else a favor,” he said. “We’re asking China to act in China’s interest, as they should, and we believe increasingly that it’s in China’s urgent interest to do more.” China should take unilateral action to cut off North Korean oil imports, McMaster said, adding, “you can’t shoot a missile without fuel.” He said that both he and Trump felt that a 100% oil embargo would “be appropriate at this point.” Meanwhile, the U.S. and South Korean Air Forces were on Monday set to kick off the five-day annual Vigilant Ace exercise involving 12,000 U.S. personnel and more than 230 aircraft from both countries, including U.S. stealth fighter jets from Japan, B-1B strategic bombers from Guam and advanced South Korean aircraft. Six U.S. F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets each arrived in South Korea over the weekend for the exercise, the Yonhap news agency reported Sunday, citing a South Korean Defense Ministry source. Some U.S. Marine F-35Bs, stationed in Japan were also expected to take part in Vigilant Ace, it said. The two countries will stage simulated precision airstrikes on mock North Korean nuclear and missile targets, including transporter erector launchers similar to the ones Pyongyang employs to keep its missiles mobile, the South Korean Air Force said. Normally a rare occurrence, the dispatch to the Korean Peninsula of such advanced U.S. weaponry — known as “strategic assets” — has ramped up amid Pyongyang’s ongoing missile and nuclear tests. North Korea has long denounced the joint military drills as a rehearsal for invasion, though Seoul and Washington have maintained that the exercises are defensive in nature. Late Saturday, the North said Trump was “begging for nuclear war” and labeled Washington a “nuclear demon” for staging the Vigilant Ace exercise. Late Saturday, a spokesman from the North’s Foreign Ministry blasted the “unprecedented” exercise for “simulating actual combat” scenarios, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. “The U.S. is publicly touting the objective of the drill as enhancing the actual combat capability to disable the DPRK’s major strategic bases in the early stages of war,” the unidentified spokesman said. “The Trump team is begging for nuclear war by staging an extremely dangerous nuclear gamble on the Korean peninsula,” the spokesman added. The White House has repeatedly said that all options for reining in the North’s nuclear and missile programs remain on the table, including military action. McMaster, however, acknowledged at Saturday’s defense forum that, given North Korea’s arsenal of conventional artillery and rockets aimed at Seoul, “there’s no military course of action that comes without risk.” Still, he said, Pyongyang’s actions had made America’s alliances with Japan and South Korea “stronger than ever.” Trump has variously threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” and to “totally destroy” the country of 25 million people if the United States is forced to defend itself or its allies. The president’s incendiary language has stoked concern among some security experts and former officials that it, coupled with the  joint military exercises, could lead to the U.S. stumbling into conflict. “These are precisely the types of moves that, in normal times, could be used to bolster deterrence & reassurance,” Colin Kahl, a former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden wrote Friday on Twitter. “But in the context of repeated threats of preventive war by Trump & McMaster could trigger miscalculation.” LATEST ASIA PACIFIC STORIES Vietnam activists question Facebook on suppressing dissent Vietnamese human rights activists and independent media groups have written to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook Inc.'s chief executive, questioning whether the social media platform was helping suppres...

Terrorism, global warning, disease, poverty and nuclear war are all threats that hang over our heads on a daily basis. But is the risk of a disaster like a nuclear apocalypse actually a realistic possibility in this day and age? Let’s take a look at the odds of the end.  Image Credit: wonderfulengineering.com  War of Words  No doubt you will be aware that there has been an ongoing and escalating war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un. The US has taken exception to North Korea’s accelerated nuclear research that led to the country testing weapons of mass destruction and firing missiles over the air space of neighbouring Japan.  It’s a scary time to be a citizen.  When individuals in such powerful positions use such aggressive rhetoric it can push brinkmanship to the next horrific level.  Are Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un the only big risk for causing nuclear war though?  Is Nuclear Armageddon Imminent?  Image Credit: pri.org  Right now, the most obvious candidates to start a nuclear war are the US and North Korea leaders.  That said, the reality of a nuclear war coming from this prolonged dispute between the US and North Korea is fairly low. Former Navy Admiral James Stavridis stated that there is roughly a 10% chance of nuclear war being triggered between the US and North Korea. So, that’s reassuring…kind of.  Despite all the threats and strong language, a nuclear attack would ultimately benefit neither country.  If the US launched a pre-emptive nuclear strike against North Korea then it would technically sacrifice the lives of millions in surrounding nations such as South Korea and Japan, through a retaliatory response by North Korea.  If North Korea launched the pre-emptive nuclear strike then it would effectively signal the end of the North Korean regime with an international response likely to be backed.  Irish bookmaker Paddy Power slashed the odds on the world ending before 2018 from 500/1 to 100/1 when the war of words between Trump and Kim Jong-Un started. However, the bookmaker is still offering odds on Kim Jong-Un remaining as North Korean Supreme Leader beyond 2031 at 4/7.  Who Else Could Trigger Nuclear War?   The US and North Korea are not the only nations that could potentially trigger a nuclear war. Eight sovereign states have developed nuclear weapons. Five of those sovereign states have entered into the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . The US, UK, France, Russia, and China signed up for the treaty.  North Korea, Pakistan, and India are not included in the treaty. It is speculated that Israel also has access to nuclear weapons through its alliance with the US but that has never been confirmed.  Image Credit: sites.google.com  Worryingly, a number of these nations are currently involved in conflicts or tense diplomatic relations with other nations. There has not been an obvious sign that the nations have threatened to use nuclear weapons to resolve the issues but the option is there.  Russia is considered a potential candidate for launching a pre-meditated nuclear strike.  Vladimir Putin has a track record of showing ruthlessness when needed. The Russian conflict with Ukraine led to strained tensions in the Balkans and across the EU too. There is perhaps a 5% to 10% chance of nuclear weapons being used in this conflict. However, it is unlikely to happen unless Russia feels its security is threatened more directly by a greater power.  Pakistan and India is the one conflict that is showing no sign of dying down. Analysts suggest that there is approximately a 10% chance of nuclear war occurring between these two nations.  The dispute over the Kashmir territory has raged on for decades without either nation resorting to nuclear warfare. So, it seems the odds of it happening in the future are low. Still, it only takes the word of one leader to press that red button and the political landscape changes forever.  Image Credit: nationalinterest.org  The Middle East is also a cause for concern. No countries within the region officially possess nuclear weapons at the moment although Iran is seeking to pursue peaceful nuclear research to harness the technology for power.  The US is keen to restrict this due to Iran’s previous rhetoric of threatening to “wipe Israel off the face of the earth”.  There is no doubt that the US would arm Israel with nuclear warheads if the country came under attack. The knock-on effect of such a conflict is remote now but could alter in the future.  Is the End Really Nigh?  Ultimately, nobody benefits from nuclear war. World leaders, hopefully, know this. The term “mutually-assured destruction” has been used often enough to describe why nations in possession of nuclear weapons have not used them since the Second World War.  We do live in a crazy world. It only takes one bomb to get into the wrong hands and the world can change in an instant. Despite what the media tells us, we are actually living in the most secure age in the history of mankind. Humanity has never had it better.  Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Will nuclear war be that end? Not for now but maybe in the future.

Saunders and Michael C. Horowitz   by Elizabeth N. Saunders and Michael C. Horowitz   January 3       This undated photo distributed Sept. 16 by the North Korean government purports to show Kim Jong Un, right, celebrating what was said to be the test launch of an intermediate-range missile. (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)   On Tuesday night, in response to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s claim to have a nuclear button on his desk , President Trump tweeted , “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”  This is not the first time that things have gotten personal in the U.S.-North Korea standoff. Much of the rhetoric between the two leaders and media commentary about the risk of war focuses on the leadership of Trump and Kim — or “Little Rocket Man,” as Trump has called the North Korean leader.  But how much could these two singular leaders really propel us to a nuclear war? Trump’s tweets and other actions certainly can increase the risk of conflict — consistent with our  research on how the decisions of individual leaders affect military conflict.           However, in this case, other factors, including geography and military capabilities, will matter more than tweets or the characteristics of leaders. And these factors reduce the likelihood of war .  Leaders can be important for international conflict  For the past few generations, political scientists who write about the outbreak of conflict mainly argued that leaders were irrelevant , focusing instead on international factors such as great power relations or domestic political factors such as whether the two countries involved had democratic institutions .  But more and more scholarship  suggests that leaders make a large difference in determining whether and how countries go to war. And it’s not just in dictatorships such as that of North Korea; even more constrained leaders, such as U.S. presidents, matter . Leaders’ beliefs and experiences before coming into office can be critical in determining whether a country goes to war and what military strategy will be used in the event of war.  But structural forces are strong in this case  Even if leaders have discretion, they are constrained by material and situational constraints. No U.S. or North Korean leader can realistically change or avoid some of these constraints.  One constraint stems from the two sides’ formidable military capabilities, which mean that a general war with North Korea would be devastating , as Barry Posen argued last year. Even before North Korea acquired a nuclear capability, its artillery put tremendous pressure on South Korea. Add to that its missile arsenal — which, as nuclear experts have chronicled , can now probably deliver an intercontinental ballistic missile armed with a nuclear warhead against the United States .           A second unavoidable constraint is geography, which may make war less likely. North Korean artillery points directly at Seoul, just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone (DMZ). South Korea may oppose a war, which could influence U.S. behavior. North Korea also borders China, a powerful country whose economic support keeps North Korea afloat.  But China faces its own geographic reality with respect to North Korea , and China is increasingly frustrated with North Korea’s behavior. In the event of war, China does not want refugees flooding across the border into China. Yet China also does not want a unified Korean Peninsula with U.S. troops on its border.  Indeed, in the Korean War, the United States tested geographic constraints by pushing beyond the prewar dividing line, the 38th parallel, in an attempt to unify Korea. China intervened to prevent such an outcome, and the conflict stopped where it started.  All sides know that a war would be a huge and difficult military and political problem. So there are strong incentives to try to deter the other side, rather than escalate.  U.S. and North Korean leaders have reason to make war even less likely  Although the focus on Trump and Kim almost always suggests that their behavior increases the risk of war, they actually have strong incentives to reduce the prospect of war.  Despite rhetoric about North Korea’s irrationality, Kim’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles was rational . He wants to stay in power, and nuclear weapons constitute invasion insurance. But a war probably would spell the end of the regime, giving North Korea little reason to start a war.  On the U.S. side, few wars probably have been war-gamed more than a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. U.S. decision-makers know how costly a war might be . Knowledge of these costs makes war less likely.  A leader-driven war would have to overcome strong structural pressures  If “leaders matter” for military decision-making, then with different leaders, we might get a different outcome. So what about Trump and Kim might lead to conflict?  One factor from Trump’s side could be risk acceptance . Trump could decide that he wants to start a war despite the costs, and count on U.S. missile defenses to shoot down North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launches and protect the homeland (an awfully big gamble ). In theory, Trump’s lack of experience also could make him less cognizant of the costs of war and less able to draw on his more experienced advisers .  From Kim’s side, studies suggest that dictators — who face fewer checks and balances — are more risk-acceptant . With fewer people to tell them no, they are more likely to escalate in general.  If war occurs, one pathway is through a misreading of one side’s incentives by the other. For example, Kim’s desire to stay in power could lead Trump to believe that, even in the face of limited U.S. strikes against North Korean nuclear and missile facilities, Kim will back down instead of escalate. But it would be hard to credibly signal that those strikes would be limited, and if Kim believes the United States is coming after him, escalation becomes more likely.  Of course, war could also come via miscalculation and, eventually, some kind of preemptive strike. But research suggests that war spirals of that sort are extremely rare .  In war, as in elections, the fundamentals matter  Many questions in political science and history boil down to this: Do individuals or structural forces shape events?  Although recent evidence in international relations scholarship points to the importance of leaders, the North Korean standoff reminds us of the power of structural factors. That may provide some comfort to those who read the president’s tweet on Tuesday night and worried about the risk of war.  Michael C.

On 25 January, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the hands of the symbolic Doomsday Clock forward to two minutes to midnight. The Doomsday Clock was devised at the end of World War II and midnight on the clock represents a nuclear disaster or apocalyptic event. The closer the Doomsday Clock moves to midnight, the more real the threat is. READ NEXT: What is Doomsday Clock? Donald Trump’s proximity to the USA’s arsenal of some 6,800 nuclear warheads moved the clock to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight in 2017. Now, with the stand-off between the US and North Korea escalating, the threat feels even more real and, alongside the ever-present danger of climate change, worsened by irrational decisions made by President Trump, the organisation advanced the clock forward a further thirty seconds for 2018. This a long way from 1991, where the end of the Cold War meant we were a figurative 17 minutes away. READ NEXT: What is a hydrogen bomb? Most recently, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took to state TV/Twitter to boast about the size of their respective nuclear buttons. Kim Jong-un boasted his button was on his desk and he had completed his nuclear arsenal, which led Trump to retaliate with claims his button is "bigger and more powerful." North Korea fired a missile over Japan last year, causing emergency alarms to ring out across the country. The missile landed in the sea off Hokkaido and South Korea's military is said to have fired back in response. The US condemned the test and the UN Security Council met to discuss the ongoing threat. READ NEXT: How Donald Trump’s views on nukes have gone backwards over time At the end of August, state media in North Korea claimed Kim Jong-un successfully tested a nuclear weapon that could be attached to a long-range missile. The weapon is also claimed to have been a hydrogen bomb more powerful than the atomic weapons dropped during the Second World War and is said to be small enough to fit onto a missile. READ NEXT: A guide to Kim Jong-un’s nuclear weapons Before this recent escalation, there had been more than 2,055 known nuclear detonations – but only two of those were in an actual conflict: the bombs dropped by the USA on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Time hasn’t stood still, so what would happen if a thin-skinned world leader were to aim one of those nukes at a city today?

For simplicity, AsapSCIENCE has taken a one-megaton nuclear bomb as its weapon of choice. That’s 66 times larger than the bomb that devastated Hiroshima, which may seem far-fetched until you realise that it’s like an underwhelming indoor firework compared to the 50-megaton Tsar bomb that Russia dropped on Mityushikha Bay in 1961, which released the nuclear energy of 3,333 Hiroshima bombs. READ NEXT: In a nuclear apocalypse, hair conditioner could be your downfall So, what damage would this one-megaton bomb do? How long is an incomprehensibly destructive piece of string? In short, it depends on a number of factors, including the time of day, the weather, the type of land where it hits, or if it detonates in the air. But there simply isn’t a happy answer to the question, no matter how favourable the conditions. This so-called " Nuke Map ", created by Alex Wellerstein, gives a more accurate idea. It lets you virtually drop a bomb anywhere in the world and you can select the strength of the bomb in question to see the extent of the damage.  There is also an app called Nukey McNukeface (really), designed for Android, that will reveal if you're in North Korea's nuclear strike zone. Nukey shows you a 100km radius from major US and world capitals, but the designer admits that the app is 100% accurate "and is merely for fun". Data and ranges are said to be based on news reports. Around a third of the energy of an atomic bomb is released through thermal radiation. This travels at around the speed of light, so the first thing you’ll see is a blinding flash of light and heat. For a one-megaton bomb, you’ll likely be temporarily blinded if you were standing 13 miles away on a clear day, or 53 miles away on a clear night. Still, temporary blindness aside, you would escape the more serious health complaints: if you were standing seven miles away, you might need to be treated for mild first-degree burns. Stand within five miles of the blast zone, and you’re looking at more serious third-degree burns.  There’s a good chance that would be fatal, but not as good a chance as if you were closer to the blast zone itself. The centre of the Hiroshima bomb was estimated to be around 300,000˚C. For perspective, cremations are carried out in furnaces that reach 1,200˚C, so there’s literally no chance of surviving that. Your chances improve the further out you get, basically, but even if you get serious burns, you may be killed another way before you can be treated. Within a four-mile radius of a one-megaton bomb, blast waves can produce 180 tonnes of force and winds of around 158 miles per hour. That speed reaches 470mph in a half-mile radius. As a human, you might survive that pressure – but you likely wouldn’t survive any nearby buildings collapsing on you. That’s before we even get on to the radiation poisoning. Radiation of 600 REM has a 90% chance of death. That drops by half when you hit 450 REM, but you’re not out of the woods then, with increased chances of cancer and potential genetic mutations. But let’s say you’re not anywhere near the blast. You’re safe then, right? Well, not quite. Overlooking the fact that it wouldn’t be a nuclear war without retaliation, radioactive fallout can travel for hundreds of miles. Yes, its effects diminish after a couple of weeks, but that’s a couple of weeks when you’re going to want to stay in your fallout shelter. What do you mean you don’t have a fallout shelter?

Mesmerising and harrowing map shows every major nuclear explosion in history Again, that’s just a single-megaton bomb, and nukes are a little like Pringles: not only are they potentially deadly – you can’t have just one. A 2007 study examined what would happen if India and Pakistan engaged in a small-scale nuclear war of their own. Small-scale because, comparatively, both nations have fairly small arsenals of around 250 (remember, Russia and the USA have nearly 14,000 between them). The conclusion of this study? With “just” 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs, 20 million would immediately die, five million tonnes of smoke would hit the stratosphere, and we’d enter nuclear winter. Global temperatures drop and agriculture would struggle causing famine and yet more deaths. A 2012 study projected that a 100-bomb nuclear war would cause two billion people to starve. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule. One Japanese man managed to survive being caught in both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs . He eventually died in 2010, aged 93. All the same, there are plenty of reasons to be alarmed when the American president is quoted as welcoming a nuclear arms race . When it comes to nuclear wars, it’s not the case that the side with the biggest arsenal wins – more that everybody loses.

By  Yochi Dreazen    Sep 28, 2017,  9:00am EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Former NATO military chief: there’s a 10% chance of nuclear war with North Korea      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images     Retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis spent 37 years in the military, including four years as the supreme allied commander of NATO. Hillary Clinton vetted him as a possible running mate. President-elect Donald Trump considered naming him secretary of state. He is a serious man, and about as far from an armchair pundit as it’s possible to be.  And that’s precisely what makes his assessment of the escalating standoff with North Korea so jarring. Stavridis believes there’s at least a 10 percent chance of a nuclear war between the US and North Korea, and a 20 to 30 percent chance of a conventional, but still bloody, conflict.  “I think we are closer to a significant exchange of ordnance than we have been since the end of the Cold War on the Korean peninsula,” he said during a panel I moderated Tuesday at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perry World House .  His estimate of the potential death toll from even a nonnuclear war with North Korea is just as striking. North Korea has at least 11,000 artillery pieces trained on Seoul, South Korea’s capital of 25 million people, and would be certain to use them during any conflict. The US would be just as certain to mount a sustained bombing campaign to destroy those artillery pieces as quickly as possible.  The result? “It’s hard for me to see less than 500,000 to 1 million people, and I think that’s a conservative estimate,” he said.  Remember: That’s assuming North Korea doesn’t use its arsenal of nuclear weapons, which can already hit Seoul and much of Japan.  Speaking at the same event, Michèle Flournoy, formerly the No. 3 official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, said Trump’s harsh rhetoric toward Pyongyang — which has included deriding North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Little Rocket Man” — created the real risk of an accidental war between the two countries.  “My worry is that all of this heated rhetoric has really charged the environment so that it’s much more likely now that one side or the other will misread what was intended as a show of commitment or a show of force,” she said. “It could be the basis of a miscalculation that actually starts a war that wasn’t intended at that moment.”  Flournoy currently runs a centrist think tank called the Center for a New American Security (full disclosure: I wrote a book while working as a writer in residence there from 2012 to 2013), and Stavridis is the dean of the Fletcher School of Diplomacy at Tufts University. Neither is gloomy by nature, or prone to alarmism.  And that’s precisely why I left the stage feeling so gloomy, and so alarmed.  Here’s why the odds of war with North Korea are rising  Both Stavridis and Flournoy see Kim as a fundamentally rational leader whose overriding goals are to ensure the survival of his regime and his personal control over North Korea. Nuclear weapons, in Flournoy’s words, are “the ace that he could play if there was a conflict to say, ‘Stop, you’re not going to take me out without risking nuclear war.’”  Stavridis stressed on the panel that the odds were still against an open military conflict with North Korea, let alone nuclear war. But he also made clear that both were definitely possible — and that the odds were rising.  “I think there’s a 10 percent chance the wheels really come off and we have a full-on war on the Korean Peninsula, which would include nuclear use,” he said. “That’s well over double what it was three months ago.”  The retired admiral — who helped oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during his years running NATO — said the chances of a lower-level conflict were even higher, at 20 to 30 percent. He laid out a scenario for how one could break out.  “The Koreans try or actually shoot down a US aircraft. We respond, maybe taking out a bunch of Korean ships in [their] harbor,” he said. “But somehow we manage to contain it and don’t escalate to that full-blown war.”  Flournoy said that preventing that sort of conflict from erupting would require both countries to take tangible steps back from the brink. Trump would need to tone down his rhetoric and send a high-level envoy to China to make clear to Beijing that the North Korean crisis was rapidly approaching a point of no return. Kim would have to agree to some sort of freeze on his testing and development of new nuclear weapons and more advanced long-range missiles.  Stavridis responded as you might have expected, given his cheerful talk of nuclear war with North Korea.  “I think the chances of that are roughly the same of Elvis Presley walking in here right now,” he said.

Expert Estimates 50/50 Chance of Conflict in 2018 By  Sofia Lotto Persio   On 11/9/17 at 11:52 AM       President Donald Trump poses for a photo with military commanders at the U.S. Eighth Army Operation Command Center at U.S. military installation Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, November 7, 2017. Also pictured is U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  Jonathan Ernst/Reuters   Share         World  U.S. North Korea relations  Kim Jong Un  Donald Trump Asia visit A war between the U.S. and North Korea is looking increasingly likely, with a nonproliferation expert estimating a 50/50 chance of conflict breaking out over the next year. Mark Fitzpatrick, the executive director of the global security think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Americas, is the latest expert to closely evaluate the risk of a nuclear war as President Donald Trump continues to seek an international response shunning the North Korean regime in his five-nation Asia tour. “Given the personalities involved on both sides, I do not rate continuation of the status quo as higher than 50 percent,” Fitzpatrick wrote in a post published Wednesday on the IISS website. He noted that he was not the only person to predict an increased likelihood of conflict, as former CIA director John Brennan recently put the chance of war breaking out at 20-25 percent. According to Fitzpatrick, what is particularly concerning are what he calls “wildly optimistic assumptions about how the other side will respond.” He told Newsweek earlier this week he believed the most likely scenario for war to break out was Pyongyang misinterpreting a statement from or move by the U.S. government.

Following Trump’s U.N. General Assembly speech in September, in which he threatened the total destruction of North Korea, the country’s ruler Kim Jong Un issued an unprecedented first-person response in which he warned the president would “pay dearly” for his remarks.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now In Wednesday’s speech to the South Korean parliament, Trump told Kim to cease provocations and give up its nuclear weapons program, and warned the North Korean leader against underestimating American resolve. “The regime has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation. This is a different administration than the United States has had in the past,” he said. According to Robert Carlin, a U.S.-North Korea relations expert and currently visiting scholar at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation, the recent heated exchanges have further exacerbated the two countries’ mistrust of one another. “After the verbal slugfest between the two leaders in September, there have been only the wispiest of contacts between the sides,” Carlin wrote for the North Korea monitoring website 38 North this week. Carlin’s concern was that North Korea feels overconfident of their nuclear capability and that Trump’s advisors are too keen on dismissing diplomacy with North Korea as failing. The Pentagon’s opinion is that the only way to eliminate Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal with "complete certainty" would be to launch a ground invasion —rather than a "massive air and missile strike," like former director of national intelligence who led U.S. forces in the Pacific, retired Admiral Dennis Blair, proposed last week —but said that this would result in a "catastrophic loss of lives."    North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guides the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on September 16, 2017.  KCNA/via REUTERS  It appears unlikely that North Korea would risk a war with the U.S., but as The New Yorker writer Evan Osnos was told when visiting Pyongyang in September, North Koreans are used to hardship and would withstand a nuclear fallout just as they survived the Korean War and the famine of the mid-nineties. It was the U.S., in their eyes, that had more to lose from a nuclear strike. Both CIA and U.S. military officials have stated that Kim is seeking nuclear weapons to keep himself in power, but an unnamed White House official quoted in The Washington Post  said that the North Korean leader is still to reunify the Korean Peninsula. According to both Fitzpatrick and Carlin's assessment, the atmosphere is ripe for confrontation. “The gods of war are pleased when mortals stumble over their own misperceptions, when they are overwhelmed by myths about themselves and their opponents, when no one is talking anymore, when options narrow, when momentum dictates decisions, when doors slam and are bolted, when sacrifice is glorified and slaughter becomes acceptable,” Carlin wrote.

Washington has adapted to threats in the past, when the risk of action was outweighed by the possible consequences of a military strike. It must do so again.  Reuters  Share         Opinion  North Korea  North Korea missile test  South Korea  Donald Trump    One of the top stories of 2017 is the emergence of North Korea as a nuclear missile power. This was not a great surprise. North Korea has sought a nuclear weapon since at least the 1980s, and its program has been pretty serious since the early 1990s. Nevertheless, it always seemed that considerable hurdles—technical, logistical, financial, intellectual—stood in the way. Now it appears North Korea can launch a missile all the way to North America, and President Donald Trump has elevated the issue to one of his chief priorities. He has used tough language against the North Koreans, at some points appearing to threaten a massive, possibly nuclear, strike. This has created much alarmism and paranoia that war is imminent. But there is little empirical indication that this is so. I live in South Korea, and while there is much rumor, there has been no new stationing here of major U.S. assets. The military aircraft units necessary for an airstrike are not moving in. The armada Trump threatened in the spring still has not arrived. Leaves of U.S. soldiers are not being canceled. Noncombatants are not being evacuated. In short, a glaring gap has opened between the reality in South Korea and Trump’s warlike rhetoric. At some point, the Western media will catch on and begin to report despite the Trumpian bombast, war is unlikely. Indeed, the president recently passed up his best chance to lay the public opinion groundwork for a strike in a speech to the parliament of South Korea. South Korean cooperation, if not open support, is vital for any such strike. Many of the necessary military assets are there, and South Koreans would bear the brunt of any Northern retaliation. Yet Trump did not use the opportunity to lobby for war or even a limited airstrike. Instead, he promoted the decades-old U.S. effort to contain, deter, isolate and sanction the North. If Trump isn’t bothering to sell an attack to the South, then the likelihood, no matter what he says on Twitter, is that he will not strike.

For many years, the United States has put up with three other countries whom we deeply distrust—Russia, China and Pakistan—having nuclear weapons. Only once, in Cuba in 1962, did we consider blocking a nuclear expansion with military force. The result was the terrifying Cuban Missile Crisis. And while the U.S. arguably won that standoff, it so unnerved U.S. decision-makers, as well as the rest of the planet, that it never repeated the exercise. When China developed nuclear missiles in the 1960s and ’70s, we did not interfere, even though China was going through the tumult of the Cultural Revolution. Similarly, when Pakistan nuclearized in the 1990s, the U.S. did not intervene, even though Pakistan had, and still has, serious Islamic fundamentalism problems. In each instance, a state in deep ideological opposition to the U.S.—Stalinist, Maoist and Islamic fundamentalist—acquired nuclear weapons and set off an anxious discussion in the U.S. about “fanatics” with the world’s worst weapons. Yet the alternatives were even worse. Airstrikes on China would have set the whole of East Asia ablaze; dropping Special Forces into Pakistan to hijack its weapons—an idea briefly considered—would have been a near-suicide mission; striking the “Islamic bomb” might have sparked a regional Muslim revolt. In all cases, U.S. officials found the risks of action outweighed by the risks of trying to manage the new status quo. In time, Washington adapted.   This is almost certainly what will happen with North Korea. Once again, “fanatics” have acquired the bomb, and nightmare scenarios of a nuclear war abound. Yet there is little indication that the North Koreans seek these weapons for offensive purposes. Striking the U.S. with a nuclear weapon would clearly lead to the North’s rapid destruction. The Northern elite are not suicidal. Instead, it appears that they wish to survive. They have pointed out that if Saddam Hussein or Muammar el-Qaddafi had had nuclear weapons, they would be alive today.

Reuters   There are strike options, but the possible consequences, including a Sino-U.S. war and the regional use of nuclear weapons, are so dire that we have always demurred. The North has taken major provocative actions at least six times since 1968, and we have never struck back. The reasons then are the same as they are today: North Korea could devastate Seoul with conventional artillery in retaliation; North Korea has a defensive treaty with China; the North would immediately respond to any U.S. airstrike with human shields; North Korea has been tunneling in preparation for war for decades, requiring a U.S. air campaign so large it would effectively be a war—there is realistically no surgical strike option; now that North Korea has nuclear weapons, it could respond to U.S. action by using those weapons. In brief, the risks associated with a U.S. strike on North Korea are high and have just gotten higher with the North’s progress on nuclear missiles. Just as we grudgingly learned to live with Soviet, Chinese and Pakistani nuclearization, I predict we will learn the same with North Korea—even if our leaders will not admit it publicly for some time.

MUST WATCH Kim Jong Un delivers New Year's address  02:20 Story highlights Mullen warned Trump's provocative rhetoric on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely indicates he would prefer a more aggressive approach Sen. Lindsey Graham echoed Mullen's warning about the possibility of war with North Korea Washington (CNN) The United States is "closer to a nuclear war with North Korea" than ever, Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday, adding that he does not "see the opportunities to solve this diplomatically at this particular point." In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Mullen warned that President Donald Trump's provocative rhetoric aimed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely indicates he would prefer to take a more aggressive approach to countering the rogue regime's rapidly evolving nuclear weapons program. A dangerous choice looms for Trump on North Korea "I'm just more inclined to see over time that the rhetoric seems to be where the President is," Mullen said, adding that Defense Secretary James Mattis, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and White House chief of staff John Kelly have managed to deter Trump from following through on his threats of unleashing "fire and fury." "My concern is how long that actually lasts," Mullen said, adding that, at some point, Trump may be inclined to ignore advice from his top national security advisers that runs counter to his own instincts. The North Korean leader addressed the threat of war in a New Year's Day speech on Monday. Read More "We are a responsible nuclear nation that loves peace," Kim said. "As long as there's no aggression against us we do not intend to use nuclear powers." "The US cannot wage a war against our country at all," Kim added. "The entire mainland of the US is within the range of our nuclear weapons, and the nuclear button is always on the desk of my office. They should accurately be aware that this is not a threat but a reality." A year of 'extreme danger' Mullen's warning about the possibility of war with North Korea was echoed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who said Sunday that 2018 could be a year of "extreme danger." Sen. Graham: There's a 30% chance Trump will attack North Korea "We've got a chance here to deliver some fatal blows to some really bad actors in 2018. But if we blink, God help us all," Graham said in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation." Earlier this month, Graham predicted that there is a 30% chance Trump orders a first strike on North Korea to prevent the rogue nation from acquiring a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. "I would say there's a three in 10 chance we use the military option," the South Carolina Republican first said in an interview with The Atlantic and later confirmed to CNN . If the North Koreans conduct an additional test of a nuclear bomb — their seventh — "I would say 70 percent," he said. While Graham, an Air Force veteran who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is widely considered a Republican foreign policy hawk, he repeatedly said in the interview with The Atlantic that he hopes military options are never employed and advocated meeting with the North Koreans in pursuit of a peaceful resolution to tensions between the two nations. In his interview Sunday, Graham said his prediction on the chance of a war with North Korea is "based on a lot of time with President Trump." "He made a decision early on to deny the North Korean regime the capability to hit America with a nuclear-tipped missile," including the use of military force, if necessary, Graham said. Asked if he thought that meant a pre-emptive strike in the coming year, Graham said: "2018 is going to be the year to deny North Korea the capability to hit the homeland. Sanctions will never work completely without the threat of credible military force. How do you change a man's behavior who's willing to kill his own family, torture his own people to stay in power?" "The only way he'll change his behavior, if he believes Donald Trump would use military force to destroy his regime," Graham added. "And the Iranians are watching how Trump deals with North Korea." A report released Saturday by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the country will remain committed to nuclear development in 2018. "Do not expect any change in its policy," the report read. "Its entity as an invincible power can neither be undermined nor be stamped out. The DPRK, as a responsible nuclear weapons state, will lead the trend of history to the only road of independence and justice, weathering all tempests on this planet," the report continued, referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Terms of service | Privacy guidelines | AdChoices   The following op-ed appeared in   slightly edited form in The Houston Post , Thursday, April 4, 1985,   under the headline “Arms race can only lead to one end: If we don’t   change our thinking, someone will drop the big one.”  It also appeared in The Times (San Mateo, California), Wednesday, March 20, 1985, under the headline “Nuclear   war 100 percent certain, unless …”  I should emphasize that this article did not call for unilateral disarmament.   As noted in my work on war and   peace , while ending war is necessary for humanity's long term survival,   in the short term we need a strong military to deal with very real threats in   a world that has not accepted that truth.  I also should note that my references   to wars in Iran and Iraq referred to the war between those two nations that   lasted throughout most of the 1980's, with America supporting Iraq against what   was seen as Iran's larger threat. Similarly, my reference to war in Afghanistan   referred to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979-89), not the current American   invasion of Afghanistan, post 9/11.  While the imminent danger of an all-out   nuclear war that would destroy civilization has greatly diminished in the post-Soviet   era, there are processes at work that make nuclear war much more dangerous than   might first appear. Nuclear proliferation is creating more and more nuclear   tinder that could set off a global fire, with India, Pakistan, Israel, and North   Korea being the most obvious possible flash points. Secondly, America now tends   to treat Russia as a has-been superpower which need not be consulted before   we take action that might bring us into confrontation. This is very dangerous   behavior toward a nation with thousands of nuclear weapons. During the 1990's   I was very concerned that American military action in the former Yugoslavia   might bring about a situation similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis, where both   Russia and the US found themselves dragged, reluctantly but inexorably, toward   full scale nuclear confrontation. And as I update this in 2008, the danger is   increasing rapidly as explained on part of my current project's website.  So, while this op-ed at first may   seem inapplicable in the post-Cold-War world, it has many elements of long-term   truth that demand our attention. Given that a process of ending war will take   decades, a long-term view is appropriate.  This page can be viewed in Romanian courtesy of azoft .    On the Probability   of Nuclear War  Martin E. Hellman  Hiram Maxim, the inventor of the   machine gun, declared, "Only a general who was a barbarian would send his   men to certain death against the concentrated power of my new gun." But   send them they did. In World War One, the machine gun often mowed down tens   of thousands of men in a single day.  Orville Wright saw a similar vision:   "When my brother and I built and flew the first man-carrying flying machine,   we thought we were introducing into the world an invention that would make further   wars practically impossible." Far from ending war, however, the airplane   increased the ability to maim and kill. In firebombing raids on London, Hamburg   and Tokyo the airplane wrought previously unimaginable levels of destruction.   In a single night, March 9, 1945, 25 percent of Tokyo was destroyed, 80,000   people were killed, and over 1 million left homeless.  History shows the folly in hoping   that each new, more destructive weapon will not be used. And yet we dare to   hope that this time it will be different. We and the Soviets have amassed a   combined arsenal of 50,000 nuclear weapons, equivalent in destructive force   to some 6,000 World War II’s, capable of reaching their targets in a matter   of minutes, and able to destroy every major city in the world. All in the belief   that they will never be used.  But unless we make a radical shift   in our thinking about war, this time will be no different. On our current path,   nuclear war is inevitable.  The inevitability concept can best   be understood by analogy to finance. It does not make sense to talk of an interest   rate as being high or low, for example 50 percent or 1 percent, without comparing   it to specific period of time. An interest rate of 50 percent per year is high.   An interest rate of 50 percent per century is low. And the low interest rate   of 1 percent per year builds up to a much larger interest rate, say 100 percent,   when compounded over a sufficiently long time.   In the same way, it does not make sense to talk about the probability of nuclear   war being high or low -- for example 10 percent versus 1 percent -- without   comparing it to a specific period of time -- for example, 10 percent per decade   or 1 percent per year. Having gotten the units right, we might argue whether the probability of nuclear   war per year was high or low. But it would make no real difference. If the probability   is 10 percent per year, then we expect the holocaust to come in about 10 years.   If it is 1 percent per year, then we expect it in about 100 years.  The lower probability per year changes the time frame until we expect civilization   to be destroyed, but it does not change the inevitability of the ruin. In either   scenario, nuclear war is 100 percent certain to occur.  This pair of examples brings out a critically important point. Our only survival   strategy is to continuously reduce the probability, driving it ever closer to   zero. In contrast, our current policies are like repeatedly playing Russian   roulette with more and more bullets in the chambers.  We have pulled the trigger in this macabre game more often than is imagined.   Each action on our current path has some chance of triggering the final global   war. And if we keep pulling the trigger, the gun will inevitably go off. Each   "small" war -- in Iran, or Iraq, or Vietnam, or Afghanistan -- is   pulling the trigger; each threat of the use of violence -- as in the Cuban missile   crisis -- is pulling the trigger; each day that goes by in which a missile or   computer can fail is pulling the trigger.  The only way to survive Russian roulette is to stop playing. The only way to   survive nuclear roulette is to move beyond war in the same sense that the civilized   world has moved beyond human sacrifice and slavery.  When it was merely moral and desirable, it might have been impossible to beat   swords into plowshares. Today, it is necessary for survival.  Gen. Douglas MacArthur said in his 1961 address to the Philippines Congress:   "You will say at once that, although the abolition of war has been the   dream of man for centuries, every proposition to that end has been promptly   discarded as impossible and fantastic. But that was before the science of the   past decade made mass destruction a reality. The argument then was along spiritual   and moral lines, and lost. But now the tremendous evolution of nuclear and other   potentials of destruction has suddenly taken the problem away from its primary   consideration as a moral and spiritual question and brought it abreast of scientific   realism."  There is potential for this to be the best of times or the end of time, depending   on which direction we take at this critical juncture in human evolution. Technology   has given a new, global meaning to the Biblical injunction: "I have set   before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you   and your descendants may live."  To avoid extinction, we must take action to shift from an old mode of thinking   which justifies war as necessary for survival to a new mode of thinking which   recognizes war as the ultimate threat to survival.

Since the consequences of nuclear war could be as high as human extinction, the probability of such an outcome would preferably be zero, but this is clearly not the case.  Nuclear weapons have been used twice in the past 72 years, at a time when only one country possessed these weapons.  Today, nine countries possess nuclear weapons, and there are nearly 15,000 of them in the world.  Nuclear deterrence, based upon the threat of nuclear retaliation, is the justification for possession of these weapons. It is, however, a poor justification, being unethical, illegal, and subject to catastrophic failure.  Over the 72 years of the nuclear era, nuclear deterrence has come close to failing on many occasions, demonstrating weaknesses in the hypothesis that threat of retaliation will protect indefinitely against nuclear war.  I asked several individuals working for nuclear disarmament, all Associates of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, about their views on the probability of nuclear war.  Martin Hellman, a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford, had this to say: “Even if nuclear deterrence could be expected to work for 500 years before it failed and destroyed civilization – a time period that sounds highly optimistic to most people – that would be like playing Russian roulette with the life of a child born today. That’s because that child’s expected lifetime is roughly one-sixth of 500 years. And, if that ‘nuclear time horizon’ is more like 100 years, that child would have worse than even odds of living out his or her natural life. Not knowing the level of risk is a gaping hole in our national security strategy. So why does society behave as if nuclear deterrence were essentially risk free?”  I next asked John Avery, an associate professor of quantum chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, for his view of the probability of nuclear war by end of the 21 st century.  He responded:  “There are 83 remaining years in this century. One can calculate the probability that we will reach the end of the century without a nuclear war under various assumptions of yearly risk. Here is a table:  Yearly risk           Chance of survival 1%                             43.4% 2%                             18.7% 3%                              7.9% 4%                              3.4% 5%                              1.4%  “One has to conclude that in the long run, the survival of human civilization and much of the biosphere requires the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.”  Finally, I asked Steven Starr, a scientist at the University of Missouri, who responded in this way:  “I’m not sure if I can provide any sort of numerical value or calculation to estimate the risk of nuclear war in a given time period. However, I certainly would say that unless humans manage to eliminate nuclear arsenals, and probably the institution of war itself, then I think it is very likely that nuclear weapons will be used well before the end of the century.  “But I certainly would say that unless humans manage to eliminate nuclear arsenals, and probably the institution of war itself, then I think it is inevitable that nuclear weapons will be used well before the end of the century.  There are just too many weapons in too many places/countries . . . something close to 15,000 nuclear weapons, right? . . .  and there are too many conflicts and injustices and power-hungry people who have access to and control over these weapons. There are just too many possibilities for miscalculation, failures of technology, and simply irrational behavior, to imagine that we can continue to indefinitely avoid the use of nuclear weapons in conflict.  “Thus I am very happy to see that a treaty to ban nuclear weapons is now being negotiated at the UN. This proves to me that there are a great many people and nations that are fully aware of the nuclear danger and are taking action to stop it.”  Conclusions  The odds of averting a nuclear catastrophe are not comforting.  We are playing Nuclear Roulette with the futures of our children and grandchildren.  The only way to assure that the probability of nuclear war goes to zero is to eliminate all nuclear weapons.  One way to support the goal of nuclear zero is to support the Nuclear Ban Treaty currently being negotiated at the United Nations.  Vaya aquí para la versión española.

McMaster told the Reagan National Defense Forum in California when asked if North Korea’s launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile Tuesday had increased the odds of conflict erupting on the Korean Peninsula.    “There are ways to address this problem short of armed conflict, but it is a race because he’s getting closer and closer, and there’s not much time left,” McMaster said in reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. With each missile launch or nuclear test, Kim has seen his country’s capabilities progress, McMaster added. North Korea, he said, represents “the greatest immediate threat to the United States.” The nuclear-armed North test-fired a long-range missile Wednesday that it said was capable of carrying a “super-large heavy warhead.” After the launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM, Kim declared that his country had “finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.” Experts believe the missile, which likely was tipped with a dummy warhead, could have traveled up to 13,000 km (8,100 miles) — a distance that would put the whole of the continental United States within striking distance — if fired on a standard trajectory. U.S. media, quoting senior U.S. officials, said Saturday that the missile likely broke up upon re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. Technical analysis of the missile flight was ongoing, but the U.S. official said “the North Koreans had problems with re-entry,” CNN reported. Taken together with the need to master missile guidance and targeting, the re-entry failure underscores the challenges facing the country’s weapons program, according to the official. McMaster said that U.S. President Donald Trump remains committed to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, while calling on Beijing to impose tighter economic sanctions on Pyongyang, noting what he called China’s “tremendous coercive economic power” over the North. “We’re asking China not to do us or anybody else a favor,” he said. “We’re asking China to act in China’s interest, as they should, and we believe increasingly that it’s in China’s urgent interest to do more.” China should take unilateral action to cut off North Korean oil imports, McMaster said, adding, “you can’t shoot a missile without fuel.” He said that both he and Trump felt that a 100% oil embargo would “be appropriate at this point.” Meanwhile, the U.S. and South Korean Air Forces were on Monday set to kick off the five-day annual Vigilant Ace exercise involving 12,000 U.S. personnel and more than 230 aircraft from both countries, including U.S. stealth fighter jets from Japan, B-1B strategic bombers from Guam and advanced South Korean aircraft. Six U.S. F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets each arrived in South Korea over the weekend for the exercise, the Yonhap news agency reported Sunday, citing a South Korean Defense Ministry source. Some U.S. Marine F-35Bs, stationed in Japan were also expected to take part in Vigilant Ace, it said. The two countries will stage simulated precision airstrikes on mock North Korean nuclear and missile targets, including transporter erector launchers similar to the ones Pyongyang employs to keep its missiles mobile, the South Korean Air Force said. Normally a rare occurrence, the dispatch to the Korean Peninsula of such advanced U.S. weaponry — known as “strategic assets” — has ramped up amid Pyongyang’s ongoing missile and nuclear tests. North Korea has long denounced the joint military drills as a rehearsal for invasion, though Seoul and Washington have maintained that the exercises are defensive in nature. Late Saturday, the North said Trump was “begging for nuclear war” and labeled Washington a “nuclear demon” for staging the Vigilant Ace exercise. Late Saturday, a spokesman from the North’s Foreign Ministry blasted the “unprecedented” exercise for “simulating actual combat” scenarios, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. “The U.S. is publicly touting the objective of the drill as enhancing the actual combat capability to disable the DPRK’s major strategic bases in the early stages of war,” the unidentified spokesman said. “The Trump team is begging for nuclear war by staging an extremely dangerous nuclear gamble on the Korean peninsula,” the spokesman added. The White House has repeatedly said that all options for reining in the North’s nuclear and missile programs remain on the table, including military action. McMaster, however, acknowledged at Saturday’s defense forum that, given North Korea’s arsenal of conventional artillery and rockets aimed at Seoul, “there’s no military course of action that comes without risk.” Still, he said, Pyongyang’s actions had made America’s alliances with Japan and South Korea “stronger than ever.” Trump has variously threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” and to “totally destroy” the country of 25 million people if the United States is forced to defend itself or its allies. The president’s incendiary language has stoked concern among some security experts and former officials that it, coupled with the  joint military exercises, could lead to the U.S. stumbling into conflict. “These are precisely the types of moves that, in normal times, could be used to bolster deterrence & reassurance,” Colin Kahl, a former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden wrote Friday on Twitter. “But in the context of repeated threats of preventive war by Trump & McMaster could trigger miscalculation.” LATEST ASIA PACIFIC STORIES Vietnam activists question Facebook on suppressing dissent Vietnamese human rights activists and independent media groups have written to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook Inc.'s chief executive, questioning whether the social media platform was helping suppres...

Terrorism, global warning, disease, poverty and nuclear war are all threats that hang over our heads on a daily basis. But is the risk of a disaster like a nuclear apocalypse actually a realistic possibility in this day and age? Let’s take a look at the odds of the end.  Image Credit: wonderfulengineering.com  War of Words  No doubt you will be aware that there has been an ongoing and escalating war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un. The US has taken exception to North Korea’s accelerated nuclear research that led to the country testing weapons of mass destruction and firing missiles over the air space of neighbouring Japan.  It’s a scary time to be a citizen.  When individuals in such powerful positions use such aggressive rhetoric it can push brinkmanship to the next horrific level.  Are Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un the only big risk for causing nuclear war though?  Is Nuclear Armageddon Imminent?  Image Credit: pri.org  Right now, the most obvious candidates to start a nuclear war are the US and North Korea leaders.  That said, the reality of a nuclear war coming from this prolonged dispute between the US and North Korea is fairly low. Former Navy Admiral James Stavridis stated that there is roughly a 10% chance of nuclear war being triggered between the US and North Korea. So, that’s reassuring…kind of.  Despite all the threats and strong language, a nuclear attack would ultimately benefit neither country.  If the US launched a pre-emptive nuclear strike against North Korea then it would technically sacrifice the lives of millions in surrounding nations such as South Korea and Japan, through a retaliatory response by North Korea.  If North Korea launched the pre-emptive nuclear strike then it would effectively signal the end of the North Korean regime with an international response likely to be backed.  Irish bookmaker Paddy Power slashed the odds on the world ending before 2018 from 500/1 to 100/1 when the war of words between Trump and Kim Jong-Un started. However, the bookmaker is still offering odds on Kim Jong-Un remaining as North Korean Supreme Leader beyond 2031 at 4/7.  Who Else Could Trigger Nuclear War?   The US and North Korea are not the only nations that could potentially trigger a nuclear war. Eight sovereign states have developed nuclear weapons. Five of those sovereign states have entered into the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . The US, UK, France, Russia, and China signed up for the treaty.  North Korea, Pakistan, and India are not included in the treaty. It is speculated that Israel also has access to nuclear weapons through its alliance with the US but that has never been confirmed.  Image Credit: sites.google.com  Worryingly, a number of these nations are currently involved in conflicts or tense diplomatic relations with other nations. There has not been an obvious sign that the nations have threatened to use nuclear weapons to resolve the issues but the option is there.  Russia is considered a potential candidate for launching a pre-meditated nuclear strike.  Vladimir Putin has a track record of showing ruthlessness when needed. The Russian conflict with Ukraine led to strained tensions in the Balkans and across the EU too. There is perhaps a 5% to 10% chance of nuclear weapons being used in this conflict. However, it is unlikely to happen unless Russia feels its security is threatened more directly by a greater power.  Pakistan and India is the one conflict that is showing no sign of dying down. Analysts suggest that there is approximately a 10% chance of nuclear war occurring between these two nations.  The dispute over the Kashmir territory has raged on for decades without either nation resorting to nuclear warfare. So, it seems the odds of it happening in the future are low. Still, it only takes the word of one leader to press that red button and the political landscape changes forever.  Image Credit: nationalinterest.org  The Middle East is also a cause for concern. No countries within the region officially possess nuclear weapons at the moment although Iran is seeking to pursue peaceful nuclear research to harness the technology for power.  The US is keen to restrict this due to Iran’s previous rhetoric of threatening to “wipe Israel off the face of the earth”.  There is no doubt that the US would arm Israel with nuclear warheads if the country came under attack. The knock-on effect of such a conflict is remote now but could alter in the future.  Is the End Really Nigh?  Ultimately, nobody benefits from nuclear war. World leaders, hopefully, know this. The term “mutually-assured destruction” has been used often enough to describe why nations in possession of nuclear weapons have not used them since the Second World War.  We do live in a crazy world. It only takes one bomb to get into the wrong hands and the world can change in an instant. Despite what the media tells us, we are actually living in the most secure age in the history of mankind. Humanity has never had it better.  Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Will nuclear war be that end? Not for now but maybe in the future.
