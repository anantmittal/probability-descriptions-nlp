Genes determine many things about the person. For example, what the person will look like and whether he or she is likely to have certain illnesses. In addition, genes have instructions for making proteins in the cells. Proteins are needed for the body to work correctly.  FXS is caused by a change in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The FMR1 gene makes a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that is needed for normal brain development.  Chromosomes  Genes are found on chromosomes. Every human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. People get their chromosomes from their parents. People get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from their father. The chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They decide if a person is male or female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).  The FMR1 gene is on the X chromosome.  DNA  The chromosomes and genes have a special code called DNA. DNA has four chemical letters, called “bases”: A, C, T, and G. The order of the letters determines the information carried in each gene, like the way that a specific pattern of letters makes up the words in a sentence.  How FXS is Inherited  There is a place in the FMR1 gene where the DNA pattern CGG is repeated over and over again. In most people, the number of repeats is small (5 to 44 repeats), which is normal. If the number of repeats is too large (more than 200 repeats), the gene turns off. When the gene is turned off, no protein is made. Without the protein, the person develops FXS. This is called a “trinucleotide repeat disorder.” People get (inherit) the disorder from their parents.

Normal: 5 to 44 Repeats  Most people have about 5 to 44 repeats of the letters CGG in their FMR1 genes. This is considered a normal number of repeats. People with a normal number of repeats do not have FXS and are not at risk for having children with FXS.  Intermediate: 45 to 54 Repeats  People who have an intermediate number of repeats (about 45 to 54) do not have FXS. However, they may have a slightly higher chance of having some symptoms.  Premutation: 55 to 200 Repeats  People who have a premutation (about 55 to 200 repeats) do not have FXS. However, they might have another fragile X-associated disorder and related concerns . In addition, people with a premutation can have children with a premutation or full mutation (FXS).   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing the premutation or full mutation on to their child (daughters or sons). The more CGG repeats the mother has, the more likely her child will have full mutation fragile X.  Men will have daughters with a premutation, but sons will not be affected.   Full Mutation (FXS): More than 200 Repeats  People with a full mutation (more than 200 repeats) have FXS.   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing fragile X on to their child (sons or daughters).

What is Fragile X syndrome?  The term Fragile X refers to a group of conditions due to defects in a gene on the X chromosome:   Fragile X syndrome (FXS)  Fragile X-associated Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS)  Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI)   Fragile X syndrome (FXS), first known as Martin-Bell syndrome, is the most common inherited form of mental impairment. FXS affects 1 in 4,000 boys and 1 in 6,000 girls of all races and ethnic groups. While Fragile X individuals have a normal life expectancy, most will need support and care for their entire lives. A single gene in the brain cells shuts down, causing Fragile X syndrome. In 1991, scientists discovered the defect in a gene on the X chromosome (called FMR1) that causes FXS. In affected individuals, this gene is shut down and cannot manufacture the protein it normally makes – a protein vital for normal brain development and functioning. Large-scale population studies of Fragile X still need to be done, but it is clear that this is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans. Most people with Fragile X are not yet correctly diagnosed. Research is aimed at developing effective treatments. In addition, this research is leading to better understanding and treatments for other conditions, such as autism, and Alzheimer’s Disease.

There have been a number of studies aimed at determining the prevalence of FXS in males and females. Studies have been undertaken both in the “special needs” population and the general population. The agreed upon prevalence of FXS in males is approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 and in females is approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000.  The reason it is lower in females is that, while all males with an FMR1 full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome, some females with an FMR1 full mutation will not have behavioral, cognitive or physical features of FXS.   How Many Individuals are Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation?  According to a 2012 study by the CDC , the frequency of Fragile X premutation is as follows:  1 in 151 females, or about 1 million women in the United States.  1 in 468 males, or about 320,000 men in the United States.  These statistics are important because both men and women are at risk for having symptoms linked to Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Women with a premutation reported their last menstrual cycle at an earlier age than women without a premutation (48 vs. 51 years).  Men and women with a premutation were more than four times as likely to report dizziness or fainting as people without a premutation (18% vs. 4%). Men and women with a premutation were more than twice as likely to report numbness as people without a premutation (29% vs. 13%).  This study of 6,747 older adults in Wisconsin found 30 people with a change in the FMR1 gene. Based on this relatively small number of people, the results should be interpreted with caution. These findings may not reflect all people in the United States with an FMR1 premutation For example a large Israeli study found approximately 1/130 women were FMR1 carriers.   Prevalence of FXTAS  Current estimates suggest that about 30-40% of male FMR1 premutation carriers over 50 years of age, within families already known to have someone with Fragile X, will ultimately exhibit some features of FXTAS.  This figure may be as low as 10-20% in the general population, since the majority of carriers have a premutation in the lower range of CGG repeats, where the occurrence of FXTAS appears to be reduced.  Though there are specific diagnostic criteria for FXTAS , some men may only exhibit some of the symptoms, and may not develop all of the cardinal features of the condition.  For men who are premutation carriers, the chance of developing core symptoms of FXTAS (tremor, problems with walking/balance) increases with age.  From age 50-59 the chance is about 17%.  From age 60-69 about 38%.  From age 70-79 about 47%.  Over 80 years old, about 75% will develop symptoms of FXTAS.  Studies of females have found that about 8-16% of premutation carriers, within families already known to have someone with a Fragile X condition, develop some FXTAS symptoms. The symptoms in females tend to be milder.  FXTAS may be one of the most common adult onset, single-gene neurological diseases; similar in prevalence to other neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease); however more studies within the general population will be necessary before the true incidence is known.   Prevalence of FXPOI  Approximately 20-25% of women with an FMR1 premutation will develop FXPOI . FXPOI covers a range of ovarian difficulties including early menopause, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, sub fertility and premature ovarian failure (cessation of menstrual periods prior to age 40)   How Common are Intermediate (Grey Area) Alleles?  Approximately 1 in 50 (2%) of individuals have an intermediate allele . There appear to be no clinical associations with intermediate alleles. Most intermediate alleles are stable and do not change over generations. In a small number of families intermediate alleles show some slight instability and can lead to a premutation in future generations. Individuals with an intermediate allele are not at risk for any for the FXDs or to have children with Fragile X syndrome.  Based on the best available evidence:  Approximately 1 million Americans carry the Fragile X mutation, including approximately 100,000 with Fragile X syndrome, and are at risk for developing a Fragile X-associated Disorder.  Approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: The vast majority of males with the full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: Approximately 50% of females with the full mutation will have some features of Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 468 men in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.  Approximately 1 in 151 women in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.       male chromosomes   Female Chromosomes     Genetics and Inheritance        What Are Chromosomes?  Our bodies are made up of about 60 trillion cells. Each one of those cells manufactures proteins. The kinds of proteins any given cell makes determine its particular characteristics, which in turn create the characteristics of the entire body.  The instructions for making these proteins are stored in chemicals or molecules called DNA, which is organized into chromosomes. Chromosomes are found in the center, or nucleus, of all of our cells, including the eggs and sperm.  Chromosomes are passed down from generation to generation through the egg and sperm. Typically, we all have 46 chromosomes in our cells, two of which are sex chromosomes. In females, these are two Xs; in males they are an X and a Y.    The Role of Genes?  Genes are sections of DNA that are passed from generation to generation and perform one function. If we think of DNA as letters in the alphabet, the genes are words and the chromosome is a full sentence. All 46 chromosomes then make up the whole book.  There are many genes on each chromosome; we all have tens of thousands of genes that instruct our bodies on how to develop.  Genes are given names to identify them and the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome is called FMR1. The FMR1 Gene is on the X chromosome.    How Do Changes in the FMR1 Gene Lead to FXS?  The FMR1 gene appears in four forms that are defined by the number of repeats of a pattern of DNA called CGG repeats.  Individuals with less than 45 CGG repeats have a normal FMR1 gene. Those with 45-54 CGG repeats have what is called an “intermediate” or “grey zone allele,” which does not cause any of the known Fragile X associated disorders.  Individuals with 55-200 CGG repeats have a “premutation,” which means they carry an unstable mutation of the gene that can expand in future generations and thus cause Fragile X syndrome in their children or grandchildren. Individuals with a premutation can also develop FXTAS or FXPOI themselves.  Individuals with over 200 CGG repeats have a full mutation of the FMR1 gene, which causes Fragile X syndrome.  The full mutation causes the FMR1 gene to shut down or “methylate” in one region. Normally, the FMR1 gene produces an important protein called FMRP. When the gene is turned off, the individual does not make this protein. The lack of this specific protein is what causes Fragile X syndrome.    The Fragile X Premutation  Fragile X-associated Disorders are a group of conditions called trinucleotide repeat disorders. A common feature of these conditions is that the gene can change sizes over generations, becoming more unstable, and thus the conditions may occur more frequently or severely in subsequent generations. These conditions are often caused by a gene change that begins with a premutation and then expands to a full mutation in subsequent generations.  Approximately 1 in 151 females and 1 in 468 males carry the FMR1 premutation. They are thus “carriers” of the premutation.  Premutations are defined as having 55-200 CGG repeats and can occur in both males and females. When a father passes the premutation on to his daughters, it usually does not expand to a full mutation. A man never passes the Fragile X gene to his sons, since he passes only his Y chromosome to them, which does not contain a Fragile X gene.  A female with the FMR1 premutation will often pass on a larger version of the mutation to her children (more on this point below). She also has a 50 percent chance of passing on her normal X chromosome in each pregnancy, since usually only one of her X chromosomes has the FMR1 mutation.  The chance of the premutation expanding to a full mutation is related to the size of the mother’s premutation. The larger the mother’s CGG repeat number, the higher the chance that it will expand to a full mutation if it is passed on.  Typically, the premutation has no immediate and observable impact on a person’s appearance or health. However, some females with a premutation will experience Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) , which causes infertility, irregular or missed menstrual cycles, and/or early menopause.  Additionally, some older adults with a premutation may develop a neurological condition called FXTAS , (Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder.  FXTAS and FXPOI are part of the family of conditions called Fragile X-associated Disorders.    The FMR1 Full Mutation  A full mutation is defined as having over 200 CGG repeats and causes that indicate the presence of Fragile X syndrome in males and some females. Most full mutation expansions have some degree of Methylation (the process which “turns off” the gene). Males with a full mutation will have Fragile X Syndrome , though with varying degrees of severity  About 65-70 percent of females with a full mutation exhibit some difficulties with cognitive, learning, behavioral, or social functioning, and may also have some of the physical features of FXS (such as large ears or a long face). The remaining 30-35 percent are at risk to develop mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, or they may have no observable effects of the full mutation.    Inheritance  Fragile X in an “X-linked” condition, which means that the gene is on the X chromosome.  Since a woman has two X chromosomes a woman with a premutation or full mutation has a 50% chance of passing on the X with the mutation in each pregnancy, and a 50% chance of passing on her normal X.  If she has a premutation, and it is passed on (to either males or females), it can remain a premutation or it can expand to a full mutation. If she has a full mutation and it is passed on (to either males or females), it will remain a full mutation.  Because males have only one X chromosome, fathers who carry the premutation will pass it on to all their daughters and none of their sons (they pass their Y chromosome on to their sons). There have been no reports of premutations that are passed from a father to his daughter expanding to a full mutation. This appears to only occur when passed from a mother to her children.    Unique Features of Fragile X Inheritance  In many X-linked conditions only males who inherit the abnormal gene are affected. Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked conditions that can also affect females.  Additionally, in other X-linked conditions all males who carry the abnormal form of the gene are affected. In Fragile X syndrome, unaffected males can carry the gene in the premutation form while themselves having no symptoms of the condition.        FMR1 Gene    What Is a Gene?  A gene is a unit of heredity that is passed down from parent to child. Genes are located on chromosomes that are in all of our cells, including the sperm and egg that make a baby.   What Is a Gene Made Of?  Genes are made of molecules or chemicals called DNA. The pattern of DNA will determine if the gene is working properly. The DNA has to be in a certain pattern or order, like the numbers in a phone number.   How Does a Gene Work?  A gene has different parts that work together like a factory or machine. It has a “promoter” that turns the gene on, like a light switch. It has sections that are just “filler” and act as place holders, called “introns.” The sections that are used to make a protein or do a job are called “exons.”   What Do Genes Do?  The job of a gene is to either make a protein, the building blocks of all the structures in the body, or to regulate other proteins in the body.   How Does a Gene Make Proteins?  The DNA in the gene is a code that is “transcribed” or “talks” to another kind of molecule called RNA. This is like one side of Velcro sticking to another that it matches up to. The RNA then “translates” the DNA to put together the protein.     Now that you understand what genes are, let’s discuss the Fragile X gene…   The Fragile X ( FMR1 ) Gene   Why Is It Called the FMR1 Gene?  Genes are named when they are discovered. Often the name isn’t exactly the same as the condition, in case it is later discovered that there is more than one gene involved in the condition. The gene that causes Fragile X is called the “ FMR1 gene,” which stands for Fragile X mental retardation gene. Though the term “mental retardation” has given way in recent years to the more generally accepted term of “intellectual disabilities,” the scientific name of the gene can’t change with the times.    Ideogram of X chromosome    Where Is the FMR1 Gene Located?  The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome. We all have 46 chromosomes in all of our cells, 44 of which are numbered 1-22 in pairs. Then females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Each chromosome has two arms, one called the “p” arm (the short arm) and one called the “q” arm (the long arm).  There are many genes on each chromosome, like houses on a street. Each gene is given an address, depending on where it lies on the chromosome. The address of the FMR1 gene is Xq27.3   Does Everyone Have an FMR1 Gene?  Yes, everyone has an FMR1 gene. When someone states, “I have the gene for Fragile X,” they really mean they have a gene mutation for Fragile X. Some Fragile X genes are normal and some are not.   What Does the FMR1 Gene Do?  The FMR1 gene makes a very important protein called FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein). Though this protein is found in all our cells, it is most abundant in the nerve cells, and particularly in a part of the nerve cell that “talks” to other nerve cells called “dendrites.”    What Is an FMR1 Gene Mutation?  A mutation is any change in a gene. Some mutations don’t cause any problems and we don’t know about them (unless found in the laboratory). Mutations in the FMR1 gene involve an abnormal expansion of the DNA in the “promoter” area of the gene. Often a mutation causes decreased or absent protein production. In individuals with a “ full mutation ,” their FMR1 gene is shut down and they don’t make enough or any FMRP.   Are There Different Kinds of FMR1 Mutations?  Yes. An individual can have a normal FMR1 gene, a “ premutation ” or a “ full mutation .” There is also another category called an “intermediate allele,” which is not a true mutation, but an expansion somewhere between the “normal” FMR1 gene and the premutation.   What Is the Difference Between These Mutations?    FMR1 Gene Categories   The mutation of the FMR1 gene involves a repeating pattern of DNA called a “CGG repeat.” DNA is made of molecules that are abbreviated A, C, G and T. A CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene is a pattern of DNA that may repeats itself anywhere from 30 to 1000 times. In the FMR1 gene there is an area of the promoter that is rich in these CGG repeats and is measured when Fragile X testing is performed.  In this area, there is normally about 30 repeats of CGG. In individuals with the premutation, there are from 55-200 of these repeats. Persons with the full mutation have more than 200 of the CGG repeats. When there is more than 200 CGG repeats, the gene is turned off by a process called Methylation .  Methylation happens to other genes too, when they are supposed to be turned off (as in the genes we don’t use, like those that make a tail grow!). In Fragile X the methylation turns off the FMR1 gene, so no FMRP is produced. This is what causes Fragile X Syndrome .   FMRP – The Fragile X Protein   Each cell works somewhat like a factory. The external membrane functions as the exterior walls of the factory. The nucleus stores the genetic blueprints in the form of DNA. The machinery (ribosomes) for assembling the products (proteins) is attached to the shop floor (endoplasmic reticulum). The Golgi concentrates the proteins to export them. The lysosome is used for waste disposal and recycling.   What Do Proteins Do?    Used with permission of Paul Thiessen Chemical Graphics   The body makes about 50,000 different kinds of protein. These proteins serve in two major roles. Some of them make up part of the structure of our bodies. Others are enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that works like a tool. It helps a particular chemical reaction take place.  For example, there is a particular enzyme that breaks apart starch into sugar molecules; you use it in your small intestine to digest your carbohydrates. Another enzyme takes a sugar molecule and adds a phosphate onto it to make it unstable. Then a series of about 20 more enzymes each process the unstable sugar molecule in a disassembly line that pulls the sugar molecule apart and releases energy.  Proteins are made out of 20 different amino acids like leucine, lysine, tryptophan, etc. When you eat foods that contain proteins, the first thing your digestive system does is to break them down into amino acids. Then you assemble those amino acids into your own proteins. In a way, it is like words. You can make all kinds of words out of 26 letters. You could take a magazine, cut apart all of the letters and reassemble them into your own words. The proteins you make are assembled out of the parts from the proteins you digested from your food.  Fragile X syndrome is caused because people with the disease don’t make a particular protein, FMRP. Sometimes someone asks why we can’t just feed a person with Fragile X more protein. The problem is not lack of protein; a bunch of proteins won’t help someone who is missing FMRP. It is a specific protein that is missing, not proteins in general.  To understand this, think about someone who is trying to say the word “frozen”. Handing the person a list of names from the phone book won’t help. In the same way, having someone eat a bunch of proteins won’t give the person the specific protein that is needed.  Even if we injected that person with lots of FMRP, it would not help. FMRP needs to be present in the right cells at the right time in the right amount.  We are just beginning to learn which cells normally make FMRP. We have some clues about what the function of FMRP is but we have much to learn.    Used with Permission of Dennis Kunkel’s Image Gallery   The synthesis of a protein such as FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein) begins in the nucleus of the cell when the DNA receives a request for that specific information. It is a bit like someone going to a library and selecting a particular book. In response to the request, the DNA opens up and a copy of the coded information is transcribed, much like someone photocopies a chapter of a book in a library. That copy of the DNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA).  The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes out to the main part of the cell, the cytoplasm. There the coded mRNA is translated on ribosomes with the help of transfer RNA and a protein is assembled out of amino acids.  The protein takes on a particular shape that allows it to perform very specific tasks. While we know the tasks of some of the proteins that humans make, we only have hints about the role of FMRP.   Methylation     Used with permission of New England Biolabs   One of the ways the cells control which genetic information they will use is to chemically modify the DNA. The illustration on the left shows an enzyme (diagrammed in ribbons) adding methyl groups to some of the DNA (balls in the form of a double helix). This inactivates that part of the chromosome. It’s as if we were to put glue on the edges of some of the books in the library; those pages would become unavailable to readers.   Good methylation  In females methylation is used regularly to solve a problem. Men have only one X chromosome and women have two. As a result, female cells might be expected to make twice as much protein from the information on X chromosomes as males do. Instead, women’s cells randomly pick one of the X chromosomes and turn it off by methylation. Thus both males and females have one working X chromosome in each cell and as a result, one working unit of all the genetic information on the X chromosome.   Bad methylation  As noted above, methylation is generally a useful method for turning off chromosomal information. However, in Fragile X syndrome, methylation is involved in causing the disease. Near the FMR1 Gene is a regulatory site called a CpG island. In most people, the site is not methylated. As a result, the cell can use the FMR1 gene when there is a need for FMRP – The Fragile X Protein .  In people with Fragile X syndrome, the CpG island is methylated. As a result, the cell is unable to copy the information in the FMR1 gene. Since an mRNA copy is not made, FMRP will not be synthesized. Since there is no FMRP at the time and place it is needed, the characteristics of Fragile X syndrome are set in motion.   It’s not really the CGG’s  Much of the focus on Fragile X syndrome is on the expansion of the repeated CGG’s . It is technically not the expansion that directly causes the problem. Instead, having more than 230 CGG repeats sets in motion methylation of part of the FMR1 gene. The methylation stops the synthesis of FMRP and the absence of FMRP causes Fragile X syndrome. We do not know why having too many CGG repeats triggers methylation.  In theory, if the methylation could be removed from that spot on the FMR1 gene, it could allow access to the FMR1 gene and allow its FMRP product to be assembled. This is one of the potential treatment areas that researchers are investigating.   Mosaic females  The inactivation of female X chromosomes by methylation mentioned above, also seems to partially determine the impact of a full Fragile X mutation on females. Each cell in a female will inactivate or turn off one of its two X chromosomes.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the Fragile X mutation, then most of the cells will have an active X chromosome that can produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be limited.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the working FMR1, then there will be few cells able to produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be more pronounced.  So the severity of Fragile X syndrome on a female depends in part on whether her cells turn off mainly X chromosomes with a good FMR1 or mainly X chromosomes with a defective FMR1.

A genetic counselor is a trained master’s level medical professional who works with individuals and families to:  Review genetic testing and diagnoses.  Review inheritance patterns.  Help identify possible carriers in the family.  Discuss the symptoms and features of Fragile X-associated Disorders.  When appropriate, review reproductive issues and options.  Make referrals and provide professional and emotional support.  Due to the complexity of Fragile X testing, the counselor is essential in the interpretation of results and for providing accurate information regarding Fragile X.   Where Do Genetic Counselors Work?  Genetic counselors can work either independently or are part of a medical team.  Some common settings where genetic counselors work are:  Medical genetics departments in a hospital/medical center setting.  Prenatal, perinatal or infertility care providers.  Specialist medical groups such as oncology, hematology, neurology, cardiology.  Multidisciplinary clinics such as craniofacial, skeletal dysplasia, Fragile X clinics.  Private practice.  Public and community health settings.  Genetics laboratories.  Support organizations (such as the NFXF).   Who Should Meet With a Genetic Counselor?  Anyone who:  Has been identified as being a “Fragile X carrier” or has positive, inconclusive or, in any way unusual Fragile X testing results.  Has a family member who has been identified as being a carrier of a Fragile X mutation.  Has a child or family member diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome or any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Has a family or personal  history of undiagnosed intellectual disabilities, autism or learning disorders.  Has symptoms of any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders, including infertility, early menopause and/or adult onset neurological or movement disorders.   What Will Likely Occur in a Genetic Counseling Session?  The counselor:  Will ask questions regarding the  medical or developmental/learning history of your family members (including children, parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, grandparents).  Will review the genetic implications of the diagnosis or test results.  May identify other family members who may have inherited the gene mutation.  May make suggestions or assist with informing or contacting family members regarding testing.  May meet with you either independently or in conjunction with a medical geneticist or other provider, who will likely examine your child or affected family member. If the counseling will be focused on carrier testing, an exam is often not indicated.  Can work with you and other family members to coordinate testing throughout the family.  Can provide information and help with decision-making regarding reproductive issues and options and coordinate/arrange any further testing.  Can make referrals to other providers for medical evaluations and care, prenatal care and  testing, therapies for your child, family counseling, or whatever needs you have at the time.   How Do You Find a Genetic Counselor in Your Area?  Ask your doctor or provider for a referral to a local genetic counselor.

I Was Just Figuring Out CGG Repeats! Most of us have heard of CGG repeats, those patterns of DNA molecules that are counted when testing for Fragile X (FMR1) mutations. (For background, see the Q & A with Dr. Karen Usdin on page 16.) We then hear a number like 400 for full mutations or 80 for premutations and that’s it, nothing else matters but that magic number. We envision a long tract of CGGCGGCGGCGG over and over again, as the genetic counselor or doctor described. But lately you may also have begun hearing about “AGG interruptions,” which in some way are related to Fragile X inheritance. This article will offer an overview of their importance.   To review some genetics, DNA is a strand of chemicals, called nucleotides. The nucleotides that make up DNA are Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine (abbreviated as A, T, C and G). So a CGG repeat is a triplet of cytosine, guanine and guanine. The pattern of nucleotides (like ATCGATCG, etc.) makes up a gene that instructs the cell on how to make or regulate proteins.  In the 1990s, after the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the CGG repeat expansion that causes Fragile X syndrome, Fragile X experts began talking about a different DNA pattern called an “AGG interruption,” which occurs between about every nine or 10 CGGs. In the normal Fragile X gene (five to 45 repeats), you might have a 30-CGG-repeat pattern that has 10 CGGs, one AGG, then 10 CGGs, then one AGG, then another 10 CGGs. These AGG interruptions act as a sort of anchor, keeping the 30-repeat FMR1 gene stable, like fence posts every 10 feet in a long fence.  As DNA samples were being studied by Fragile X researchers, they found that while some individuals had AGG interruptions every nine or 10 CGG repeats, some lost them as the repeats got bigger. So a person might have 10 CGGs then one AGG, 10 CGGs then one AGG, then 40 CGGs in an individual who has 60 CGG repeats.  This led to two questions regarding the presence or pattern of AGG interruptions: 1) Do the number or placement of AGG interruptions affect the stability of the FMR1 gene? 2) “Why do some premutations expand and some not?”  A recent study by Dr. Sarah Nolin at Institute of Basic Research in New York, Dr. Elizabeth Berry-Kravis at Rush Medical Center in Chicago and Asuragen Inc. in Austin, Texas was presented in a poster at the annual meeting of the American College on Medical Genetics earlier this year. The purpose of the study was to see how AGG interruptions affect the stability of the premutation, and also to develop (and use) the technology that would identify these AGG interruptions in Fragile X testing.  The study found that if there were 33 or fewer CGGs in a row beyond the last AGG, then the premutation usually didn’t expand. But when there were 39 or more CGGs in a row after the last AGG, without any AGG interruptions, then the premutation was usually unstable (expanding by one or more CGG repeats). This helps us understand why some premutations with, for example, 62 CGG repeats, appear stable over generations, whereas some with the same number of 62 repeats expand over subsequent generations. It’s because the one with a long tract (>39 repeats) of CGG repeats without an AGG “anchor” is more likely to expand than one with properly interspersed AGG interruptions.  The technology that was developed to identify the presence and placement of the AGG interruptions is new and exciting. Asuragen, in cooperation with the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute, has developed a unique type of PC test (see below) called “Amplidex.” It can identify the AGG interruptions in both males and females and in both normal and expanded FMR1 genes.  For scientific reasons, labs have had a hard time finding AGG interruptions, especially in women. This new technology overcomes these hurdles. Variations on a genetic testing method called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, reveal the number and location of AGG interruptions. Three different PCR studies done together show very different patterns of the CGG repeat region when AGG interruptions are present. Specially trained experts in a laboratory can review all three studies to solve the problem of where the AGG interruptions are located; the method is similar to solving a brainteaser puzzle.  This test is currently available only for research studies. Eventually it may be available for clinical use. So it is possible that in addition to the “magic number” of CGG repeats, the presence and placement of AGG interruptions will inform your risk for expansion of a premutation.  Why it Matters  There are a number of reasons why this issue of AGG interruptions is important.  First, if you or a family member have a premutation that hasn’t expanded to a full mutation, this technology may give you more accurate risk figures for that premutation to expand.  Second, it is possible that the number of AGG interruptions may contribute to or affect the risk for FXPOI or FXTAS. The risk for FXPOI is about 20–25 percent in female premutation carriers; the risk for FXTAS is about 30–40 percent in male and 5–8 percent in female carriers. At this point we don’t have good “predictors” of who may develop these two conditions. It is possible that this technology identifying AGG interruptions may lead us to better predict the group at highest (and lowest) risk for these Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Third, it is possible that our knowledge of AGG interruptions might lead to better understanding of the small subset of children with premutations who have developmental disorders like autism, ADHD, etc. We know this is clearly a small group, since most premutation carriers exhibit normal development and cognitive function. However, there is a small subset of (mostly male) children in the premutation range who have developmental/behavioral disorders, and this new technology might give us some clues as to why they are affected, even though most carriers are not.  All of which leads to the possibility that you may soon hear, “I have 65 repeats with three AGG interruptions, ya-hoo!”       Copyright 2017 National Fragile X Foundation 1861 International Drive Suite 200, McLean, VA  22102, (800) 688-8765 Powered by PRI .

There have been a number of studies aimed at determining the prevalence of FXS in males and females. Studies have been undertaken both in the “special needs” population and the general population. The agreed upon prevalence of FXS in males is approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 and in females is approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000.  The reason it is lower in females is that, while all males with an FMR1 full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome, some females with an FMR1 full mutation will not have behavioral, cognitive or physical features of FXS.   How Many Individuals are Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation?  According to a 2012 study by the CDC , the frequency of Fragile X premutation is as follows:  1 in 151 females, or about 1 million women in the United States.  1 in 468 males, or about 320,000 men in the United States.  These statistics are important because both men and women are at risk for having symptoms linked to Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Women with a premutation reported their last menstrual cycle at an earlier age than women without a premutation (48 vs. 51 years).  Men and women with a premutation were more than four times as likely to report dizziness or fainting as people without a premutation (18% vs. 4%). Men and women with a premutation were more than twice as likely to report numbness as people without a premutation (29% vs. 13%).  This study of 6,747 older adults in Wisconsin found 30 people with a change in the FMR1 gene. Based on this relatively small number of people, the results should be interpreted with caution. These findings may not reflect all people in the United States with an FMR1 premutation For example a large Israeli study found approximately 1/130 women were FMR1 carriers.   Prevalence of FXTAS  Current estimates suggest that about 30-40% of male FMR1 premutation carriers over 50 years of age, within families already known to have someone with Fragile X, will ultimately exhibit some features of FXTAS.  This figure may be as low as 10-20% in the general population, since the majority of carriers have a premutation in the lower range of CGG repeats, where the occurrence of FXTAS appears to be reduced.  Though there are specific diagnostic criteria for FXTAS , some men may only exhibit some of the symptoms, and may not develop all of the cardinal features of the condition.  For men who are premutation carriers, the chance of developing core symptoms of FXTAS (tremor, problems with walking/balance) increases with age.  From age 50-59 the chance is about 17%.  From age 60-69 about 38%.  From age 70-79 about 47%.  Over 80 years old, about 75% will develop symptoms of FXTAS.  Studies of females have found that about 8-16% of premutation carriers, within families already known to have someone with a Fragile X condition, develop some FXTAS symptoms. The symptoms in females tend to be milder.  FXTAS may be one of the most common adult onset, single-gene neurological diseases; similar in prevalence to other neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease); however more studies within the general population will be necessary before the true incidence is known.   Prevalence of FXPOI  Approximately 20-25% of women with an FMR1 premutation will develop FXPOI . FXPOI covers a range of ovarian difficulties including early menopause, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, sub fertility and premature ovarian failure (cessation of menstrual periods prior to age 40)   How Common are Intermediate (Grey Area) Alleles?  Approximately 1 in 50 (2%) of individuals have an intermediate allele . There appear to be no clinical associations with intermediate alleles. Most intermediate alleles are stable and do not change over generations. In a small number of families intermediate alleles show some slight instability and can lead to a premutation in future generations. Individuals with an intermediate allele are not at risk for any for the FXDs or to have children with Fragile X syndrome.  Based on the best available evidence:  Approximately 1 million Americans carry the Fragile X mutation, including approximately 100,000 with Fragile X syndrome, and are at risk for developing a Fragile X-associated Disorder.  Approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: The vast majority of males with the full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: Approximately 50% of females with the full mutation will have some features of Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 468 men in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.  Approximately 1 in 151 women in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.       male chromosomes   Female Chromosomes     Genetics and Inheritance        What Are Chromosomes?  Our bodies are made up of about 60 trillion cells. Each one of those cells manufactures proteins. The kinds of proteins any given cell makes determine its particular characteristics, which in turn create the characteristics of the entire body.  The instructions for making these proteins are stored in chemicals or molecules called DNA, which is organized into chromosomes. Chromosomes are found in the center, or nucleus, of all of our cells, including the eggs and sperm.  Chromosomes are passed down from generation to generation through the egg and sperm. Typically, we all have 46 chromosomes in our cells, two of which are sex chromosomes. In females, these are two Xs; in males they are an X and a Y.    The Role of Genes?  Genes are sections of DNA that are passed from generation to generation and perform one function. If we think of DNA as letters in the alphabet, the genes are words and the chromosome is a full sentence. All 46 chromosomes then make up the whole book.  There are many genes on each chromosome; we all have tens of thousands of genes that instruct our bodies on how to develop.  Genes are given names to identify them and the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome is called FMR1. The FMR1 Gene is on the X chromosome.    How Do Changes in the FMR1 Gene Lead to FXS?  The FMR1 gene appears in four forms that are defined by the number of repeats of a pattern of DNA called CGG repeats.  Individuals with less than 45 CGG repeats have a normal FMR1 gene. Those with 45-54 CGG repeats have what is called an “intermediate” or “grey zone allele,” which does not cause any of the known Fragile X associated disorders.  Individuals with 55-200 CGG repeats have a “premutation,” which means they carry an unstable mutation of the gene that can expand in future generations and thus cause Fragile X syndrome in their children or grandchildren. Individuals with a premutation can also develop FXTAS or FXPOI themselves.  Individuals with over 200 CGG repeats have a full mutation of the FMR1 gene, which causes Fragile X syndrome.  The full mutation causes the FMR1 gene to shut down or “methylate” in one region. Normally, the FMR1 gene produces an important protein called FMRP. When the gene is turned off, the individual does not make this protein. The lack of this specific protein is what causes Fragile X syndrome.    The Fragile X Premutation  Fragile X-associated Disorders are a group of conditions called trinucleotide repeat disorders. A common feature of these conditions is that the gene can change sizes over generations, becoming more unstable, and thus the conditions may occur more frequently or severely in subsequent generations. These conditions are often caused by a gene change that begins with a premutation and then expands to a full mutation in subsequent generations.  Approximately 1 in 151 females and 1 in 468 males carry the FMR1 premutation. They are thus “carriers” of the premutation.  Premutations are defined as having 55-200 CGG repeats and can occur in both males and females. When a father passes the premutation on to his daughters, it usually does not expand to a full mutation. A man never passes the Fragile X gene to his sons, since he passes only his Y chromosome to them, which does not contain a Fragile X gene.  A female with the FMR1 premutation will often pass on a larger version of the mutation to her children (more on this point below). She also has a 50 percent chance of passing on her normal X chromosome in each pregnancy, since usually only one of her X chromosomes has the FMR1 mutation.  The chance of the premutation expanding to a full mutation is related to the size of the mother’s premutation. The larger the mother’s CGG repeat number, the higher the chance that it will expand to a full mutation if it is passed on.  Typically, the premutation has no immediate and observable impact on a person’s appearance or health. However, some females with a premutation will experience Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) , which causes infertility, irregular or missed menstrual cycles, and/or early menopause.  Additionally, some older adults with a premutation may develop a neurological condition called FXTAS , (Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder.  FXTAS and FXPOI are part of the family of conditions called Fragile X-associated Disorders.    The FMR1 Full Mutation  A full mutation is defined as having over 200 CGG repeats and causes that indicate the presence of Fragile X syndrome in males and some females. Most full mutation expansions have some degree of Methylation (the process which “turns off” the gene). Males with a full mutation will have Fragile X Syndrome , though with varying degrees of severity  About 65-70 percent of females with a full mutation exhibit some difficulties with cognitive, learning, behavioral, or social functioning, and may also have some of the physical features of FXS (such as large ears or a long face). The remaining 30-35 percent are at risk to develop mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, or they may have no observable effects of the full mutation.    Inheritance  Fragile X in an “X-linked” condition, which means that the gene is on the X chromosome.  Since a woman has two X chromosomes a woman with a premutation or full mutation has a 50% chance of passing on the X with the mutation in each pregnancy, and a 50% chance of passing on her normal X.  If she has a premutation, and it is passed on (to either males or females), it can remain a premutation or it can expand to a full mutation. If she has a full mutation and it is passed on (to either males or females), it will remain a full mutation.  Because males have only one X chromosome, fathers who carry the premutation will pass it on to all their daughters and none of their sons (they pass their Y chromosome on to their sons). There have been no reports of premutations that are passed from a father to his daughter expanding to a full mutation. This appears to only occur when passed from a mother to her children.    Unique Features of Fragile X Inheritance  In many X-linked conditions only males who inherit the abnormal gene are affected. Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked conditions that can also affect females.  Additionally, in other X-linked conditions all males who carry the abnormal form of the gene are affected. In Fragile X syndrome, unaffected males can carry the gene in the premutation form while themselves having no symptoms of the condition.        FMR1 Gene    What Is a Gene?  A gene is a unit of heredity that is passed down from parent to child. Genes are located on chromosomes that are in all of our cells, including the sperm and egg that make a baby.   What Is a Gene Made Of?  Genes are made of molecules or chemicals called DNA. The pattern of DNA will determine if the gene is working properly. The DNA has to be in a certain pattern or order, like the numbers in a phone number.   How Does a Gene Work?  A gene has different parts that work together like a factory or machine. It has a “promoter” that turns the gene on, like a light switch. It has sections that are just “filler” and act as place holders, called “introns.” The sections that are used to make a protein or do a job are called “exons.”   What Do Genes Do?  The job of a gene is to either make a protein, the building blocks of all the structures in the body, or to regulate other proteins in the body.   How Does a Gene Make Proteins?  The DNA in the gene is a code that is “transcribed” or “talks” to another kind of molecule called RNA. This is like one side of Velcro sticking to another that it matches up to. The RNA then “translates” the DNA to put together the protein.     Now that you understand what genes are, let’s discuss the Fragile X gene…   The Fragile X ( FMR1 ) Gene   Why Is It Called the FMR1 Gene?  Genes are named when they are discovered. Often the name isn’t exactly the same as the condition, in case it is later discovered that there is more than one gene involved in the condition. The gene that causes Fragile X is called the “ FMR1 gene,” which stands for Fragile X mental retardation gene. Though the term “mental retardation” has given way in recent years to the more generally accepted term of “intellectual disabilities,” the scientific name of the gene can’t change with the times.    Ideogram of X chromosome    Where Is the FMR1 Gene Located?  The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome. We all have 46 chromosomes in all of our cells, 44 of which are numbered 1-22 in pairs. Then females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Each chromosome has two arms, one called the “p” arm (the short arm) and one called the “q” arm (the long arm).  There are many genes on each chromosome, like houses on a street. Each gene is given an address, depending on where it lies on the chromosome. The address of the FMR1 gene is Xq27.3   Does Everyone Have an FMR1 Gene?  Yes, everyone has an FMR1 gene. When someone states, “I have the gene for Fragile X,” they really mean they have a gene mutation for Fragile X. Some Fragile X genes are normal and some are not.   What Does the FMR1 Gene Do?  The FMR1 gene makes a very important protein called FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein). Though this protein is found in all our cells, it is most abundant in the nerve cells, and particularly in a part of the nerve cell that “talks” to other nerve cells called “dendrites.”    What Is an FMR1 Gene Mutation?  A mutation is any change in a gene. Some mutations don’t cause any problems and we don’t know about them (unless found in the laboratory). Mutations in the FMR1 gene involve an abnormal expansion of the DNA in the “promoter” area of the gene. Often a mutation causes decreased or absent protein production. In individuals with a “ full mutation ,” their FMR1 gene is shut down and they don’t make enough or any FMRP.   Are There Different Kinds of FMR1 Mutations?  Yes. An individual can have a normal FMR1 gene, a “ premutation ” or a “ full mutation .” There is also another category called an “intermediate allele,” which is not a true mutation, but an expansion somewhere between the “normal” FMR1 gene and the premutation.   What Is the Difference Between These Mutations?    FMR1 Gene Categories   The mutation of the FMR1 gene involves a repeating pattern of DNA called a “CGG repeat.” DNA is made of molecules that are abbreviated A, C, G and T. A CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene is a pattern of DNA that may repeats itself anywhere from 30 to 1000 times. In the FMR1 gene there is an area of the promoter that is rich in these CGG repeats and is measured when Fragile X testing is performed.  In this area, there is normally about 30 repeats of CGG. In individuals with the premutation, there are from 55-200 of these repeats. Persons with the full mutation have more than 200 of the CGG repeats. When there is more than 200 CGG repeats, the gene is turned off by a process called Methylation .  Methylation happens to other genes too, when they are supposed to be turned off (as in the genes we don’t use, like those that make a tail grow!). In Fragile X the methylation turns off the FMR1 gene, so no FMRP is produced. This is what causes Fragile X Syndrome .   FMRP – The Fragile X Protein   Each cell works somewhat like a factory. The external membrane functions as the exterior walls of the factory. The nucleus stores the genetic blueprints in the form of DNA. The machinery (ribosomes) for assembling the products (proteins) is attached to the shop floor (endoplasmic reticulum). The Golgi concentrates the proteins to export them. The lysosome is used for waste disposal and recycling.   What Do Proteins Do?    Used with permission of Paul Thiessen Chemical Graphics   The body makes about 50,000 different kinds of protein. These proteins serve in two major roles. Some of them make up part of the structure of our bodies. Others are enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that works like a tool. It helps a particular chemical reaction take place.  For example, there is a particular enzyme that breaks apart starch into sugar molecules; you use it in your small intestine to digest your carbohydrates. Another enzyme takes a sugar molecule and adds a phosphate onto it to make it unstable. Then a series of about 20 more enzymes each process the unstable sugar molecule in a disassembly line that pulls the sugar molecule apart and releases energy.  Proteins are made out of 20 different amino acids like leucine, lysine, tryptophan, etc. When you eat foods that contain proteins, the first thing your digestive system does is to break them down into amino acids. Then you assemble those amino acids into your own proteins. In a way, it is like words. You can make all kinds of words out of 26 letters. You could take a magazine, cut apart all of the letters and reassemble them into your own words. The proteins you make are assembled out of the parts from the proteins you digested from your food.  Fragile X syndrome is caused because people with the disease don’t make a particular protein, FMRP. Sometimes someone asks why we can’t just feed a person with Fragile X more protein. The problem is not lack of protein; a bunch of proteins won’t help someone who is missing FMRP. It is a specific protein that is missing, not proteins in general.  To understand this, think about someone who is trying to say the word “frozen”. Handing the person a list of names from the phone book won’t help. In the same way, having someone eat a bunch of proteins won’t give the person the specific protein that is needed.  Even if we injected that person with lots of FMRP, it would not help. FMRP needs to be present in the right cells at the right time in the right amount.  We are just beginning to learn which cells normally make FMRP. We have some clues about what the function of FMRP is but we have much to learn.    Used with Permission of Dennis Kunkel’s Image Gallery   The synthesis of a protein such as FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein) begins in the nucleus of the cell when the DNA receives a request for that specific information. It is a bit like someone going to a library and selecting a particular book. In response to the request, the DNA opens up and a copy of the coded information is transcribed, much like someone photocopies a chapter of a book in a library. That copy of the DNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA).  The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes out to the main part of the cell, the cytoplasm. There the coded mRNA is translated on ribosomes with the help of transfer RNA and a protein is assembled out of amino acids.  The protein takes on a particular shape that allows it to perform very specific tasks. While we know the tasks of some of the proteins that humans make, we only have hints about the role of FMRP.   Methylation     Used with permission of New England Biolabs   One of the ways the cells control which genetic information they will use is to chemically modify the DNA. The illustration on the left shows an enzyme (diagrammed in ribbons) adding methyl groups to some of the DNA (balls in the form of a double helix). This inactivates that part of the chromosome. It’s as if we were to put glue on the edges of some of the books in the library; those pages would become unavailable to readers.   Good methylation  In females methylation is used regularly to solve a problem. Men have only one X chromosome and women have two. As a result, female cells might be expected to make twice as much protein from the information on X chromosomes as males do. Instead, women’s cells randomly pick one of the X chromosomes and turn it off by methylation. Thus both males and females have one working X chromosome in each cell and as a result, one working unit of all the genetic information on the X chromosome.   Bad methylation  As noted above, methylation is generally a useful method for turning off chromosomal information. However, in Fragile X syndrome, methylation is involved in causing the disease. Near the FMR1 Gene is a regulatory site called a CpG island. In most people, the site is not methylated. As a result, the cell can use the FMR1 gene when there is a need for FMRP – The Fragile X Protein .  In people with Fragile X syndrome, the CpG island is methylated. As a result, the cell is unable to copy the information in the FMR1 gene. Since an mRNA copy is not made, FMRP will not be synthesized. Since there is no FMRP at the time and place it is needed, the characteristics of Fragile X syndrome are set in motion.   It’s not really the CGG’s  Much of the focus on Fragile X syndrome is on the expansion of the repeated CGG’s . It is technically not the expansion that directly causes the problem. Instead, having more than 230 CGG repeats sets in motion methylation of part of the FMR1 gene. The methylation stops the synthesis of FMRP and the absence of FMRP causes Fragile X syndrome. We do not know why having too many CGG repeats triggers methylation.  In theory, if the methylation could be removed from that spot on the FMR1 gene, it could allow access to the FMR1 gene and allow its FMRP product to be assembled. This is one of the potential treatment areas that researchers are investigating.   Mosaic females  The inactivation of female X chromosomes by methylation mentioned above, also seems to partially determine the impact of a full Fragile X mutation on females. Each cell in a female will inactivate or turn off one of its two X chromosomes.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the Fragile X mutation, then most of the cells will have an active X chromosome that can produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be limited.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the working FMR1, then there will be few cells able to produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be more pronounced.  So the severity of Fragile X syndrome on a female depends in part on whether her cells turn off mainly X chromosomes with a good FMR1 or mainly X chromosomes with a defective FMR1.   What Is Genetic Counseling?       What Does a Genetic Counselor Do?  A genetic counselor is a trained master’s level medical professional who works with individuals and families to:  Review genetic testing and diagnoses.  Review inheritance patterns.  Help identify possible carriers in the family.  Discuss the symptoms and features of Fragile X-associated Disorders.  When appropriate, review reproductive issues and options.  Make referrals and provide professional and emotional support.  Due to the complexity of Fragile X testing, the counselor is essential in the interpretation of results and for providing accurate information regarding Fragile X.   Where Do Genetic Counselors Work?  Genetic counselors can work either independently or are part of a medical team.  Some common settings where genetic counselors work are:  Medical genetics departments in a hospital/medical center setting.  Prenatal, perinatal or infertility care providers.  Specialist medical groups such as oncology, hematology, neurology, cardiology.  Multidisciplinary clinics such as craniofacial, skeletal dysplasia, Fragile X clinics.  Private practice.  Public and community health settings.  Genetics laboratories.  Support organizations (such as the NFXF).   Who Should Meet With a Genetic Counselor?  Anyone who:  Has been identified as being a “Fragile X carrier” or has positive, inconclusive or, in any way unusual Fragile X testing results.  Has a family member who has been identified as being a carrier of a Fragile X mutation.  Has a child or family member diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome or any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Has a family or personal  history of undiagnosed intellectual disabilities, autism or learning disorders.  Has symptoms of any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders, including infertility, early menopause and/or adult onset neurological or movement disorders.   What Will Likely Occur in a Genetic Counseling Session?  The counselor:  Will ask questions regarding the  medical or developmental/learning history of your family members (including children, parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, grandparents).  Will review the genetic implications of the diagnosis or test results.  May identify other family members who may have inherited the gene mutation.  May make suggestions or assist with informing or contacting family members regarding testing.  May meet with you either independently or in conjunction with a medical geneticist or other provider, who will likely examine your child or affected family member. If the counseling will be focused on carrier testing, an exam is often not indicated.  Can work with you and other family members to coordinate testing throughout the family.  Can provide information and help with decision-making regarding reproductive issues and options and coordinate/arrange any further testing.  Can make referrals to other providers for medical evaluations and care, prenatal care and  testing, therapies for your child, family counseling, or whatever needs you have at the time.   How Do You Find a Genetic Counselor in Your Area?  Ask your doctor or provider for a referral to a local genetic counselor.

I Was Just Figuring Out CGG Repeats! Most of us have heard of CGG repeats, those patterns of DNA molecules that are counted when testing for Fragile X (FMR1) mutations. (For background, see the Q & A with Dr. Karen Usdin on page 16.) We then hear a number like 400 for full mutations or 80 for premutations and that’s it, nothing else matters but that magic number. We envision a long tract of CGGCGGCGGCGG over and over again, as the genetic counselor or doctor described. But lately you may also have begun hearing about “AGG interruptions,” which in some way are related to Fragile X inheritance. This article will offer an overview of their importance.   To review some genetics, DNA is a strand of chemicals, called nucleotides. The nucleotides that make up DNA are Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine (abbreviated as A, T, C and G). So a CGG repeat is a triplet of cytosine, guanine and guanine. The pattern of nucleotides (like ATCGATCG, etc.) makes up a gene that instructs the cell on how to make or regulate proteins.  In the 1990s, after the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the CGG repeat expansion that causes Fragile X syndrome, Fragile X experts began talking about a different DNA pattern called an “AGG interruption,” which occurs between about every nine or 10 CGGs. In the normal Fragile X gene (five to 45 repeats), you might have a 30-CGG-repeat pattern that has 10 CGGs, one AGG, then 10 CGGs, then one AGG, then another 10 CGGs. These AGG interruptions act as a sort of anchor, keeping the 30-repeat FMR1 gene stable, like fence posts every 10 feet in a long fence.  As DNA samples were being studied by Fragile X researchers, they found that while some individuals had AGG interruptions every nine or 10 CGG repeats, some lost them as the repeats got bigger. So a person might have 10 CGGs then one AGG, 10 CGGs then one AGG, then 40 CGGs in an individual who has 60 CGG repeats.  This led to two questions regarding the presence or pattern of AGG interruptions: 1) Do the number or placement of AGG interruptions affect the stability of the FMR1 gene? 2) “Why do some premutations expand and some not?”  A recent study by Dr. Sarah Nolin at Institute of Basic Research in New York, Dr. Elizabeth Berry-Kravis at Rush Medical Center in Chicago and Asuragen Inc. in Austin, Texas was presented in a poster at the annual meeting of the American College on Medical Genetics earlier this year. The purpose of the study was to see how AGG interruptions affect the stability of the premutation, and also to develop (and use) the technology that would identify these AGG interruptions in Fragile X testing.  The study found that if there were 33 or fewer CGGs in a row beyond the last AGG, then the premutation usually didn’t expand. But when there were 39 or more CGGs in a row after the last AGG, without any AGG interruptions, then the premutation was usually unstable (expanding by one or more CGG repeats). This helps us understand why some premutations with, for example, 62 CGG repeats, appear stable over generations, whereas some with the same number of 62 repeats expand over subsequent generations. It’s because the one with a long tract (>39 repeats) of CGG repeats without an AGG “anchor” is more likely to expand than one with properly interspersed AGG interruptions.  The technology that was developed to identify the presence and placement of the AGG interruptions is new and exciting. Asuragen, in cooperation with the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute, has developed a unique type of PC test (see below) called “Amplidex.” It can identify the AGG interruptions in both males and females and in both normal and expanded FMR1 genes.  For scientific reasons, labs have had a hard time finding AGG interruptions, especially in women. This new technology overcomes these hurdles. Variations on a genetic testing method called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, reveal the number and location of AGG interruptions. Three different PCR studies done together show very different patterns of the CGG repeat region when AGG interruptions are present. Specially trained experts in a laboratory can review all three studies to solve the problem of where the AGG interruptions are located; the method is similar to solving a brainteaser puzzle.  This test is currently available only for research studies. Eventually it may be available for clinical use. So it is possible that in addition to the “magic number” of CGG repeats, the presence and placement of AGG interruptions will inform your risk for expansion of a premutation.  Why it Matters  There are a number of reasons why this issue of AGG interruptions is important.  First, if you or a family member have a premutation that hasn’t expanded to a full mutation, this technology may give you more accurate risk figures for that premutation to expand.  Second, it is possible that the number of AGG interruptions may contribute to or affect the risk for FXPOI or FXTAS. The risk for FXPOI is about 20–25 percent in female premutation carriers; the risk for FXTAS is about 30–40 percent in male and 5–8 percent in female carriers. At this point we don’t have good “predictors” of who may develop these two conditions. It is possible that this technology identifying AGG interruptions may lead us to better predict the group at highest (and lowest) risk for these Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Third, it is possible that our knowledge of AGG interruptions might lead to better understanding of the small subset of children with premutations who have developmental disorders like autism, ADHD, etc. We know this is clearly a small group, since most premutation carriers exhibit normal development and cognitive function. However, there is a small subset of (mostly male) children in the premutation range who have developmental/behavioral disorders, and this new technology might give us some clues as to why they are affected, even though most carriers are not.  All of which leads to the possibility that you may soon hear, “I have 65 repeats with three AGG interruptions, ya-hoo!”       Copyright 2017 National Fragile X Foundation 1861 International Drive Suite 200, McLean, VA  22102, (800) 688-8765 Powered by PRI .

Genes determine many things about the person. For example, what the person will look like and whether he or she is likely to have certain illnesses. In addition, genes have instructions for making proteins in the cells. Proteins are needed for the body to work correctly.  FXS is caused by a change in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The FMR1 gene makes a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that is needed for normal brain development.  Chromosomes  Genes are found on chromosomes. Every human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. People get their chromosomes from their parents. People get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from their father. The chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They decide if a person is male or female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).  The FMR1 gene is on the X chromosome.  DNA  The chromosomes and genes have a special code called DNA. DNA has four chemical letters, called “bases”: A, C, T, and G. The order of the letters determines the information carried in each gene, like the way that a specific pattern of letters makes up the words in a sentence.  How FXS is Inherited  There is a place in the FMR1 gene where the DNA pattern CGG is repeated over and over again. In most people, the number of repeats is small (5 to 44 repeats), which is normal. If the number of repeats is too large (more than 200 repeats), the gene turns off. When the gene is turned off, no protein is made. Without the protein, the person develops FXS. This is called a “trinucleotide repeat disorder.” People get (inherit) the disorder from their parents.

Normal: 5 to 44 Repeats  Most people have about 5 to 44 repeats of the letters CGG in their FMR1 genes. This is considered a normal number of repeats. People with a normal number of repeats do not have FXS and are not at risk for having children with FXS.  Intermediate: 45 to 54 Repeats  People who have an intermediate number of repeats (about 45 to 54) do not have FXS. However, they may have a slightly higher chance of having some symptoms.  Premutation: 55 to 200 Repeats  People who have a premutation (about 55 to 200 repeats) do not have FXS. However, they might have another fragile X-associated disorder and related concerns . In addition, people with a premutation can have children with a premutation or full mutation (FXS).   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing the premutation or full mutation on to their child (daughters or sons). The more CGG repeats the mother has, the more likely her child will have full mutation fragile X.  Men will have daughters with a premutation, but sons will not be affected.   Full Mutation (FXS): More than 200 Repeats  People with a full mutation (more than 200 repeats) have FXS.   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing fragile X on to their child (sons or daughters).

One Gene Shuts Down    Fragile X is caused by a mutation in a single gene. In people with Fragile X, a defect (a full mutation) turns the gene off. Like a defective factory, it cannot manufacture the protein that it normally makes.    Fragile X Syndrome is a Common Rare Disease    Fragile X affects 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 6000 females of all races and ethnic groups (source CDC ). About 1 in 259 women carry fragile X and could pass it to their children. About 1 in 800 men carry Fragile X; their daughters will also be carriers.  Fragile X syndrome is the #1 inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and the most common known cause of autism worldwide. Most people with Fragile X are not yet diagnosed.          Fragile X is Inherited    A mother who carries Fragile X has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her children. Her children will either be carriers or they will be have Fragile X syndrome.  Carrier men will pass the premutation to all their daughters but none of their sons. These daughters are carriers but they do not have Fragile X syndrome.  The Fragile X premutation can be passed silently down through generations in a family before a child is born with the syndrome.  More About Genes and Inheritance  Each cell in the body contains forty-six (twenty-three pairs of) chromosomes. These chromosomes consist of genetic material (DNA) necessary for the production of proteins which lead to growth, development and physical and intellectual characteristics. The first twenty-two pairs of chromosomes are the same in males and females. The remaining two chromosomes, X and Y, determine whether a person is male or female. Males have only one X chromosome which is inherited from the mother. They receive a Y chromosome from the father. Females inherit two X chromosomes, one from each parent.    Simple Cause, Complex Disease    This gene, called FMR1 for Fragile X Mental Retardation–1 , was discovered in 1991 by Drs. Ben Oostra, David Nelson, and Stephen Warren. Drs. Oostra, Nelson, and Warren named this mutation FRAXA . It causes almost all cases of Fragile X syndrome.    The Fragile X Gene    The FMR1 gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome. At the start of this gene lies a region of DNA which varies in length from one person to another. Ordinarily, this stretch of DNA falls within a range of length that would be considered “normal”. In some people, however, this stretch of DNA is somewhat longer; this gene change is a premutation . This stretch of DNA is prone to further expansion when it is passed from a woman to her children.      When the stretch of DNA expands beyond a certain length, the gene is switched off and does not produce the protein that it is normally makes. This gene change is called a full mutation . A male who inherits a full mutation exhibits Fragile X syndrome because his only X chromosome contains the mutated gene. A female may not be as severely affected because each cell of her body needs to use only one of its two X chromosomes and randomly inactivates the other.    Carriers, FXTAS, and POI    Carriers have a small mutation in FMR1 (a premutation ). Carriers do not show symptoms of fragile X syndrome, but they may be at risk for related disorders such as Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). Women who carry Fragile X may be at risk for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency which causes early menopause.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a study in 2012 which pegs the prevalence of carriers at:   1 in 151 females, or about 1 million women in the United States.  1 in 468 males, or about 320,000 men in the United States.

Description        Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Usually, males are more severely affected by this disorder than females. Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age 2. Most males with fragile X syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while about one-third of affected females are intellectually disabled. Children with fragile X syndrome may also have anxiety and hyperactive behavior such as fidgeting or impulsive actions. They may have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which includes an impaired ability to maintain attention and difficulty focusing on specific tasks. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction. Seizures occur in about 15 percent of males and about 5 percent of females with fragile X syndrome . Most males and about half of females with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that become more apparent with age. These features include a long and narrow face , large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet , and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after puberty.      Related Information    What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family? What is the prognosis of a genetic condition? Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center          Frequency        Fragile X syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.      Related Information    What information about a genetic condition can statistics provide? Why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethnic groups?          Genetic Changes        Mutations in the FMR1 gene cause fragile X syndrome . The FMR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP. This protein helps regulate the production of other proteins and plays a role in the development of synapses , which are specialized connections between nerve cells. Synapses are critical for relaying nerve impulses. Nearly all cases of fragile X syndrome are caused by a mutation in which a DNA segment, known as the CGG triplet repeat, is expanded within the FMR1 gene. Normally, this DNA segment is repeated from 5 to about 40 times. In people with fragile X syndrome , however, the CGG segment is repeated more than 200 times. The abnormally expanded CGG segment turns off (silences) the FMR1 gene, which prevents the gene from producing FMRP. Loss or a shortage (deficiency) of this protein disrupts nervous system functions and leads to the signs and symptoms of fragile X syndrome . Males and females with 55 to 200 repeats of the CGG segment are said to have an FMR1 gene premutation. Most people with a premutation are intellectually normal. In some cases, however, individuals with a premutation have lower than normal amounts of FMRP. As a result, they may have mild versions of the physical features seen in fragile X syndrome (such as prominent ears) and may experience emotional problems such as anxiety or depression. Some children with a premutation may have learning disabilities or autistic-like behavior. The premutation is also associated with an increased risk of disorders called fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).

How can gene mutations affect health and development? More about Mutations and Health          Inheritance Pattern        Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern . A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome , one of the two sex chromosomes. (The Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome.) The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. X-linked dominant means that in females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome ), a mutation in the only copy of a gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. In women, the FMR1 gene premutation on the X chromosome can expand to more than 200 CGG repeats in cells that develop into eggs. This means that women with the premutation have an increased risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome . By contrast, the premutation in men does not expand to more than 200 repeats as it is passed to the next generation. Men pass the premutation only to their daughters. Their sons receive a Y chromosome , which does not include the FMR1 gene.      Related Information    What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?

Diseases          Back to Diseases           English   Español       Hi. My wife is a carrier of fragile X, with 80 repeats on one X. (There is no history of Fragile X in her family, and our son is not affected.)  What are the chances that our children will have fragile X?  Just a side question, her father has green/red color blindness. Could this have any significance? Assuming the Fragile X was inherited from her mother, does this mean our sons would all either have the Fragile X gene or be colorblind?       -A curious adult from Israel  With your wife's premutation (see below), there is a 30-40% risk of your son, and probably your daughter, of having a full mutation.  However, while nearly all boys with the full mutation will show signs of the disease, only half of the girls will.  Fragile X is the most common form of inherited mental retardation.  About 1 in 4000 males have Fragile X, while only half as many females have it.  Fragile X is caused by mutation of a gene on the X chromosome called FMR-1.  We don't know exactly what FMR-1 does, but it may be involved in forming the brain.  Males who inherit the mutation are always affected because they only have one X chromosome.  (Remember, females have two X chromosomes, males an X and a Y.)  In females the outcome is variable.  About half of women who inherit the mutation have the disease.  Usually it is a milder form than that seen in males.  In other cases, the normal X chromosome provides enough FMR-1 protein to prevent brain defects.  So how does someone get Fragile X?  Fragile X happens when a certain part of the FMR-1 gene gets too long.  There is a part of the gene that normally has between 6 and 54 repeats of the same 3 bases.  For most people, the number of repeats stays pretty stable.  Then, for reasons we don't understand, the number of repeats begins to increase.  When the number of repeats is above 55, the gene is now said to have a premutation.  A premutation is pretty unstable and the number of repeats increases over generations.  Once there are 200 or so repeats, the symptoms of the disease kick in.  What happens at 200 repeats is that no FMR-1 protein is made from that copy of the gene.  All those repeats act like a skip in a record that blocks the song from finishing.  The DNA can't be read through to make the FMR-1 protein.  As you can probably tell, Fragile X inheritance is pretty complicated.  The bottom line is that you can only get the full mutation from your mother.  A premutation passed through a father usually expands only a little or not at all.  So, his daughters will also have a premutation on one of their X chromosomes.  His sons inherit his Y chromosome--no Fragile X risk!  With moms, it is a different story.  In female carriers, the repeat sequences can expand when passed down to her children.  Can a geneticist say when a premutation will turn into a full mutation?  Regrettably, that's not possible with current tests.  However, the longer the premutation, the greater the risk of expansion to full mutation size.  Females with the full mutation have a 50% chance of passing that mutation to their children.  Since she can't get an X with the mutation from her dad, she can only have one X with the mutation at a time.  Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the X with the mutation.  Most of the possible combinations are outlined in the table below.  Father  Mother  Son  Daughter  XY No disease  XX No disease  XY No disease  XX No disease  X pre Y Carrier  XX No disease  XY No disease  X pre X Carrier  XY No disease  X pre X Carrier  X pre Y XY 50% chance of either carrier or Fragile X  X pre X XX 50% chance of either carrier or Fragile X  XY No disease  X mut X 50% chance of having Fragile X  X mut Y XY 50% chance of Fragile X  X mut X XX 50% chance of mutation, 25% chance of Fragile X  (This is oversimplified a bit as the actual percentages are lower.  This is because of something called mosaicism which is fairly common with Fragile X.  To learn more about mosaicism, go to mosaicism in the GeneTests glossary .)  Now if you really want to get into colorblindness, keep reading!  The gene that causes red/green color blindness is located on the X chromosome, like the Fragile X gene.  You are right to suggest that your sons will inherit one of your wife's two X chromosomes, with either a Fragile X mutation, or the color blindness gene.  The four possible combinations are diagrammed.  Sons (XY) will be either colorblind (ColBl), or inherit an abnormal Fragile X (FraX) gene.  Daughters, XX, will be carriers for either the colorblind mutation or Fragile X.  While one color blindness gene in a female will have no effect, the Fragile X gene could cause disease.  How is color blindness inherited?  It is a recessive trait, meaning that as long as one good copy of the gene is around, color vision is normal.  Since males have only one X chromosome, they are always affected by color blindness if they inherit a mutant gene.  Females have two Xs so they are rarely affected.  It can happen though, if they inherit a mutant gene from both their father (who would be colorblind) and their mother (who is a carrier).  So, while the genes for red-green color blindness and Fragile X are both located on the X chromosome, they are inherited differently. The outcome for color blindness is predictable. An abnormal Fragile X gene is unstable and can change in each generation.

Did I do anything to cause fragile X syndrome? No. There is nothing you did before or during the pregnancy or after your child was born to cause fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is genetic which means it is caused by a change in a gene, in this case, the FMR1 gene. The change causes the gene not to work the way it should, leading to the problems seen in fragile X syndrome.  Because fragile X syndrome is genetic, it can be passed on and you are at risk for having another child with fragile X syndrome. It is important to know that you have no control over whether this change gets passed on to your child or not. In addition, other family members may also be at risk of having children with fragile X syndrome, so it is important to inform them of your child's diagnosis.   2. What does cause fragile X syndrome? Explaining how fragile X happens is not very easy simply because of the way it is inherited. To start, let's talk broadly about genes and chromosomes. Genes are the instructions that tell our bodies how to work and are made up of DNA. We inherit two copies of all of our genes: one copy from our mother and one copy from our father. The DNA is packed into larger structures called chromosomes, and each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of genes. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. The first 22 pairs are the same in males and females and are called the autosomes. The 23rd pair, called the sex chromosomes, are different in males and females. Females have two "X" chromosomes, and males have one "X" and one "Y" chromosome.  Fragile X is caused by a change in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome that causes it not to work properly. Everyone has 6-10 genes that don't work the way they should, but this generally does not cause a problem. However, the change in the FMR1 gene does make a difference. This change (also called a mutation) in the FMR1 gene is complex and occurs over many generations.  The FMR1 gene contains a section of repetitive DNA that in most of the population is only 10-40 repeats long. In those with fragile X syndrome, this repeated region has expanded to over 200 repeats. When a repeat length is greater than 200, it is referred to as a full mutation or expansion. At this size, the FMR1 gene cannot function and the FMR1 protein cannot be produced. It is the inability of cells to make this protein that is responsible for fragile X syndrome.  In general, every person gets two copies of every gene. This is a little bit different for the FMR1 gene because it is on the "X" chromosome. Because males have only one "X" chromosome, they have only one copy of the FMR1 gene. If they have a full mutation, their one copy of the FMR1 gene is not working, and one sees the signs of fragile X syndrome. Because females have two "X" chromosomes and 2 copies of the FMR1 gene, if a girl inherits a full mutation, the other copy of the gene is usually working, so girls with a full mutation are still able to make FMR1 protein. This is why girls usually have fewer signs of fragile X than boys do.  In general, we expect to see the full mutation in every cell of a person with fragile X syndrome. Sometimes, however, an individual with fragile X syndrome can have what is called mosaicism. There are two kinds of mosaicism in fragile X syndrome: repeat size mosaicism and methylation mosaicism. In repeat size mosaicism, an individual has some cells that have a full mutation and some cells that have a premutation. In methylation mosaicism, all the cells have a full mutation, but the methylation pattern may not be the same in all cells. Some research studies have shown that individuals with repeat size or methylation mosaicism may be less affected than those who do not have mosaicism.   3. What is methylation? Methylation is a process in which a chemical group, called a methyl group, gets added to the DNA. When enough methyl groups are added to the DNA, the gene gets turned off. When methyl groups are removed, the gene gets turned on. This is a normal process and many of our genes are controlled by methylation. However, in fragile X syndrome, the methylation of the FMR1 gene turns the gene off when it should be turned on. When FMR1 is turned off, its protein is not made, and you see the features of fragile X syndrome.  When someone with fragile X syndrome has methylation mosaicism, not all cells will have the FMR1 gene turned off by methylation. Some cells may have it partially turned off, and some cells may have the FMR1 gene turned on.   4. I heard only boys have fragile X syndrome. Why does my daughter have it also? Girls can also have fragile X syndrome even though they have two "X" chromosomes. The reason is that they have a full expansion on one chromosome and a normal repeat section (in most cases) on the other chromosome. The copy with the full expansion is not making any FMR1 protein, while the other copy (the normal repeat section) is making protein. Although some protein is being made, it may not be enough, so we can see characteristics of fragile X syndrome. However, because some protein is being made, girls with fragile X syndrome are generally less affected than boys.   5. Is there a cure? At this time, there is no cure for fragile X syndrome. Treatment for fragile X syndrome is provided through therapies such as special education, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy. Medications may be helpful in managing hyperactivity, short attention span, and other behavioral or emotional problems. In order to determine the best course of action for your child, a comprehensive evaluation is recommended.  Family Members and Family Planning   6. Could my brothers and sisters have children with fragile X syndrome? For moms, yes, your siblings and also your cousins are at risk for having children with fragile X syndrome. For dads, it is possible but unlikely. Why is this the case? To begin with, the repetitive region in the FMR1 gene expands through generations. There is an intermediate expansion, called the fragile X premutation, that is about 60-200 repeats in length. Individuals with a repeat length of this size are called premutation carriers and do not have symptoms associated with fragile X syndrome. However, the premutation is unstable and can expand to the full mutation in future generations. For reasons that are not well understood, expansion typically only occurs when the premutation is inherited from the mother.  When a couple has a child with fragile X syndrome, we know that the mother is a premutation carrier as the premutation typically only expands to the full mutation when inherited from the mother. Because mom inherited the premutation from one of her parents, her siblings and cousins are also at risk for being premutation carriers and having children with fragile X syndrome. Testing mom's parents to determine who she inherited the premutation from can tell us which side of her family is at risk for having children with fragile X syndrome.  With dads, it's a little trickier. Dads can have either the normal repeat length (10-40 repeats) or be premutation carriers themselves. The only way to determine this is through DNA testing. In general, testing is not performed unless there is a history of fragile X in his family. If testing is performed and dad is found to be a premutation carrier, his siblings and cousins are at risk for having children with fragile X syndrome.   7. If I am a premutation carrier, am I at risk for anything? Unlike many genetic disorders, being a carrier does put you at an increased risk for certain medical problems.  Females who are premutation carriers are at risk for premature menopause, or loss of menses before the age of 40. Premature menopause occurs at a rate of approximately 6% of females in the general population. With female fragile X premutation carriers, this rate increases to about 20%. Even when occurring after age 40, the age of onset for menopause on average can occur 6-8 years earlier in women who are fragile X premutation carriers. This can be a serious concern if you are in your 30s and are planning to have another child. If you are currently trying to have a child and are having infertility problems, premature menopause could be a cause. In addition, some of the options for reducing your risk of having another child with fragile X syndrome, such as IVF with PGD, may be a less viable option due to premature menopause. If you are a premutation carrier, you should discuss this risk with your primary care physician and OB/GYN, especially if you are planning on having more children.  Males who are premutation carriers are at risk for a condition known as fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS is characterized by progressively severe intention tremor and difficulty with walking and balance. It can also be associated with dementia characterized by memory loss, trouble formulating plans, difficulty with focusing attention, and difficulty knowing what's appropriate or not. Other neurological findings may also be present. FXTAS appears to affect primarily older premutation carrier males with signs appearing in their 50s to 60s. Recent research has also shown that some premutation carrier females may also develop FXTAS, but not as often as premutation carrier males.   8. I want more children. Is there any way to tell whether I will have another child with fragile X syndrome? By having a child with fragile X syndrome, you are at an increased risk of having a 2nd child with the condition. However, prenatal diagnosis is available. Either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10-12 weeks gestation or amniocentesis at 14-18 weeks gestation can be performed. With CVS, there is a preliminary result available in the first trimester although the confirmatory testing for a final result is often not available until the second trimester. In addition, certain results from CVS analysis can sometimes be difficult to interpret. For further details about why these issues can occur, talk to your genetic counselor. With amniocentesis, results are generally available approximately 4 weeks after the procedure is performed. Even with diagnosis of a full mutation in either a male or female, it is not possible to determine what difficulties he or she may have.  Other risk reducing options are available, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), IVF with egg donor, and adoption. As with CVS, results from PGD can sometimes be difficult to interpret and may require confirmatory testing. The decision to follow through with one of these options is a very personal one, and what may be right for one couple is not right for another. There is no right answer. These options can be further discussed with your doctor or genetic counselor.   Potential Medical Problems    9. My child has/had feeding problems. Is this going to be a lifelong problem? Usually, feeding problems and vomiting improve with age. If feeding problems are severe, a study called an esophageal pH probe study may be done to look for reflux. A barium swallow study may be performed to assess reflux treatment. Treatment for reflux generally involves thickening feedings and placing your child in an upright position after meals. Medication may also be needed.   10. I've heard that children and adults with fragile X syndrome may have significant behavior issues. What can be done to manage behaviors? It's true that many individuals with fragile X syndrome have behavior issues. Hyperactivity is common in childhood, but does tend to improve in adolescence and adulthood. Social anxiety is also common, and may be particularly severe in females with fragile X syndrome. Anxiety may lead to outbursts of aggression, particularly in males. Another concern of parents is their child's obsessive and compulsive behavior. This may manifest itself in repetitive behavior.  Usually, medications can be used to treat these behaviors. This combined with other treatment modalities, including counseling and sensory integration therapy, can be very helpful for those who have significant behavior problems. In addition, treatments specific for behaviors can be helpful. For example, limiting excessive sensory stimulation whenever possible may prevent aggressive outbursts and social anxiety. Working with a psychologist can help children who have tantrums, oppositional behavior, or severe hyperactivity.   11. My child suffers from seizures. Is this common in fragile X syndrome? Seizures occur in approximately 20% of individuals with fragile X syndrome and usually present early in childhood. The types of seizures generally seen in individuals with fragile X syndrome generally respond well to anti-seizure medication. The seizures tend to resolve by adolescence, but may continue into adulthood.  If you believe your child is having seizures, an appointment with a neurologist should be scheduled as soon as possible. The neurologist may perform an EEG to determine what kind of seizures your child is having and will discuss a treatment plan with you.   12. My child has been referred to an ophthalmologist, but he doesn't seem to have any vision problems. In about 25-55% of individuals with fragile X syndrome have eye problems, including strabismus (the inability to focus both eyes on an object because of muscle weakness in one eye), hyperopia (far-sightedness), and astigmatism. Corrective lenses are generally used to treat far-sightedness and astigmatism. Treatment for strabismus often involves patching, eye exercises, or lenses to strengthen the weak eye. If none of these work, surgery may be required.   13. I finally got my daughter potty trained, but she is still wetting herself at night. She gets upset when she wakes up. What can I do? This along with delays in potty training are frequent problems in children with fragile X syndrome. Some behavioral tactics, such as decreasing fluids after dinner, going to the bathroom before bedtime, and waking your child to go to the bathroom when you go to bed, may help to decrease the frequency of bed-wetting. Your doctor may also be able to prescribe medications that help.   14. I read that people with fragile X syndrome have connective tissue problems. What does this mean? Connective tissue connects and supports other tissues and includes cartilage, blood, and bone. We're not entirely sure why individuals with fragile X syndrome have connective tissue problems. Many of these problems are minor, such as loose, flexible (or hyperextensible) joints. Flat feet are also common in children with fragile X syndrome. Joint hyperextensibility tends to improve with age. Most of the time, having loose, flexible joints does not cause a problem and requires no treatment. Occasionally, however, a joint may be dislocated and will require treatment.   15. My son with fragile X syndrome is 12 years old. Some of the boys his age at school are starting to go through puberty. Will he go through puberty normally? Your son should go through puberty normally. One thing to be aware of is that in 80-90% of males with fragile X syndrome have what is called macroorchidism, or large testicles. This generally does not cause any complications and does not require any intervention. However, because males with fragile X may have connective tissue problems, having large testicles may predispose them to inguinal hernias. Inguinal hernias can occur during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.   16. My daughter appears to be starting puberty. What should I expect? As with boys, girls seem to go through puberty normally. It is important to address your daughter's emotional status before and during her period as girls with fragile X syndrome are prone to mood swings and anxiety, particularly during times of hormonal change (such as puberty and her period).  There have been a number of reports about girls having precocious puberty. Girls who present with features of precocious puberty should see an endocrinologist who may use hormone treatment to stop the progression.   17. Will my child be able to have children? Yes. Both males and females with fragile X syndrome are fertile. Girls with fragile X syndrome are at risk for having children who also have fragile X syndrome. Boys with fragile X syndrome are premutation carriers, even though they themselves have the full mutation. Therefore, all of their daughters will be premutation carriers.   18. Our oldest son was recently diagnosed with fragile X syndrome. At the time, the doctor said something could be wrong with his heart. Is this something serious? About 50% of adults with fragile X syndrome, including females, have something called mitral valve prolapse (MVP). This means that one of the heart valves, the mitral valve, is leaky. If MVP is severe or associated with mitral regurgitation (meaning the blood goes back to the chamber where it came from), prophylactic antibiotics for surgical or dental procedures may be recommended.  In addition to MVP, many adults with fragile X syndrome have high blood pressure. This can be treated using blood pressure medications.   19. I'm only 38 years old and I'm already starting menopause. My gynecologist says it may be because I'm a fragile X premutation carrier. Is she right? It is true that being a premutation carrier puts you at higher risk for premature menopause. Approximately 20% of females who are fragile X premutation carriers experience premature menopause (loss of menses before age 40), as opposed to 6% in the general population. Interestingly enough, full mutation carriers (or girls with fragile X syndrome) are not at a higher risk for fragile X syndrome. Even when occurring after age 40, the age of onset for menopause in premutation carriers can occur 6-8 years earlier than in women in the general population.   20. My father is starting to develop a tremor which the doctors think could be Parkinson's disease. I read somewhere that male fragile X premutation carriers are at risk for neurological problems. Is Parkinson's one of them? Older males who are fragile X premutation carriers are indeed at risk for a combination of neurological problems called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS is characterized by progressively severe intention tremor and difficulty with walking and balance. It can also be associated with dementia characterized by memory loss, trouble formulating plans, difficulty with focusing attention, and difficulty knowing what's appropriate or not. Signs of FXTAS start appearing when male premutation carriers are in their 50s and 60s. About 75% of premutation carrier men will show signs of FXTAS by their 80s.

Genes determine many things about the person. For example, what the person will look like and whether he or she is likely to have certain illnesses. In addition, genes have instructions for making proteins in the cells. Proteins are needed for the body to work correctly.  FXS is caused by a change in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The FMR1 gene makes a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that is needed for normal brain development.  Chromosomes  Genes are found on chromosomes. Every human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. People get their chromosomes from their parents. People get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from their father. The chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They decide if a person is male or female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).  The FMR1 gene is on the X chromosome.  DNA  The chromosomes and genes have a special code called DNA. DNA has four chemical letters, called “bases”: A, C, T, and G. The order of the letters determines the information carried in each gene, like the way that a specific pattern of letters makes up the words in a sentence.  How FXS is Inherited  There is a place in the FMR1 gene where the DNA pattern CGG is repeated over and over again. In most people, the number of repeats is small (5 to 44 repeats), which is normal. If the number of repeats is too large (more than 200 repeats), the gene turns off. When the gene is turned off, no protein is made. Without the protein, the person develops FXS. This is called a “trinucleotide repeat disorder.” People get (inherit) the disorder from their parents.

Normal: 5 to 44 Repeats  Most people have about 5 to 44 repeats of the letters CGG in their FMR1 genes. This is considered a normal number of repeats. People with a normal number of repeats do not have FXS and are not at risk for having children with FXS.  Intermediate: 45 to 54 Repeats  People who have an intermediate number of repeats (about 45 to 54) do not have FXS. However, they may have a slightly higher chance of having some symptoms.  Premutation: 55 to 200 Repeats  People who have a premutation (about 55 to 200 repeats) do not have FXS. However, they might have another fragile X-associated disorder and related concerns . In addition, people with a premutation can have children with a premutation or full mutation (FXS).   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing the premutation or full mutation on to their child (daughters or sons). The more CGG repeats the mother has, the more likely her child will have full mutation fragile X.  Men will have daughters with a premutation, but sons will not be affected.   Full Mutation (FXS): More than 200 Repeats  People with a full mutation (more than 200 repeats) have FXS.   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing fragile X on to their child (sons or daughters).

What is Fragile X syndrome?  The term Fragile X refers to a group of conditions due to defects in a gene on the X chromosome:   Fragile X syndrome (FXS)  Fragile X-associated Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS)  Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI)   Fragile X syndrome (FXS), first known as Martin-Bell syndrome, is the most common inherited form of mental impairment. FXS affects 1 in 4,000 boys and 1 in 6,000 girls of all races and ethnic groups. While Fragile X individuals have a normal life expectancy, most will need support and care for their entire lives. A single gene in the brain cells shuts down, causing Fragile X syndrome. In 1991, scientists discovered the defect in a gene on the X chromosome (called FMR1) that causes FXS. In affected individuals, this gene is shut down and cannot manufacture the protein it normally makes – a protein vital for normal brain development and functioning. Large-scale population studies of Fragile X still need to be done, but it is clear that this is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans. Most people with Fragile X are not yet correctly diagnosed. Research is aimed at developing effective treatments. In addition, this research is leading to better understanding and treatments for other conditions, such as autism, and Alzheimer’s Disease.

There have been a number of studies aimed at determining the prevalence of FXS in males and females. Studies have been undertaken both in the “special needs” population and the general population. The agreed upon prevalence of FXS in males is approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 and in females is approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000.  The reason it is lower in females is that, while all males with an FMR1 full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome, some females with an FMR1 full mutation will not have behavioral, cognitive or physical features of FXS.   How Many Individuals are Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation?  According to a 2012 study by the CDC , the frequency of Fragile X premutation is as follows:  1 in 151 females, or about 1 million women in the United States.  1 in 468 males, or about 320,000 men in the United States.  These statistics are important because both men and women are at risk for having symptoms linked to Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Women with a premutation reported their last menstrual cycle at an earlier age than women without a premutation (48 vs. 51 years).  Men and women with a premutation were more than four times as likely to report dizziness or fainting as people without a premutation (18% vs. 4%). Men and women with a premutation were more than twice as likely to report numbness as people without a premutation (29% vs. 13%).  This study of 6,747 older adults in Wisconsin found 30 people with a change in the FMR1 gene. Based on this relatively small number of people, the results should be interpreted with caution. These findings may not reflect all people in the United States with an FMR1 premutation For example a large Israeli study found approximately 1/130 women were FMR1 carriers.   Prevalence of FXTAS  Current estimates suggest that about 30-40% of male FMR1 premutation carriers over 50 years of age, within families already known to have someone with Fragile X, will ultimately exhibit some features of FXTAS.  This figure may be as low as 10-20% in the general population, since the majority of carriers have a premutation in the lower range of CGG repeats, where the occurrence of FXTAS appears to be reduced.  Though there are specific diagnostic criteria for FXTAS , some men may only exhibit some of the symptoms, and may not develop all of the cardinal features of the condition.  For men who are premutation carriers, the chance of developing core symptoms of FXTAS (tremor, problems with walking/balance) increases with age.  From age 50-59 the chance is about 17%.  From age 60-69 about 38%.  From age 70-79 about 47%.  Over 80 years old, about 75% will develop symptoms of FXTAS.  Studies of females have found that about 8-16% of premutation carriers, within families already known to have someone with a Fragile X condition, develop some FXTAS symptoms. The symptoms in females tend to be milder.  FXTAS may be one of the most common adult onset, single-gene neurological diseases; similar in prevalence to other neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease); however more studies within the general population will be necessary before the true incidence is known.   Prevalence of FXPOI  Approximately 20-25% of women with an FMR1 premutation will develop FXPOI . FXPOI covers a range of ovarian difficulties including early menopause, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, sub fertility and premature ovarian failure (cessation of menstrual periods prior to age 40)   How Common are Intermediate (Grey Area) Alleles?  Approximately 1 in 50 (2%) of individuals have an intermediate allele . There appear to be no clinical associations with intermediate alleles. Most intermediate alleles are stable and do not change over generations. In a small number of families intermediate alleles show some slight instability and can lead to a premutation in future generations. Individuals with an intermediate allele are not at risk for any for the FXDs or to have children with Fragile X syndrome.  Based on the best available evidence:  Approximately 1 million Americans carry the Fragile X mutation, including approximately 100,000 with Fragile X syndrome, and are at risk for developing a Fragile X-associated Disorder.  Approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: The vast majority of males with the full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: Approximately 50% of females with the full mutation will have some features of Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 468 men in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.  Approximately 1 in 151 women in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.       male chromosomes   Female Chromosomes     Genetics and Inheritance        What Are Chromosomes?  Our bodies are made up of about 60 trillion cells. Each one of those cells manufactures proteins. The kinds of proteins any given cell makes determine its particular characteristics, which in turn create the characteristics of the entire body.  The instructions for making these proteins are stored in chemicals or molecules called DNA, which is organized into chromosomes. Chromosomes are found in the center, or nucleus, of all of our cells, including the eggs and sperm.  Chromosomes are passed down from generation to generation through the egg and sperm. Typically, we all have 46 chromosomes in our cells, two of which are sex chromosomes. In females, these are two Xs; in males they are an X and a Y.    The Role of Genes?  Genes are sections of DNA that are passed from generation to generation and perform one function. If we think of DNA as letters in the alphabet, the genes are words and the chromosome is a full sentence. All 46 chromosomes then make up the whole book.  There are many genes on each chromosome; we all have tens of thousands of genes that instruct our bodies on how to develop.  Genes are given names to identify them and the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome is called FMR1. The FMR1 Gene is on the X chromosome.    How Do Changes in the FMR1 Gene Lead to FXS?  The FMR1 gene appears in four forms that are defined by the number of repeats of a pattern of DNA called CGG repeats.  Individuals with less than 45 CGG repeats have a normal FMR1 gene. Those with 45-54 CGG repeats have what is called an “intermediate” or “grey zone allele,” which does not cause any of the known Fragile X associated disorders.  Individuals with 55-200 CGG repeats have a “premutation,” which means they carry an unstable mutation of the gene that can expand in future generations and thus cause Fragile X syndrome in their children or grandchildren. Individuals with a premutation can also develop FXTAS or FXPOI themselves.  Individuals with over 200 CGG repeats have a full mutation of the FMR1 gene, which causes Fragile X syndrome.  The full mutation causes the FMR1 gene to shut down or “methylate” in one region. Normally, the FMR1 gene produces an important protein called FMRP. When the gene is turned off, the individual does not make this protein. The lack of this specific protein is what causes Fragile X syndrome.    The Fragile X Premutation  Fragile X-associated Disorders are a group of conditions called trinucleotide repeat disorders. A common feature of these conditions is that the gene can change sizes over generations, becoming more unstable, and thus the conditions may occur more frequently or severely in subsequent generations. These conditions are often caused by a gene change that begins with a premutation and then expands to a full mutation in subsequent generations.  Approximately 1 in 151 females and 1 in 468 males carry the FMR1 premutation. They are thus “carriers” of the premutation.  Premutations are defined as having 55-200 CGG repeats and can occur in both males and females. When a father passes the premutation on to his daughters, it usually does not expand to a full mutation. A man never passes the Fragile X gene to his sons, since he passes only his Y chromosome to them, which does not contain a Fragile X gene.  A female with the FMR1 premutation will often pass on a larger version of the mutation to her children (more on this point below). She also has a 50 percent chance of passing on her normal X chromosome in each pregnancy, since usually only one of her X chromosomes has the FMR1 mutation.  The chance of the premutation expanding to a full mutation is related to the size of the mother’s premutation. The larger the mother’s CGG repeat number, the higher the chance that it will expand to a full mutation if it is passed on.  Typically, the premutation has no immediate and observable impact on a person’s appearance or health. However, some females with a premutation will experience Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) , which causes infertility, irregular or missed menstrual cycles, and/or early menopause.  Additionally, some older adults with a premutation may develop a neurological condition called FXTAS , (Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder.  FXTAS and FXPOI are part of the family of conditions called Fragile X-associated Disorders.    The FMR1 Full Mutation  A full mutation is defined as having over 200 CGG repeats and causes that indicate the presence of Fragile X syndrome in males and some females. Most full mutation expansions have some degree of Methylation (the process which “turns off” the gene). Males with a full mutation will have Fragile X Syndrome , though with varying degrees of severity  About 65-70 percent of females with a full mutation exhibit some difficulties with cognitive, learning, behavioral, or social functioning, and may also have some of the physical features of FXS (such as large ears or a long face). The remaining 30-35 percent are at risk to develop mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, or they may have no observable effects of the full mutation.    Inheritance  Fragile X in an “X-linked” condition, which means that the gene is on the X chromosome.  Since a woman has two X chromosomes a woman with a premutation or full mutation has a 50% chance of passing on the X with the mutation in each pregnancy, and a 50% chance of passing on her normal X.  If she has a premutation, and it is passed on (to either males or females), it can remain a premutation or it can expand to a full mutation. If she has a full mutation and it is passed on (to either males or females), it will remain a full mutation.  Because males have only one X chromosome, fathers who carry the premutation will pass it on to all their daughters and none of their sons (they pass their Y chromosome on to their sons). There have been no reports of premutations that are passed from a father to his daughter expanding to a full mutation. This appears to only occur when passed from a mother to her children.    Unique Features of Fragile X Inheritance  In many X-linked conditions only males who inherit the abnormal gene are affected. Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked conditions that can also affect females.  Additionally, in other X-linked conditions all males who carry the abnormal form of the gene are affected. In Fragile X syndrome, unaffected males can carry the gene in the premutation form while themselves having no symptoms of the condition.        FMR1 Gene    What Is a Gene?  A gene is a unit of heredity that is passed down from parent to child. Genes are located on chromosomes that are in all of our cells, including the sperm and egg that make a baby.   What Is a Gene Made Of?  Genes are made of molecules or chemicals called DNA. The pattern of DNA will determine if the gene is working properly. The DNA has to be in a certain pattern or order, like the numbers in a phone number.   How Does a Gene Work?  A gene has different parts that work together like a factory or machine. It has a “promoter” that turns the gene on, like a light switch. It has sections that are just “filler” and act as place holders, called “introns.” The sections that are used to make a protein or do a job are called “exons.”   What Do Genes Do?  The job of a gene is to either make a protein, the building blocks of all the structures in the body, or to regulate other proteins in the body.   How Does a Gene Make Proteins?  The DNA in the gene is a code that is “transcribed” or “talks” to another kind of molecule called RNA. This is like one side of Velcro sticking to another that it matches up to. The RNA then “translates” the DNA to put together the protein.     Now that you understand what genes are, let’s discuss the Fragile X gene…   The Fragile X ( FMR1 ) Gene   Why Is It Called the FMR1 Gene?  Genes are named when they are discovered. Often the name isn’t exactly the same as the condition, in case it is later discovered that there is more than one gene involved in the condition. The gene that causes Fragile X is called the “ FMR1 gene,” which stands for Fragile X mental retardation gene. Though the term “mental retardation” has given way in recent years to the more generally accepted term of “intellectual disabilities,” the scientific name of the gene can’t change with the times.    Ideogram of X chromosome    Where Is the FMR1 Gene Located?  The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome. We all have 46 chromosomes in all of our cells, 44 of which are numbered 1-22 in pairs. Then females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Each chromosome has two arms, one called the “p” arm (the short arm) and one called the “q” arm (the long arm).  There are many genes on each chromosome, like houses on a street. Each gene is given an address, depending on where it lies on the chromosome. The address of the FMR1 gene is Xq27.3   Does Everyone Have an FMR1 Gene?  Yes, everyone has an FMR1 gene. When someone states, “I have the gene for Fragile X,” they really mean they have a gene mutation for Fragile X. Some Fragile X genes are normal and some are not.   What Does the FMR1 Gene Do?  The FMR1 gene makes a very important protein called FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein). Though this protein is found in all our cells, it is most abundant in the nerve cells, and particularly in a part of the nerve cell that “talks” to other nerve cells called “dendrites.”    What Is an FMR1 Gene Mutation?  A mutation is any change in a gene. Some mutations don’t cause any problems and we don’t know about them (unless found in the laboratory). Mutations in the FMR1 gene involve an abnormal expansion of the DNA in the “promoter” area of the gene. Often a mutation causes decreased or absent protein production. In individuals with a “ full mutation ,” their FMR1 gene is shut down and they don’t make enough or any FMRP.   Are There Different Kinds of FMR1 Mutations?  Yes. An individual can have a normal FMR1 gene, a “ premutation ” or a “ full mutation .” There is also another category called an “intermediate allele,” which is not a true mutation, but an expansion somewhere between the “normal” FMR1 gene and the premutation.   What Is the Difference Between These Mutations?    FMR1 Gene Categories   The mutation of the FMR1 gene involves a repeating pattern of DNA called a “CGG repeat.” DNA is made of molecules that are abbreviated A, C, G and T. A CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene is a pattern of DNA that may repeats itself anywhere from 30 to 1000 times. In the FMR1 gene there is an area of the promoter that is rich in these CGG repeats and is measured when Fragile X testing is performed.  In this area, there is normally about 30 repeats of CGG. In individuals with the premutation, there are from 55-200 of these repeats. Persons with the full mutation have more than 200 of the CGG repeats. When there is more than 200 CGG repeats, the gene is turned off by a process called Methylation .  Methylation happens to other genes too, when they are supposed to be turned off (as in the genes we don’t use, like those that make a tail grow!). In Fragile X the methylation turns off the FMR1 gene, so no FMRP is produced. This is what causes Fragile X Syndrome .   FMRP – The Fragile X Protein   Each cell works somewhat like a factory. The external membrane functions as the exterior walls of the factory. The nucleus stores the genetic blueprints in the form of DNA. The machinery (ribosomes) for assembling the products (proteins) is attached to the shop floor (endoplasmic reticulum). The Golgi concentrates the proteins to export them. The lysosome is used for waste disposal and recycling.   What Do Proteins Do?    Used with permission of Paul Thiessen Chemical Graphics   The body makes about 50,000 different kinds of protein. These proteins serve in two major roles. Some of them make up part of the structure of our bodies. Others are enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that works like a tool. It helps a particular chemical reaction take place.  For example, there is a particular enzyme that breaks apart starch into sugar molecules; you use it in your small intestine to digest your carbohydrates. Another enzyme takes a sugar molecule and adds a phosphate onto it to make it unstable. Then a series of about 20 more enzymes each process the unstable sugar molecule in a disassembly line that pulls the sugar molecule apart and releases energy.  Proteins are made out of 20 different amino acids like leucine, lysine, tryptophan, etc. When you eat foods that contain proteins, the first thing your digestive system does is to break them down into amino acids. Then you assemble those amino acids into your own proteins. In a way, it is like words. You can make all kinds of words out of 26 letters. You could take a magazine, cut apart all of the letters and reassemble them into your own words. The proteins you make are assembled out of the parts from the proteins you digested from your food.  Fragile X syndrome is caused because people with the disease don’t make a particular protein, FMRP. Sometimes someone asks why we can’t just feed a person with Fragile X more protein. The problem is not lack of protein; a bunch of proteins won’t help someone who is missing FMRP. It is a specific protein that is missing, not proteins in general.  To understand this, think about someone who is trying to say the word “frozen”. Handing the person a list of names from the phone book won’t help. In the same way, having someone eat a bunch of proteins won’t give the person the specific protein that is needed.  Even if we injected that person with lots of FMRP, it would not help. FMRP needs to be present in the right cells at the right time in the right amount.  We are just beginning to learn which cells normally make FMRP. We have some clues about what the function of FMRP is but we have much to learn.    Used with Permission of Dennis Kunkel’s Image Gallery   The synthesis of a protein such as FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein) begins in the nucleus of the cell when the DNA receives a request for that specific information. It is a bit like someone going to a library and selecting a particular book. In response to the request, the DNA opens up and a copy of the coded information is transcribed, much like someone photocopies a chapter of a book in a library. That copy of the DNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA).  The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes out to the main part of the cell, the cytoplasm. There the coded mRNA is translated on ribosomes with the help of transfer RNA and a protein is assembled out of amino acids.  The protein takes on a particular shape that allows it to perform very specific tasks. While we know the tasks of some of the proteins that humans make, we only have hints about the role of FMRP.   Methylation     Used with permission of New England Biolabs   One of the ways the cells control which genetic information they will use is to chemically modify the DNA. The illustration on the left shows an enzyme (diagrammed in ribbons) adding methyl groups to some of the DNA (balls in the form of a double helix). This inactivates that part of the chromosome. It’s as if we were to put glue on the edges of some of the books in the library; those pages would become unavailable to readers.   Good methylation  In females methylation is used regularly to solve a problem. Men have only one X chromosome and women have two. As a result, female cells might be expected to make twice as much protein from the information on X chromosomes as males do. Instead, women’s cells randomly pick one of the X chromosomes and turn it off by methylation. Thus both males and females have one working X chromosome in each cell and as a result, one working unit of all the genetic information on the X chromosome.   Bad methylation  As noted above, methylation is generally a useful method for turning off chromosomal information. However, in Fragile X syndrome, methylation is involved in causing the disease. Near the FMR1 Gene is a regulatory site called a CpG island. In most people, the site is not methylated. As a result, the cell can use the FMR1 gene when there is a need for FMRP – The Fragile X Protein .  In people with Fragile X syndrome, the CpG island is methylated. As a result, the cell is unable to copy the information in the FMR1 gene. Since an mRNA copy is not made, FMRP will not be synthesized. Since there is no FMRP at the time and place it is needed, the characteristics of Fragile X syndrome are set in motion.   It’s not really the CGG’s  Much of the focus on Fragile X syndrome is on the expansion of the repeated CGG’s . It is technically not the expansion that directly causes the problem. Instead, having more than 230 CGG repeats sets in motion methylation of part of the FMR1 gene. The methylation stops the synthesis of FMRP and the absence of FMRP causes Fragile X syndrome. We do not know why having too many CGG repeats triggers methylation.  In theory, if the methylation could be removed from that spot on the FMR1 gene, it could allow access to the FMR1 gene and allow its FMRP product to be assembled. This is one of the potential treatment areas that researchers are investigating.   Mosaic females  The inactivation of female X chromosomes by methylation mentioned above, also seems to partially determine the impact of a full Fragile X mutation on females. Each cell in a female will inactivate or turn off one of its two X chromosomes.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the Fragile X mutation, then most of the cells will have an active X chromosome that can produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be limited.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the working FMR1, then there will be few cells able to produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be more pronounced.  So the severity of Fragile X syndrome on a female depends in part on whether her cells turn off mainly X chromosomes with a good FMR1 or mainly X chromosomes with a defective FMR1.   What Is Genetic Counseling?       What Does a Genetic Counselor Do?  A genetic counselor is a trained master’s level medical professional who works with individuals and families to:  Review genetic testing and diagnoses.  Review inheritance patterns.  Help identify possible carriers in the family.  Discuss the symptoms and features of Fragile X-associated Disorders.  When appropriate, review reproductive issues and options.  Make referrals and provide professional and emotional support.  Due to the complexity of Fragile X testing, the counselor is essential in the interpretation of results and for providing accurate information regarding Fragile X.   Where Do Genetic Counselors Work?  Genetic counselors can work either independently or are part of a medical team.  Some common settings where genetic counselors work are:  Medical genetics departments in a hospital/medical center setting.  Prenatal, perinatal or infertility care providers.  Specialist medical groups such as oncology, hematology, neurology, cardiology.  Multidisciplinary clinics such as craniofacial, skeletal dysplasia, Fragile X clinics.  Private practice.  Public and community health settings.  Genetics laboratories.  Support organizations (such as the NFXF).   Who Should Meet With a Genetic Counselor?  Anyone who:  Has been identified as being a “Fragile X carrier” or has positive, inconclusive or, in any way unusual Fragile X testing results.  Has a family member who has been identified as being a carrier of a Fragile X mutation.  Has a child or family member diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome or any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Has a family or personal  history of undiagnosed intellectual disabilities, autism or learning disorders.  Has symptoms of any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders, including infertility, early menopause and/or adult onset neurological or movement disorders.   What Will Likely Occur in a Genetic Counseling Session?  The counselor:  Will ask questions regarding the  medical or developmental/learning history of your family members (including children, parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, grandparents).  Will review the genetic implications of the diagnosis or test results.  May identify other family members who may have inherited the gene mutation.  May make suggestions or assist with informing or contacting family members regarding testing.  May meet with you either independently or in conjunction with a medical geneticist or other provider, who will likely examine your child or affected family member. If the counseling will be focused on carrier testing, an exam is often not indicated.  Can work with you and other family members to coordinate testing throughout the family.  Can provide information and help with decision-making regarding reproductive issues and options and coordinate/arrange any further testing.  Can make referrals to other providers for medical evaluations and care, prenatal care and  testing, therapies for your child, family counseling, or whatever needs you have at the time.   How Do You Find a Genetic Counselor in Your Area?  Ask your doctor or provider for a referral to a local genetic counselor.

I Was Just Figuring Out CGG Repeats! Most of us have heard of CGG repeats, those patterns of DNA molecules that are counted when testing for Fragile X (FMR1) mutations. (For background, see the Q & A with Dr. Karen Usdin on page 16.) We then hear a number like 400 for full mutations or 80 for premutations and that’s it, nothing else matters but that magic number. We envision a long tract of CGGCGGCGGCGG over and over again, as the genetic counselor or doctor described. But lately you may also have begun hearing about “AGG interruptions,” which in some way are related to Fragile X inheritance. This article will offer an overview of their importance.   To review some genetics, DNA is a strand of chemicals, called nucleotides. The nucleotides that make up DNA are Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine (abbreviated as A, T, C and G). So a CGG repeat is a triplet of cytosine, guanine and guanine. The pattern of nucleotides (like ATCGATCG, etc.) makes up a gene that instructs the cell on how to make or regulate proteins.  In the 1990s, after the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the CGG repeat expansion that causes Fragile X syndrome, Fragile X experts began talking about a different DNA pattern called an “AGG interruption,” which occurs between about every nine or 10 CGGs. In the normal Fragile X gene (five to 45 repeats), you might have a 30-CGG-repeat pattern that has 10 CGGs, one AGG, then 10 CGGs, then one AGG, then another 10 CGGs. These AGG interruptions act as a sort of anchor, keeping the 30-repeat FMR1 gene stable, like fence posts every 10 feet in a long fence.  As DNA samples were being studied by Fragile X researchers, they found that while some individuals had AGG interruptions every nine or 10 CGG repeats, some lost them as the repeats got bigger. So a person might have 10 CGGs then one AGG, 10 CGGs then one AGG, then 40 CGGs in an individual who has 60 CGG repeats.  This led to two questions regarding the presence or pattern of AGG interruptions: 1) Do the number or placement of AGG interruptions affect the stability of the FMR1 gene? 2) “Why do some premutations expand and some not?”  A recent study by Dr. Sarah Nolin at Institute of Basic Research in New York, Dr. Elizabeth Berry-Kravis at Rush Medical Center in Chicago and Asuragen Inc. in Austin, Texas was presented in a poster at the annual meeting of the American College on Medical Genetics earlier this year. The purpose of the study was to see how AGG interruptions affect the stability of the premutation, and also to develop (and use) the technology that would identify these AGG interruptions in Fragile X testing.  The study found that if there were 33 or fewer CGGs in a row beyond the last AGG, then the premutation usually didn’t expand. But when there were 39 or more CGGs in a row after the last AGG, without any AGG interruptions, then the premutation was usually unstable (expanding by one or more CGG repeats). This helps us understand why some premutations with, for example, 62 CGG repeats, appear stable over generations, whereas some with the same number of 62 repeats expand over subsequent generations. It’s because the one with a long tract (>39 repeats) of CGG repeats without an AGG “anchor” is more likely to expand than one with properly interspersed AGG interruptions.  The technology that was developed to identify the presence and placement of the AGG interruptions is new and exciting. Asuragen, in cooperation with the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute, has developed a unique type of PC test (see below) called “Amplidex.” It can identify the AGG interruptions in both males and females and in both normal and expanded FMR1 genes.  For scientific reasons, labs have had a hard time finding AGG interruptions, especially in women. This new technology overcomes these hurdles. Variations on a genetic testing method called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, reveal the number and location of AGG interruptions. Three different PCR studies done together show very different patterns of the CGG repeat region when AGG interruptions are present. Specially trained experts in a laboratory can review all three studies to solve the problem of where the AGG interruptions are located; the method is similar to solving a brainteaser puzzle.  This test is currently available only for research studies. Eventually it may be available for clinical use. So it is possible that in addition to the “magic number” of CGG repeats, the presence and placement of AGG interruptions will inform your risk for expansion of a premutation.  Why it Matters  There are a number of reasons why this issue of AGG interruptions is important.  First, if you or a family member have a premutation that hasn’t expanded to a full mutation, this technology may give you more accurate risk figures for that premutation to expand.  Second, it is possible that the number of AGG interruptions may contribute to or affect the risk for FXPOI or FXTAS. The risk for FXPOI is about 20–25 percent in female premutation carriers; the risk for FXTAS is about 30–40 percent in male and 5–8 percent in female carriers. At this point we don’t have good “predictors” of who may develop these two conditions. It is possible that this technology identifying AGG interruptions may lead us to better predict the group at highest (and lowest) risk for these Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Third, it is possible that our knowledge of AGG interruptions might lead to better understanding of the small subset of children with premutations who have developmental disorders like autism, ADHD, etc. We know this is clearly a small group, since most premutation carriers exhibit normal development and cognitive function. However, there is a small subset of (mostly male) children in the premutation range who have developmental/behavioral disorders, and this new technology might give us some clues as to why they are affected, even though most carriers are not.  All of which leads to the possibility that you may soon hear, “I have 65 repeats with three AGG interruptions, ya-hoo!”       Copyright 2017 National Fragile X Foundation 1861 International Drive Suite 200, McLean, VA  22102, (800) 688-8765 Powered by PRI .

There have been a number of studies aimed at determining the prevalence of FXS in males and females. Studies have been undertaken both in the “special needs” population and the general population. The agreed upon prevalence of FXS in males is approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 and in females is approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000.  The reason it is lower in females is that, while all males with an FMR1 full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome, some females with an FMR1 full mutation will not have behavioral, cognitive or physical features of FXS.   How Many Individuals are Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation?  According to a 2012 study by the CDC , the frequency of Fragile X premutation is as follows:  1 in 151 females, or about 1 million women in the United States.  1 in 468 males, or about 320,000 men in the United States.  These statistics are important because both men and women are at risk for having symptoms linked to Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Women with a premutation reported their last menstrual cycle at an earlier age than women without a premutation (48 vs. 51 years).  Men and women with a premutation were more than four times as likely to report dizziness or fainting as people without a premutation (18% vs. 4%). Men and women with a premutation were more than twice as likely to report numbness as people without a premutation (29% vs. 13%).  This study of 6,747 older adults in Wisconsin found 30 people with a change in the FMR1 gene. Based on this relatively small number of people, the results should be interpreted with caution. These findings may not reflect all people in the United States with an FMR1 premutation For example a large Israeli study found approximately 1/130 women were FMR1 carriers.   Prevalence of FXTAS  Current estimates suggest that about 30-40% of male FMR1 premutation carriers over 50 years of age, within families already known to have someone with Fragile X, will ultimately exhibit some features of FXTAS.  This figure may be as low as 10-20% in the general population, since the majority of carriers have a premutation in the lower range of CGG repeats, where the occurrence of FXTAS appears to be reduced.  Though there are specific diagnostic criteria for FXTAS , some men may only exhibit some of the symptoms, and may not develop all of the cardinal features of the condition.  For men who are premutation carriers, the chance of developing core symptoms of FXTAS (tremor, problems with walking/balance) increases with age.  From age 50-59 the chance is about 17%.  From age 60-69 about 38%.  From age 70-79 about 47%.  Over 80 years old, about 75% will develop symptoms of FXTAS.  Studies of females have found that about 8-16% of premutation carriers, within families already known to have someone with a Fragile X condition, develop some FXTAS symptoms. The symptoms in females tend to be milder.  FXTAS may be one of the most common adult onset, single-gene neurological diseases; similar in prevalence to other neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease); however more studies within the general population will be necessary before the true incidence is known.   Prevalence of FXPOI  Approximately 20-25% of women with an FMR1 premutation will develop FXPOI . FXPOI covers a range of ovarian difficulties including early menopause, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, sub fertility and premature ovarian failure (cessation of menstrual periods prior to age 40)   How Common are Intermediate (Grey Area) Alleles?  Approximately 1 in 50 (2%) of individuals have an intermediate allele . There appear to be no clinical associations with intermediate alleles. Most intermediate alleles are stable and do not change over generations. In a small number of families intermediate alleles show some slight instability and can lead to a premutation in future generations. Individuals with an intermediate allele are not at risk for any for the FXDs or to have children with Fragile X syndrome.  Based on the best available evidence:  Approximately 1 million Americans carry the Fragile X mutation, including approximately 100,000 with Fragile X syndrome, and are at risk for developing a Fragile X-associated Disorder.  Approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: The vast majority of males with the full mutation will have Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females in the world are born with the full mutation for Fragile X. Note: Approximately 50% of females with the full mutation will have some features of Fragile X syndrome.  Approximately 1 in 468 men in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.  Approximately 1 in 151 women in the world are carriers of the Fragile X premutation.       male chromosomes   Female Chromosomes     Genetics and Inheritance        What Are Chromosomes?  Our bodies are made up of about 60 trillion cells. Each one of those cells manufactures proteins. The kinds of proteins any given cell makes determine its particular characteristics, which in turn create the characteristics of the entire body.  The instructions for making these proteins are stored in chemicals or molecules called DNA, which is organized into chromosomes. Chromosomes are found in the center, or nucleus, of all of our cells, including the eggs and sperm.  Chromosomes are passed down from generation to generation through the egg and sperm. Typically, we all have 46 chromosomes in our cells, two of which are sex chromosomes. In females, these are two Xs; in males they are an X and a Y.    The Role of Genes?  Genes are sections of DNA that are passed from generation to generation and perform one function. If we think of DNA as letters in the alphabet, the genes are words and the chromosome is a full sentence. All 46 chromosomes then make up the whole book.  There are many genes on each chromosome; we all have tens of thousands of genes that instruct our bodies on how to develop.  Genes are given names to identify them and the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome is called FMR1. The FMR1 Gene is on the X chromosome.    How Do Changes in the FMR1 Gene Lead to FXS?  The FMR1 gene appears in four forms that are defined by the number of repeats of a pattern of DNA called CGG repeats.  Individuals with less than 45 CGG repeats have a normal FMR1 gene. Those with 45-54 CGG repeats have what is called an “intermediate” or “grey zone allele,” which does not cause any of the known Fragile X associated disorders.  Individuals with 55-200 CGG repeats have a “premutation,” which means they carry an unstable mutation of the gene that can expand in future generations and thus cause Fragile X syndrome in their children or grandchildren. Individuals with a premutation can also develop FXTAS or FXPOI themselves.  Individuals with over 200 CGG repeats have a full mutation of the FMR1 gene, which causes Fragile X syndrome.  The full mutation causes the FMR1 gene to shut down or “methylate” in one region. Normally, the FMR1 gene produces an important protein called FMRP. When the gene is turned off, the individual does not make this protein. The lack of this specific protein is what causes Fragile X syndrome.    The Fragile X Premutation  Fragile X-associated Disorders are a group of conditions called trinucleotide repeat disorders. A common feature of these conditions is that the gene can change sizes over generations, becoming more unstable, and thus the conditions may occur more frequently or severely in subsequent generations. These conditions are often caused by a gene change that begins with a premutation and then expands to a full mutation in subsequent generations.  Approximately 1 in 151 females and 1 in 468 males carry the FMR1 premutation. They are thus “carriers” of the premutation.  Premutations are defined as having 55-200 CGG repeats and can occur in both males and females. When a father passes the premutation on to his daughters, it usually does not expand to a full mutation. A man never passes the Fragile X gene to his sons, since he passes only his Y chromosome to them, which does not contain a Fragile X gene.  A female with the FMR1 premutation will often pass on a larger version of the mutation to her children (more on this point below). She also has a 50 percent chance of passing on her normal X chromosome in each pregnancy, since usually only one of her X chromosomes has the FMR1 mutation.  The chance of the premutation expanding to a full mutation is related to the size of the mother’s premutation. The larger the mother’s CGG repeat number, the higher the chance that it will expand to a full mutation if it is passed on.  Typically, the premutation has no immediate and observable impact on a person’s appearance or health. However, some females with a premutation will experience Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) , which causes infertility, irregular or missed menstrual cycles, and/or early menopause.  Additionally, some older adults with a premutation may develop a neurological condition called FXTAS , (Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder.  FXTAS and FXPOI are part of the family of conditions called Fragile X-associated Disorders.    The FMR1 Full Mutation  A full mutation is defined as having over 200 CGG repeats and causes that indicate the presence of Fragile X syndrome in males and some females. Most full mutation expansions have some degree of Methylation (the process which “turns off” the gene). Males with a full mutation will have Fragile X Syndrome , though with varying degrees of severity  About 65-70 percent of females with a full mutation exhibit some difficulties with cognitive, learning, behavioral, or social functioning, and may also have some of the physical features of FXS (such as large ears or a long face). The remaining 30-35 percent are at risk to develop mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, or they may have no observable effects of the full mutation.    Inheritance  Fragile X in an “X-linked” condition, which means that the gene is on the X chromosome.  Since a woman has two X chromosomes a woman with a premutation or full mutation has a 50% chance of passing on the X with the mutation in each pregnancy, and a 50% chance of passing on her normal X.  If she has a premutation, and it is passed on (to either males or females), it can remain a premutation or it can expand to a full mutation. If she has a full mutation and it is passed on (to either males or females), it will remain a full mutation.  Because males have only one X chromosome, fathers who carry the premutation will pass it on to all their daughters and none of their sons (they pass their Y chromosome on to their sons). There have been no reports of premutations that are passed from a father to his daughter expanding to a full mutation. This appears to only occur when passed from a mother to her children.    Unique Features of Fragile X Inheritance  In many X-linked conditions only males who inherit the abnormal gene are affected. Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked conditions that can also affect females.  Additionally, in other X-linked conditions all males who carry the abnormal form of the gene are affected. In Fragile X syndrome, unaffected males can carry the gene in the premutation form while themselves having no symptoms of the condition.        FMR1 Gene    What Is a Gene?  A gene is a unit of heredity that is passed down from parent to child. Genes are located on chromosomes that are in all of our cells, including the sperm and egg that make a baby.   What Is a Gene Made Of?  Genes are made of molecules or chemicals called DNA. The pattern of DNA will determine if the gene is working properly. The DNA has to be in a certain pattern or order, like the numbers in a phone number.   How Does a Gene Work?  A gene has different parts that work together like a factory or machine. It has a “promoter” that turns the gene on, like a light switch. It has sections that are just “filler” and act as place holders, called “introns.” The sections that are used to make a protein or do a job are called “exons.”   What Do Genes Do?  The job of a gene is to either make a protein, the building blocks of all the structures in the body, or to regulate other proteins in the body.   How Does a Gene Make Proteins?  The DNA in the gene is a code that is “transcribed” or “talks” to another kind of molecule called RNA. This is like one side of Velcro sticking to another that it matches up to. The RNA then “translates” the DNA to put together the protein.     Now that you understand what genes are, let’s discuss the Fragile X gene…   The Fragile X ( FMR1 ) Gene   Why Is It Called the FMR1 Gene?  Genes are named when they are discovered. Often the name isn’t exactly the same as the condition, in case it is later discovered that there is more than one gene involved in the condition. The gene that causes Fragile X is called the “ FMR1 gene,” which stands for Fragile X mental retardation gene. Though the term “mental retardation” has given way in recent years to the more generally accepted term of “intellectual disabilities,” the scientific name of the gene can’t change with the times.    Ideogram of X chromosome    Where Is the FMR1 Gene Located?  The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome. We all have 46 chromosomes in all of our cells, 44 of which are numbered 1-22 in pairs. Then females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Each chromosome has two arms, one called the “p” arm (the short arm) and one called the “q” arm (the long arm).  There are many genes on each chromosome, like houses on a street. Each gene is given an address, depending on where it lies on the chromosome. The address of the FMR1 gene is Xq27.3   Does Everyone Have an FMR1 Gene?  Yes, everyone has an FMR1 gene. When someone states, “I have the gene for Fragile X,” they really mean they have a gene mutation for Fragile X. Some Fragile X genes are normal and some are not.   What Does the FMR1 Gene Do?  The FMR1 gene makes a very important protein called FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein). Though this protein is found in all our cells, it is most abundant in the nerve cells, and particularly in a part of the nerve cell that “talks” to other nerve cells called “dendrites.”    What Is an FMR1 Gene Mutation?  A mutation is any change in a gene. Some mutations don’t cause any problems and we don’t know about them (unless found in the laboratory). Mutations in the FMR1 gene involve an abnormal expansion of the DNA in the “promoter” area of the gene. Often a mutation causes decreased or absent protein production. In individuals with a “ full mutation ,” their FMR1 gene is shut down and they don’t make enough or any FMRP.   Are There Different Kinds of FMR1 Mutations?  Yes. An individual can have a normal FMR1 gene, a “ premutation ” or a “ full mutation .” There is also another category called an “intermediate allele,” which is not a true mutation, but an expansion somewhere between the “normal” FMR1 gene and the premutation.   What Is the Difference Between These Mutations?    FMR1 Gene Categories   The mutation of the FMR1 gene involves a repeating pattern of DNA called a “CGG repeat.” DNA is made of molecules that are abbreviated A, C, G and T. A CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene is a pattern of DNA that may repeats itself anywhere from 30 to 1000 times. In the FMR1 gene there is an area of the promoter that is rich in these CGG repeats and is measured when Fragile X testing is performed.  In this area, there is normally about 30 repeats of CGG. In individuals with the premutation, there are from 55-200 of these repeats. Persons with the full mutation have more than 200 of the CGG repeats. When there is more than 200 CGG repeats, the gene is turned off by a process called Methylation .  Methylation happens to other genes too, when they are supposed to be turned off (as in the genes we don’t use, like those that make a tail grow!). In Fragile X the methylation turns off the FMR1 gene, so no FMRP is produced. This is what causes Fragile X Syndrome .   FMRP – The Fragile X Protein   Each cell works somewhat like a factory. The external membrane functions as the exterior walls of the factory. The nucleus stores the genetic blueprints in the form of DNA. The machinery (ribosomes) for assembling the products (proteins) is attached to the shop floor (endoplasmic reticulum). The Golgi concentrates the proteins to export them. The lysosome is used for waste disposal and recycling.   What Do Proteins Do?    Used with permission of Paul Thiessen Chemical Graphics   The body makes about 50,000 different kinds of protein. These proteins serve in two major roles. Some of them make up part of the structure of our bodies. Others are enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that works like a tool. It helps a particular chemical reaction take place.  For example, there is a particular enzyme that breaks apart starch into sugar molecules; you use it in your small intestine to digest your carbohydrates. Another enzyme takes a sugar molecule and adds a phosphate onto it to make it unstable. Then a series of about 20 more enzymes each process the unstable sugar molecule in a disassembly line that pulls the sugar molecule apart and releases energy.  Proteins are made out of 20 different amino acids like leucine, lysine, tryptophan, etc. When you eat foods that contain proteins, the first thing your digestive system does is to break them down into amino acids. Then you assemble those amino acids into your own proteins. In a way, it is like words. You can make all kinds of words out of 26 letters. You could take a magazine, cut apart all of the letters and reassemble them into your own words. The proteins you make are assembled out of the parts from the proteins you digested from your food.  Fragile X syndrome is caused because people with the disease don’t make a particular protein, FMRP. Sometimes someone asks why we can’t just feed a person with Fragile X more protein. The problem is not lack of protein; a bunch of proteins won’t help someone who is missing FMRP. It is a specific protein that is missing, not proteins in general.  To understand this, think about someone who is trying to say the word “frozen”. Handing the person a list of names from the phone book won’t help. In the same way, having someone eat a bunch of proteins won’t give the person the specific protein that is needed.  Even if we injected that person with lots of FMRP, it would not help. FMRP needs to be present in the right cells at the right time in the right amount.  We are just beginning to learn which cells normally make FMRP. We have some clues about what the function of FMRP is but we have much to learn.    Used with Permission of Dennis Kunkel’s Image Gallery   The synthesis of a protein such as FMRP (Fragile X mental retardation protein) begins in the nucleus of the cell when the DNA receives a request for that specific information. It is a bit like someone going to a library and selecting a particular book. In response to the request, the DNA opens up and a copy of the coded information is transcribed, much like someone photocopies a chapter of a book in a library. That copy of the DNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA).  The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes out to the main part of the cell, the cytoplasm. There the coded mRNA is translated on ribosomes with the help of transfer RNA and a protein is assembled out of amino acids.  The protein takes on a particular shape that allows it to perform very specific tasks. While we know the tasks of some of the proteins that humans make, we only have hints about the role of FMRP.   Methylation     Used with permission of New England Biolabs   One of the ways the cells control which genetic information they will use is to chemically modify the DNA. The illustration on the left shows an enzyme (diagrammed in ribbons) adding methyl groups to some of the DNA (balls in the form of a double helix). This inactivates that part of the chromosome. It’s as if we were to put glue on the edges of some of the books in the library; those pages would become unavailable to readers.   Good methylation  In females methylation is used regularly to solve a problem. Men have only one X chromosome and women have two. As a result, female cells might be expected to make twice as much protein from the information on X chromosomes as males do. Instead, women’s cells randomly pick one of the X chromosomes and turn it off by methylation. Thus both males and females have one working X chromosome in each cell and as a result, one working unit of all the genetic information on the X chromosome.   Bad methylation  As noted above, methylation is generally a useful method for turning off chromosomal information. However, in Fragile X syndrome, methylation is involved in causing the disease. Near the FMR1 Gene is a regulatory site called a CpG island. In most people, the site is not methylated. As a result, the cell can use the FMR1 gene when there is a need for FMRP – The Fragile X Protein .  In people with Fragile X syndrome, the CpG island is methylated. As a result, the cell is unable to copy the information in the FMR1 gene. Since an mRNA copy is not made, FMRP will not be synthesized. Since there is no FMRP at the time and place it is needed, the characteristics of Fragile X syndrome are set in motion.   It’s not really the CGG’s  Much of the focus on Fragile X syndrome is on the expansion of the repeated CGG’s . It is technically not the expansion that directly causes the problem. Instead, having more than 230 CGG repeats sets in motion methylation of part of the FMR1 gene. The methylation stops the synthesis of FMRP and the absence of FMRP causes Fragile X syndrome. We do not know why having too many CGG repeats triggers methylation.  In theory, if the methylation could be removed from that spot on the FMR1 gene, it could allow access to the FMR1 gene and allow its FMRP product to be assembled. This is one of the potential treatment areas that researchers are investigating.   Mosaic females  The inactivation of female X chromosomes by methylation mentioned above, also seems to partially determine the impact of a full Fragile X mutation on females. Each cell in a female will inactivate or turn off one of its two X chromosomes.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the Fragile X mutation, then most of the cells will have an active X chromosome that can produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be limited.  If a large proportion of the cells turn off the X chromosome with the working FMR1, then there will be few cells able to produce FMRP. As a result, the impact of Fragile X syndrome will be more pronounced.  So the severity of Fragile X syndrome on a female depends in part on whether her cells turn off mainly X chromosomes with a good FMR1 or mainly X chromosomes with a defective FMR1.   What Is Genetic Counseling?       What Does a Genetic Counselor Do?  A genetic counselor is a trained master’s level medical professional who works with individuals and families to:  Review genetic testing and diagnoses.  Review inheritance patterns.  Help identify possible carriers in the family.  Discuss the symptoms and features of Fragile X-associated Disorders.  When appropriate, review reproductive issues and options.  Make referrals and provide professional and emotional support.  Due to the complexity of Fragile X testing, the counselor is essential in the interpretation of results and for providing accurate information regarding Fragile X.   Where Do Genetic Counselors Work?  Genetic counselors can work either independently or are part of a medical team.  Some common settings where genetic counselors work are:  Medical genetics departments in a hospital/medical center setting.  Prenatal, perinatal or infertility care providers.  Specialist medical groups such as oncology, hematology, neurology, cardiology.  Multidisciplinary clinics such as craniofacial, skeletal dysplasia, Fragile X clinics.  Private practice.  Public and community health settings.  Genetics laboratories.  Support organizations (such as the NFXF).   Who Should Meet With a Genetic Counselor?  Anyone who:  Has been identified as being a “Fragile X carrier” or has positive, inconclusive or, in any way unusual Fragile X testing results.  Has a family member who has been identified as being a carrier of a Fragile X mutation.  Has a child or family member diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome or any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Has a family or personal  history of undiagnosed intellectual disabilities, autism or learning disorders.  Has symptoms of any of the Fragile X-associated Disorders, including infertility, early menopause and/or adult onset neurological or movement disorders.   What Will Likely Occur in a Genetic Counseling Session?  The counselor:  Will ask questions regarding the  medical or developmental/learning history of your family members (including children, parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, grandparents).  Will review the genetic implications of the diagnosis or test results.  May identify other family members who may have inherited the gene mutation.  May make suggestions or assist with informing or contacting family members regarding testing.  May meet with you either independently or in conjunction with a medical geneticist or other provider, who will likely examine your child or affected family member. If the counseling will be focused on carrier testing, an exam is often not indicated.  Can work with you and other family members to coordinate testing throughout the family.  Can provide information and help with decision-making regarding reproductive issues and options and coordinate/arrange any further testing.  Can make referrals to other providers for medical evaluations and care, prenatal care and  testing, therapies for your child, family counseling, or whatever needs you have at the time.   How Do You Find a Genetic Counselor in Your Area?  Ask your doctor or provider for a referral to a local genetic counselor.

I Was Just Figuring Out CGG Repeats! Most of us have heard of CGG repeats, those patterns of DNA molecules that are counted when testing for Fragile X (FMR1) mutations. (For background, see the Q & A with Dr. Karen Usdin on page 16.) We then hear a number like 400 for full mutations or 80 for premutations and that’s it, nothing else matters but that magic number. We envision a long tract of CGGCGGCGGCGG over and over again, as the genetic counselor or doctor described. But lately you may also have begun hearing about “AGG interruptions,” which in some way are related to Fragile X inheritance. This article will offer an overview of their importance.   To review some genetics, DNA is a strand of chemicals, called nucleotides. The nucleotides that make up DNA are Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine (abbreviated as A, T, C and G). So a CGG repeat is a triplet of cytosine, guanine and guanine. The pattern of nucleotides (like ATCGATCG, etc.) makes up a gene that instructs the cell on how to make or regulate proteins.  In the 1990s, after the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the CGG repeat expansion that causes Fragile X syndrome, Fragile X experts began talking about a different DNA pattern called an “AGG interruption,” which occurs between about every nine or 10 CGGs. In the normal Fragile X gene (five to 45 repeats), you might have a 30-CGG-repeat pattern that has 10 CGGs, one AGG, then 10 CGGs, then one AGG, then another 10 CGGs. These AGG interruptions act as a sort of anchor, keeping the 30-repeat FMR1 gene stable, like fence posts every 10 feet in a long fence.  As DNA samples were being studied by Fragile X researchers, they found that while some individuals had AGG interruptions every nine or 10 CGG repeats, some lost them as the repeats got bigger. So a person might have 10 CGGs then one AGG, 10 CGGs then one AGG, then 40 CGGs in an individual who has 60 CGG repeats.  This led to two questions regarding the presence or pattern of AGG interruptions: 1) Do the number or placement of AGG interruptions affect the stability of the FMR1 gene? 2) “Why do some premutations expand and some not?”  A recent study by Dr. Sarah Nolin at Institute of Basic Research in New York, Dr. Elizabeth Berry-Kravis at Rush Medical Center in Chicago and Asuragen Inc. in Austin, Texas was presented in a poster at the annual meeting of the American College on Medical Genetics earlier this year. The purpose of the study was to see how AGG interruptions affect the stability of the premutation, and also to develop (and use) the technology that would identify these AGG interruptions in Fragile X testing.  The study found that if there were 33 or fewer CGGs in a row beyond the last AGG, then the premutation usually didn’t expand. But when there were 39 or more CGGs in a row after the last AGG, without any AGG interruptions, then the premutation was usually unstable (expanding by one or more CGG repeats). This helps us understand why some premutations with, for example, 62 CGG repeats, appear stable over generations, whereas some with the same number of 62 repeats expand over subsequent generations. It’s because the one with a long tract (>39 repeats) of CGG repeats without an AGG “anchor” is more likely to expand than one with properly interspersed AGG interruptions.  The technology that was developed to identify the presence and placement of the AGG interruptions is new and exciting. Asuragen, in cooperation with the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute, has developed a unique type of PC test (see below) called “Amplidex.” It can identify the AGG interruptions in both males and females and in both normal and expanded FMR1 genes.  For scientific reasons, labs have had a hard time finding AGG interruptions, especially in women. This new technology overcomes these hurdles. Variations on a genetic testing method called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, reveal the number and location of AGG interruptions. Three different PCR studies done together show very different patterns of the CGG repeat region when AGG interruptions are present. Specially trained experts in a laboratory can review all three studies to solve the problem of where the AGG interruptions are located; the method is similar to solving a brainteaser puzzle.  This test is currently available only for research studies. Eventually it may be available for clinical use. So it is possible that in addition to the “magic number” of CGG repeats, the presence and placement of AGG interruptions will inform your risk for expansion of a premutation.  Why it Matters  There are a number of reasons why this issue of AGG interruptions is important.  First, if you or a family member have a premutation that hasn’t expanded to a full mutation, this technology may give you more accurate risk figures for that premutation to expand.  Second, it is possible that the number of AGG interruptions may contribute to or affect the risk for FXPOI or FXTAS. The risk for FXPOI is about 20–25 percent in female premutation carriers; the risk for FXTAS is about 30–40 percent in male and 5–8 percent in female carriers. At this point we don’t have good “predictors” of who may develop these two conditions. It is possible that this technology identifying AGG interruptions may lead us to better predict the group at highest (and lowest) risk for these Fragile X-associated Disorders.  Third, it is possible that our knowledge of AGG interruptions might lead to better understanding of the small subset of children with premutations who have developmental disorders like autism, ADHD, etc. We know this is clearly a small group, since most premutation carriers exhibit normal development and cognitive function. However, there is a small subset of (mostly male) children in the premutation range who have developmental/behavioral disorders, and this new technology might give us some clues as to why they are affected, even though most carriers are not.  All of which leads to the possibility that you may soon hear, “I have 65 repeats with three AGG interruptions, ya-hoo!”       Copyright 2017 National Fragile X Foundation 1861 International Drive Suite 200, McLean, VA  22102, (800) 688-8765 Powered by PRI .

Genes determine many things about the person. For example, what the person will look like and whether he or she is likely to have certain illnesses. In addition, genes have instructions for making proteins in the cells. Proteins are needed for the body to work correctly.  FXS is caused by a change in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The FMR1 gene makes a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that is needed for normal brain development.  Chromosomes  Genes are found on chromosomes. Every human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. People get their chromosomes from their parents. People get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from their father. The chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They decide if a person is male or female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).  The FMR1 gene is on the X chromosome.  DNA  The chromosomes and genes have a special code called DNA. DNA has four chemical letters, called “bases”: A, C, T, and G. The order of the letters determines the information carried in each gene, like the way that a specific pattern of letters makes up the words in a sentence.  How FXS is Inherited  There is a place in the FMR1 gene where the DNA pattern CGG is repeated over and over again. In most people, the number of repeats is small (5 to 44 repeats), which is normal. If the number of repeats is too large (more than 200 repeats), the gene turns off. When the gene is turned off, no protein is made. Without the protein, the person develops FXS. This is called a “trinucleotide repeat disorder.” People get (inherit) the disorder from their parents.

Normal: 5 to 44 Repeats  Most people have about 5 to 44 repeats of the letters CGG in their FMR1 genes. This is considered a normal number of repeats. People with a normal number of repeats do not have FXS and are not at risk for having children with FXS.  Intermediate: 45 to 54 Repeats  People who have an intermediate number of repeats (about 45 to 54) do not have FXS. However, they may have a slightly higher chance of having some symptoms.  Premutation: 55 to 200 Repeats  People who have a premutation (about 55 to 200 repeats) do not have FXS. However, they might have another fragile X-associated disorder and related concerns . In addition, people with a premutation can have children with a premutation or full mutation (FXS).   With each pregnancy, women have a 50% chance of passing the premutation or full mutation on to their child (daughters or sons). The more CGG repeats the mother has, the more likely her child will have full mutation fragile X.  Men will have daughters with a premutation, but sons will not be affected.   Full Mutation (FXS): More than 200 Repeats  People with a full mutation (more than 200 repeats) have FXS.

One Gene Shuts Down    Fragile X is caused by a mutation in a single gene. In people with Fragile X, a defect (a full mutation) turns the gene off. Like a defective factory, it cannot manufacture the protein that it normally makes.    Fragile X Syndrome is a Common Rare Disease    Fragile X affects 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 6000 females of all races and ethnic groups (source CDC ). About 1 in 259 women carry fragile X and could pass it to their children. About 1 in 800 men carry Fragile X; their daughters will also be carriers.  Fragile X syndrome is the #1 inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and the most common known cause of autism worldwide. Most people with Fragile X are not yet diagnosed.          Fragile X is Inherited    A mother who carries Fragile X has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her children. Her children will either be carriers or they will be have Fragile X syndrome.  Carrier men will pass the premutation to all their daughters but none of their sons. These daughters are carriers but they do not have Fragile X syndrome.  The Fragile X premutation can be passed silently down through generations in a family before a child is born with the syndrome.  More About Genes and Inheritance  Each cell in the body contains forty-six (twenty-three pairs of) chromosomes. These chromosomes consist of genetic material (DNA) necessary for the production of proteins which lead to growth, development and physical and intellectual characteristics. The first twenty-two pairs of chromosomes are the same in males and females. The remaining two chromosomes, X and Y, determine whether a person is male or female. Males have only one X chromosome which is inherited from the mother. They receive a Y chromosome from the father. Females inherit two X chromosomes, one from each parent.    Simple Cause, Complex Disease    This gene, called FMR1 for Fragile X Mental Retardation–1 , was discovered in 1991 by Drs. Ben Oostra, David Nelson, and Stephen Warren. Drs. Oostra, Nelson, and Warren named this mutation FRAXA . It causes almost all cases of Fragile X syndrome.    The Fragile X Gene    The FMR1 gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome. At the start of this gene lies a region of DNA which varies in length from one person to another. Ordinarily, this stretch of DNA falls within a range of length that would be considered “normal”. In some people, however, this stretch of DNA is somewhat longer; this gene change is a premutation . This stretch of DNA is prone to further expansion when it is passed from a woman to her children.      When the stretch of DNA expands beyond a certain length, the gene is switched off and does not produce the protein that it is normally makes. This gene change is called a full mutation . A male who inherits a full mutation exhibits Fragile X syndrome because his only X chromosome contains the mutated gene. A female may not be as severely affected because each cell of her body needs to use only one of its two X chromosomes and randomly inactivates the other.    Carriers, FXTAS, and POI    Carriers have a small mutation in FMR1 (a premutation ). Carriers do not show symptoms of fragile X syndrome, but they may be at risk for related disorders such as Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). Women who carry Fragile X may be at risk for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency which causes early menopause.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a study in 2012 which pegs the prevalence of carriers at:   1 in 151 females, or about 1 million women in the United States.  1 in 468 males, or about 320,000 men in the United States.

Description        Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Usually, males are more severely affected by this disorder than females. Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age 2. Most males with fragile X syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while about one-third of affected females are intellectually disabled. Children with fragile X syndrome may also have anxiety and hyperactive behavior such as fidgeting or impulsive actions. They may have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which includes an impaired ability to maintain attention and difficulty focusing on specific tasks. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction. Seizures occur in about 15 percent of males and about 5 percent of females with fragile X syndrome . Most males and about half of females with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that become more apparent with age. These features include a long and narrow face , large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet , and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after puberty.

Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center          Frequency        Fragile X syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.      Related Information    What information about a genetic condition can statistics provide? Why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethnic groups?          Genetic Changes        Mutations in the FMR1 gene cause fragile X syndrome . The FMR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP. This protein helps regulate the production of other proteins and plays a role in the development of synapses , which are specialized connections between nerve cells. Synapses are critical for relaying nerve impulses. Nearly all cases of fragile X syndrome are caused by a mutation in which a DNA segment, known as the CGG triplet repeat, is expanded within the FMR1 gene. Normally, this DNA segment is repeated from 5 to about 40 times. In people with fragile X syndrome , however, the CGG segment is repeated more than 200 times. The abnormally expanded CGG segment turns off (silences) the FMR1 gene, which prevents the gene from producing FMRP. Loss or a shortage (deficiency) of this protein disrupts nervous system functions and leads to the signs and symptoms of fragile X syndrome . Males and females with 55 to 200 repeats of the CGG segment are said to have an FMR1 gene premutation. Most people with a premutation are intellectually normal. In some cases, however, individuals with a premutation have lower than normal amounts of FMRP. As a result, they may have mild versions of the physical features seen in fragile X syndrome (such as prominent ears) and may experience emotional problems such as anxiety or depression. Some children with a premutation may have learning disabilities or autistic-like behavior. The premutation is also associated with an increased risk of disorders called fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).

How can gene mutations affect health and development? More about Mutations and Health          Inheritance Pattern        Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern . A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome , one of the two sex chromosomes. (The Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome.) The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. X-linked dominant means that in females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome ), a mutation in the only copy of a gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. In women, the FMR1 gene premutation on the X chromosome can expand to more than 200 CGG repeats in cells that develop into eggs. This means that women with the premutation have an increased risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome . By contrast, the premutation in men does not expand to more than 200 repeats as it is passed to the next generation. Men pass the premutation only to their daughters. Their sons receive a Y chromosome , which does not include the FMR1 gene.      Related Information    What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?

Diseases          Back to Diseases           English   Español       Hi. My wife is a carrier of fragile X, with 80 repeats on one X. (There is no history of Fragile X in her family, and our son is not affected.)  What are the chances that our children will have fragile X?  Just a side question, her father has green/red color blindness. Could this have any significance? Assuming the Fragile X was inherited from her mother, does this mean our sons would all either have the Fragile X gene or be colorblind?       -A curious adult from Israel  With your wife's premutation (see below), there is a 30-40% risk of your son, and probably your daughter, of having a full mutation.  However, while nearly all boys with the full mutation will show signs of the disease, only half of the girls will.  Fragile X is the most common form of inherited mental retardation.  About 1 in 4000 males have Fragile X, while only half as many females have it.  Fragile X is caused by mutation of a gene on the X chromosome called FMR-1.  We don't know exactly what FMR-1 does, but it may be involved in forming the brain.  Males who inherit the mutation are always affected because they only have one X chromosome.  (Remember, females have two X chromosomes, males an X and a Y.)  In females the outcome is variable.  About half of women who inherit the mutation have the disease.  Usually it is a milder form than that seen in males.  In other cases, the normal X chromosome provides enough FMR-1 protein to prevent brain defects.  So how does someone get Fragile X?  Fragile X happens when a certain part of the FMR-1 gene gets too long.  There is a part of the gene that normally has between 6 and 54 repeats of the same 3 bases.  For most people, the number of repeats stays pretty stable.  Then, for reasons we don't understand, the number of repeats begins to increase.  When the number of repeats is above 55, the gene is now said to have a premutation.  A premutation is pretty unstable and the number of repeats increases over generations.  Once there are 200 or so repeats, the symptoms of the disease kick in.  What happens at 200 repeats is that no FMR-1 protein is made from that copy of the gene.  All those repeats act like a skip in a record that blocks the song from finishing.  The DNA can't be read through to make the FMR-1 protein.  As you can probably tell, Fragile X inheritance is pretty complicated.  The bottom line is that you can only get the full mutation from your mother.  A premutation passed through a father usually expands only a little or not at all.  So, his daughters will also have a premutation on one of their X chromosomes.  His sons inherit his Y chromosome--no Fragile X risk!  With moms, it is a different story.  In female carriers, the repeat sequences can expand when passed down to her children.  Can a geneticist say when a premutation will turn into a full mutation?  Regrettably, that's not possible with current tests.  However, the longer the premutation, the greater the risk of expansion to full mutation size.  Females with the full mutation have a 50% chance of passing that mutation to their children.  Since she can't get an X with the mutation from her dad, she can only have one X with the mutation at a time.  Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the X with the mutation.  Most of the possible combinations are outlined in the table below.  Father  Mother  Son  Daughter  XY No disease  XX No disease  XY No disease  XX No disease  X pre Y Carrier  XX No disease  XY No disease  X pre X Carrier  XY No disease  X pre X Carrier  X pre Y XY 50% chance of either carrier or Fragile X  X pre X XX 50% chance of either carrier or Fragile X  XY No disease  X mut X 50% chance of having Fragile X  X mut Y XY 50% chance of Fragile X  X mut X XX 50% chance of mutation, 25% chance of Fragile X  (This is oversimplified a bit as the actual percentages are lower.  This is because of something called mosaicism which is fairly common with Fragile X.  To learn more about mosaicism, go to mosaicism in the GeneTests glossary .)  Now if you really want to get into colorblindness, keep reading!  The gene that causes red/green color blindness is located on the X chromosome, like the Fragile X gene.  You are right to suggest that your sons will inherit one of your wife's two X chromosomes, with either a Fragile X mutation, or the color blindness gene.  The four possible combinations are diagrammed.  Sons (XY) will be either colorblind (ColBl), or inherit an abnormal Fragile X (FraX) gene.  Daughters, XX, will be carriers for either the colorblind mutation or Fragile X.  While one color blindness gene in a female will have no effect, the Fragile X gene could cause disease.  How is color blindness inherited?  It is a recessive trait, meaning that as long as one good copy of the gene is around, color vision is normal.  Since males have only one X chromosome, they are always affected by color blindness if they inherit a mutant gene.  Females have two Xs so they are rarely affected.  It can happen though, if they inherit a mutant gene from both their father (who would be colorblind) and their mother (who is a carrier).  So, while the genes for red-green color blindness and Fragile X are both located on the X chromosome, they are inherited differently. The outcome for color blindness is predictable. An abnormal Fragile X gene is unstable and can change in each generation.

Did I do anything to cause fragile X syndrome? No. There is nothing you did before or during the pregnancy or after your child was born to cause fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is genetic which means it is caused by a change in a gene, in this case, the FMR1 gene. The change causes the gene not to work the way it should, leading to the problems seen in fragile X syndrome.  Because fragile X syndrome is genetic, it can be passed on and you are at risk for having another child with fragile X syndrome. It is important to know that you have no control over whether this change gets passed on to your child or not. In addition, other family members may also be at risk of having children with fragile X syndrome, so it is important to inform them of your child's diagnosis.   2. What does cause fragile X syndrome? Explaining how fragile X happens is not very easy simply because of the way it is inherited. To start, let's talk broadly about genes and chromosomes. Genes are the instructions that tell our bodies how to work and are made up of DNA. We inherit two copies of all of our genes: one copy from our mother and one copy from our father. The DNA is packed into larger structures called chromosomes, and each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of genes. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. The first 22 pairs are the same in males and females and are called the autosomes. The 23rd pair, called the sex chromosomes, are different in males and females. Females have two "X" chromosomes, and males have one "X" and one "Y" chromosome.  Fragile X is caused by a change in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome that causes it not to work properly. Everyone has 6-10 genes that don't work the way they should, but this generally does not cause a problem. However, the change in the FMR1 gene does make a difference. This change (also called a mutation) in the FMR1 gene is complex and occurs over many generations.  The FMR1 gene contains a section of repetitive DNA that in most of the population is only 10-40 repeats long. In those with fragile X syndrome, this repeated region has expanded to over 200 repeats. When a repeat length is greater than 200, it is referred to as a full mutation or expansion. At this size, the FMR1 gene cannot function and the FMR1 protein cannot be produced. It is the inability of cells to make this protein that is responsible for fragile X syndrome.  In general, every person gets two copies of every gene. This is a little bit different for the FMR1 gene because it is on the "X" chromosome. Because males have only one "X" chromosome, they have only one copy of the FMR1 gene. If they have a full mutation, their one copy of the FMR1 gene is not working, and one sees the signs of fragile X syndrome. Because females have two "X" chromosomes and 2 copies of the FMR1 gene, if a girl inherits a full mutation, the other copy of the gene is usually working, so girls with a full mutation are still able to make FMR1 protein. This is why girls usually have fewer signs of fragile X than boys do.  In general, we expect to see the full mutation in every cell of a person with fragile X syndrome. Sometimes, however, an individual with fragile X syndrome can have what is called mosaicism. There are two kinds of mosaicism in fragile X syndrome: repeat size mosaicism and methylation mosaicism. In repeat size mosaicism, an individual has some cells that have a full mutation and some cells that have a premutation. In methylation mosaicism, all the cells have a full mutation, but the methylation pattern may not be the same in all cells. Some research studies have shown that individuals with repeat size or methylation mosaicism may be less affected than those who do not have mosaicism.   3. What is methylation? Methylation is a process in which a chemical group, called a methyl group, gets added to the DNA. When enough methyl groups are added to the DNA, the gene gets turned off. When methyl groups are removed, the gene gets turned on. This is a normal process and many of our genes are controlled by methylation. However, in fragile X syndrome, the methylation of the FMR1 gene turns the gene off when it should be turned on. When FMR1 is turned off, its protein is not made, and you see the features of fragile X syndrome.  When someone with fragile X syndrome has methylation mosaicism, not all cells will have the FMR1 gene turned off by methylation. Some cells may have it partially turned off, and some cells may have the FMR1 gene turned on.   4. I heard only boys have fragile X syndrome. Why does my daughter have it also? Girls can also have fragile X syndrome even though they have two "X" chromosomes. The reason is that they have a full expansion on one chromosome and a normal repeat section (in most cases) on the other chromosome. The copy with the full expansion is not making any FMR1 protein, while the other copy (the normal repeat section) is making protein. Although some protein is being made, it may not be enough, so we can see characteristics of fragile X syndrome. However, because some protein is being made, girls with fragile X syndrome are generally less affected than boys.   5. Is there a cure? At this time, there is no cure for fragile X syndrome. Treatment for fragile X syndrome is provided through therapies such as special education, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy. Medications may be helpful in managing hyperactivity, short attention span, and other behavioral or emotional problems. In order to determine the best course of action for your child, a comprehensive evaluation is recommended.  Family Members and Family Planning   6. Could my brothers and sisters have children with fragile X syndrome? For moms, yes, your siblings and also your cousins are at risk for having children with fragile X syndrome. For dads, it is possible but unlikely. Why is this the case? To begin with, the repetitive region in the FMR1 gene expands through generations. There is an intermediate expansion, called the fragile X premutation, that is about 60-200 repeats in length. Individuals with a repeat length of this size are called premutation carriers and do not have symptoms associated with fragile X syndrome. However, the premutation is unstable and can expand to the full mutation in future generations. For reasons that are not well understood, expansion typically only occurs when the premutation is inherited from the mother.  When a couple has a child with fragile X syndrome, we know that the mother is a premutation carrier as the premutation typically only expands to the full mutation when inherited from the mother. Because mom inherited the premutation from one of her parents, her siblings and cousins are also at risk for being premutation carriers and having children with fragile X syndrome. Testing mom's parents to determine who she inherited the premutation from can tell us which side of her family is at risk for having children with fragile X syndrome.  With dads, it's a little trickier. Dads can have either the normal repeat length (10-40 repeats) or be premutation carriers themselves. The only way to determine this is through DNA testing. In general, testing is not performed unless there is a history of fragile X in his family. If testing is performed and dad is found to be a premutation carrier, his siblings and cousins are at risk for having children with fragile X syndrome.   7. If I am a premutation carrier, am I at risk for anything? Unlike many genetic disorders, being a carrier does put you at an increased risk for certain medical problems.  Females who are premutation carriers are at risk for premature menopause, or loss of menses before the age of 40. Premature menopause occurs at a rate of approximately 6% of females in the general population. With female fragile X premutation carriers, this rate increases to about 20%. Even when occurring after age 40, the age of onset for menopause on average can occur 6-8 years earlier in women who are fragile X premutation carriers. This can be a serious concern if you are in your 30s and are planning to have another child. If you are currently trying to have a child and are having infertility problems, premature menopause could be a cause. In addition, some of the options for reducing your risk of having another child with fragile X syndrome, such as IVF with PGD, may be a less viable option due to premature menopause. If you are a premutation carrier, you should discuss this risk with your primary care physician and OB/GYN, especially if you are planning on having more children.  Males who are premutation carriers are at risk for a condition known as fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS is characterized by progressively severe intention tremor and difficulty with walking and balance. It can also be associated with dementia characterized by memory loss, trouble formulating plans, difficulty with focusing attention, and difficulty knowing what's appropriate or not. Other neurological findings may also be present. FXTAS appears to affect primarily older premutation carrier males with signs appearing in their 50s to 60s. Recent research has also shown that some premutation carrier females may also develop FXTAS, but not as often as premutation carrier males.   8. I want more children. Is there any way to tell whether I will have another child with fragile X syndrome? By having a child with fragile X syndrome, you are at an increased risk of having a 2nd child with the condition. However, prenatal diagnosis is available. Either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10-12 weeks gestation or amniocentesis at 14-18 weeks gestation can be performed. With CVS, there is a preliminary result available in the first trimester although the confirmatory testing for a final result is often not available until the second trimester. In addition, certain results from CVS analysis can sometimes be difficult to interpret. For further details about why these issues can occur, talk to your genetic counselor. With amniocentesis, results are generally available approximately 4 weeks after the procedure is performed. Even with diagnosis of a full mutation in either a male or female, it is not possible to determine what difficulties he or she may have.  Other risk reducing options are available, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), IVF with egg donor, and adoption. As with CVS, results from PGD can sometimes be difficult to interpret and may require confirmatory testing. The decision to follow through with one of these options is a very personal one, and what may be right for one couple is not right for another. There is no right answer. These options can be further discussed with your doctor or genetic counselor.   Potential Medical Problems    9. My child has/had feeding problems. Is this going to be a lifelong problem? Usually, feeding problems and vomiting improve with age. If feeding problems are severe, a study called an esophageal pH probe study may be done to look for reflux. A barium swallow study may be performed to assess reflux treatment. Treatment for reflux generally involves thickening feedings and placing your child in an upright position after meals. Medication may also be needed.   10. I've heard that children and adults with fragile X syndrome may have significant behavior issues. What can be done to manage behaviors? It's true that many individuals with fragile X syndrome have behavior issues. Hyperactivity is common in childhood, but does tend to improve in adolescence and adulthood. Social anxiety is also common, and may be particularly severe in females with fragile X syndrome. Anxiety may lead to outbursts of aggression, particularly in males. Another concern of parents is their child's obsessive and compulsive behavior. This may manifest itself in repetitive behavior.  Usually, medications can be used to treat these behaviors. This combined with other treatment modalities, including counseling and sensory integration therapy, can be very helpful for those who have significant behavior problems. In addition, treatments specific for behaviors can be helpful. For example, limiting excessive sensory stimulation whenever possible may prevent aggressive outbursts and social anxiety. Working with a psychologist can help children who have tantrums, oppositional behavior, or severe hyperactivity.   11. My child suffers from seizures. Is this common in fragile X syndrome? Seizures occur in approximately 20% of individuals with fragile X syndrome and usually present early in childhood. The types of seizures generally seen in individuals with fragile X syndrome generally respond well to anti-seizure medication. The seizures tend to resolve by adolescence, but may continue into adulthood.  If you believe your child is having seizures, an appointment with a neurologist should be scheduled as soon as possible. The neurologist may perform an EEG to determine what kind of seizures your child is having and will discuss a treatment plan with you.   12. My child has been referred to an ophthalmologist, but he doesn't seem to have any vision problems. In about 25-55% of individuals with fragile X syndrome have eye problems, including strabismus (the inability to focus both eyes on an object because of muscle weakness in one eye), hyperopia (far-sightedness), and astigmatism. Corrective lenses are generally used to treat far-sightedness and astigmatism. Treatment for strabismus often involves patching, eye exercises, or lenses to strengthen the weak eye. If none of these work, surgery may be required.   13. I finally got my daughter potty trained, but she is still wetting herself at night. She gets upset when she wakes up. What can I do? This along with delays in potty training are frequent problems in children with fragile X syndrome. Some behavioral tactics, such as decreasing fluids after dinner, going to the bathroom before bedtime, and waking your child to go to the bathroom when you go to bed, may help to decrease the frequency of bed-wetting. Your doctor may also be able to prescribe medications that help.   14. I read that people with fragile X syndrome have connective tissue problems. What does this mean? Connective tissue connects and supports other tissues and includes cartilage, blood, and bone. We're not entirely sure why individuals with fragile X syndrome have connective tissue problems. Many of these problems are minor, such as loose, flexible (or hyperextensible) joints. Flat feet are also common in children with fragile X syndrome. Joint hyperextensibility tends to improve with age. Most of the time, having loose, flexible joints does not cause a problem and requires no treatment. Occasionally, however, a joint may be dislocated and will require treatment.   15. My son with fragile X syndrome is 12 years old. Some of the boys his age at school are starting to go through puberty. Will he go through puberty normally? Your son should go through puberty normally. One thing to be aware of is that in 80-90% of males with fragile X syndrome have what is called macroorchidism, or large testicles. This generally does not cause any complications and does not require any intervention. However, because males with fragile X may have connective tissue problems, having large testicles may predispose them to inguinal hernias. Inguinal hernias can occur during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.   16. My daughter appears to be starting puberty. What should I expect? As with boys, girls seem to go through puberty normally. It is important to address your daughter's emotional status before and during her period as girls with fragile X syndrome are prone to mood swings and anxiety, particularly during times of hormonal change (such as puberty and her period).  There have been a number of reports about girls having precocious puberty. Girls who present with features of precocious puberty should see an endocrinologist who may use hormone treatment to stop the progression.   17. Will my child be able to have children? Yes. Both males and females with fragile X syndrome are fertile. Girls with fragile X syndrome are at risk for having children who also have fragile X syndrome. Boys with fragile X syndrome are premutation carriers, even though they themselves have the full mutation. Therefore, all of their daughters will be premutation carriers.   18. Our oldest son was recently diagnosed with fragile X syndrome. At the time, the doctor said something could be wrong with his heart. Is this something serious? About 50% of adults with fragile X syndrome, including females, have something called mitral valve prolapse (MVP). This means that one of the heart valves, the mitral valve, is leaky. If MVP is severe or associated with mitral regurgitation (meaning the blood goes back to the chamber where it came from), prophylactic antibiotics for surgical or dental procedures may be recommended.  In addition to MVP, many adults with fragile X syndrome have high blood pressure. This can be treated using blood pressure medications.   19. I'm only 38 years old and I'm already starting menopause. My gynecologist says it may be because I'm a fragile X premutation carrier. Is she right? It is true that being a premutation carrier puts you at higher risk for premature menopause. Approximately 20% of females who are fragile X premutation carriers experience premature menopause (loss of menses before age 40), as opposed to 6% in the general population. Interestingly enough, full mutation carriers (or girls with fragile X syndrome) are not at a higher risk for fragile X syndrome. Even when occurring after age 40, the age of onset for menopause in premutation carriers can occur 6-8 years earlier than in women in the general population.   20. My father is starting to develop a tremor which the doctors think could be Parkinson's disease. I read somewhere that male fragile X premutation carriers are at risk for neurological problems. Is Parkinson's one of them? Older males who are fragile X premutation carriers are indeed at risk for a combination of neurological problems called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS is characterized by progressively severe intention tremor and difficulty with walking and balance. It can also be associated with dementia characterized by memory loss, trouble formulating plans, difficulty with focusing attention, and difficulty knowing what's appropriate or not. Signs of FXTAS start appearing when male premutation carriers are in their 50s and 60s. About 75% of premutation carrier men will show signs of FXTAS by their 80s.
