Aikea        December 2013    edited December 2013   in Herpes question(s)      Hi there I'm completely new here. Was feeling really down after being single for the first time while having this. Reading the information on here has made me feel so much more positive about this. So thank you so much everyone. My question is.. If its a 4% chance for a male to catch this with unprotected sex with a herpes + person then what is the percentage of anybody catching it from anyone? And same with using a condom..? Hope that makes sense.       Comments          adrial        December 2013       Hi Aikea! Welcome to the Herpes Opportunity forums! Good to have you. All the percentages of passing herpes are gone over in detail on this handout here: http://bit.ly/h-opp-disclosure-handout The reason there is 2.5x greater chances of females getting herpes than for males is because a vagina has more mucous membrane than a penis. It's easier to transmit herpes when there is easier access to the person's body since herpes is passed from skin-to-skin contact. Mucous membrane is way more permeable to the virus than the skin.

I meant what is the chance of the average person catching herpes in general - say from someone who didn't know they had it etc. I mean like if someone went out and had a one night stand.              adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       I'm still unclear on your question.  Did you have a one night stand and are worrying that you might have passed herpes to him? What your asking would still carry the same percentages that are on that handout whether it's sex via one night stand or in a relationship or if the person knows they have it or not. I do believe the chances of passing herpes drops considerably when you know your body well because you can avoid sex during herpes outbreaks and when you feel an outbreak might be coming on. But as far as when there isn't an active outbreak, the percentages break down to what's on that handout. Those percentages are aggregates of all the people who have gotten herpes vs all the people who haven't. They're averages. You can't quite say to someone "You're going to get 4% herpes." Either they're going to get herpes or not, but the chances of them getting herpes are much smaller than the chances of them getting herpes, especially when you take basic precautions and are safe and knowledgeable about your prodrome symptoms. Was that more clear?              Aikea        December 2013       Lol ok hmm... What I think I mean is. What is the chance/percentage of anyone catching herpes?               adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       Have you ever seen the "Who's on first?" sketch? I feel like that's what we're playing now.  To answer your question directly: It depends. The chance of anyone catching herpes depends on if they are a man/woman, whether the person with herpes knows they have herpes or not, whether a condom is used or not, whether suppressive medication is used or not and other factors. The full range in all of that falls between roughly a 1-10% chance of anyone catching herpes at any given time.              WCSDancer2010        December 2013       I would add that a lowered immune system and rough sex (which could cause small tears to form an make it easier for the virus to get in) would put the numbers at the higher end too.

Your right thats us Thanks for answering my questions And answers to questions I didnt ask! By the way I just disclosed and he was really lovely about it.   Whew!              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       YAY Aikea! Another success story               abc123        January 2014       Love the "Who's On First" reference....thanks for asking/answering these questions... And making it funny, too!              Mermaid2349        January 2014       WCSDancer2010, I apologize in advance for hijacking this post, but something you said was exactly what I came to the forum today looking for. Just disclosed, and like Aikea he was great about everything. My question is this, he takes medication that has the side effect of lowering his immune system. And I am wondering what that means in terms of risks to him. I do not want to proceed without doing a bit of research, asking my doctor and the folks on here (who are a lot more knowledgeable than a lot of MD's about the topic) so that he can make an informed choice. I want to keep him safe and herpes free!!! Thanks everyone! Mermaid2349              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       Well, I'm not a doctor so I can't really advise on that. Really, he should talk to HIS doctor about what his risks are. There are many reasons people are on those drugs and some might be more likely to have issues with getting Herpes than others. All we can tell you here is with supressant meds and a condom you can get his risks down to no more than 2% .... and really, I think if you are really, really in tune with your body, perhaps more..... The GOOD thing is that you will have a great excuse to find all kinds of wonderful ways to pleasure each other when you *might* be having an OB that you might not explore otherwise.

Most people with the virus don’t have symptoms. Even without signs of the disease, herpes can still be spread to sex partners.

Genital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are called herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  What is oral herpes?  Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1 and can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes were infected during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.  Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?  Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can be spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex . This is why some cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-1.  How common is genital herpes?  Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.  How is genital herpes spread?  You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.  If you do not have herpes, you can get infected if you come into contact with the herpes virus in:   A herpes sore;  Saliva (if your partner has an oral herpes infection) or genital secretions (if your partner has a genital herpes infection);  Skin in the oral area if your partner has an oral herpes infection, or skin in the genital area if your partner has a genital herpes infection.   You can get herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a sex partner who has oral herpes.  You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools, or from touching objects around you such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have additional questions about how herpes is spread, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.    How can I reduce my risk of getting genital herpes?  The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:   Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results);  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.   Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that are covered by a latex condom. Also, herpes virus can be released (shed) from areas of the skin that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.  If you are in a relationship with a person known to have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting genital herpes if:   Your partner takes an anti-herpes medication every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her doctor.  You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., when your partner is having an outbreak).    I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?  If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is very important for you to go to prenatal care visits. Tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, or have been diagnosed with, genital herpes. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to genital herpes. There is some research that suggests that genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage, or could make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early.  Herpes infection can be passed from you to your unborn child before birth but is more commonly passed to your infant during delivery. This can lead to a potentially deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes at the time of delivery. At the time of delivery, your doctor should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.  How do I know if I have genital herpes?  Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. These symptoms are sometimes called “having an outbreak.” The first time someone has an outbreak they may also have flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, or swollen glands.  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they are infected with HSV-2. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection stays in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.  You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD. STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when urinating, or (for women) bleeding between periods.  How will my doctor know if I have herpes?  Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs.  Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or how long you have been infected.  Can herpes be cured?  There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).  What happens if I don’t get treated?  Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.  If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading your infection.  If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your developing fetus, or newborn baby. See “ I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby? ” above for information about this.  Can I still have sex if I have herpes?  If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) and let him or her know that you do and the risk involved. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.  You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your overall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care provider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while herpes is not curable, it can be managed with medication. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) for herpes can also lower your risk of spreading genital herpes to your sex partner. Be sure to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important to understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs .  What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?  Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, having genital herpes increases the number of CD4 cells (the cells that HIV targets for entry into the body) found in the lining of the genitals. When a person has both HIV and genital herpes, the chances are higher that HIV will be spread to an HIV-uninfected sex partner during sexual contact with their partner’s mouth, vagina, or rectum.

June 17, 2009 12:24 PM   Subscribe  What are my chances of contracting herpes?   I am moving out of the country in a couple weeks. I have reignited a romance with a former flame. He has genital herpes.  I knew about this before we slept together, and we always used condoms and avoided sex if he had an outbreak. I never contracted herpes while I was with him (I had a blood test after we broke up.)  We're not in any kind of relationship, we just have a special connection. I want to have some great memories and good times with him before I leave.  Is it too much of a risk to have sex, assuming we use a condom and he isn't having an outbreak? The information on the internet seems to be all over the map. One nurse I talked to seemed to think the risk was very minimal, a doctor told me she didn't think it was worth the risk.  Would anti-viral drugs be a possibility?  I'm not sure how to talk to him about this, given that we had sex before and I was fine with it.  I'm just trying to measure the risk before I make a decision. Thanks!  posted by anonymous to Health & Fitness (5 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite       I recently talked to my doctor about this, and she said the risk is pretty low (low, single percentage points, if even) if you do everything right (condoms, anti-virals, avoidance at the right times). You're more at risk as a girl, but condoms more effectively protect you as a female, too. Purely anecdotal, but I have a friend with HSV who was married for 10 years and had two long-term relationships and has never passed it to a partner. But really, it's about your own personal comfort with the risk, right? posted by lunalaguna at 12:35 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]  Wikipedia : On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios—meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free—by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. So starting at a 10% risk (annual), if you assume the studied group had sex 100 times / year, the per-incidence trasmission risk would be 1 in 950 . Slap on a condom and have him down some antivirals and you'd looking at a ~1 in 4,000 risk. If you only care about symptomatic infections, then it's 1 in 8,000 per encounter . posted by 1VF5 at 1:08 PM on June 17, 2009  Here is a Savage Love question that is basically the same, with a reversal of genders.  I would recommend this piece of advice , for peace of mind: "Wash thoroughly with soap and water after sex; virii aren't very strong. Soap and hot water kill and/or wash away the herpes virus if it hasn't already made it through a break in your skin. "  Keep in mind that having careful sex with someone who you know the risks about is much safer than having less safe sex with a perfect stranger who could just as easily have something. If you picked up a random guy in the bar, you could be taking the exact same risk. But since you know from the start your partner has herpes, you'll be sure to take the precautions to prevent you from getting it.  Happy fuckin'! posted by Juliet Banana at 1:45 PM on June 17, 2009  Keep in mind that the virus can get into you a lot more easily if you have any breaks in your skin.  Regardless of whether he has any open sores, if you've got (for example) a nick or ingrown hair from bikini line maintenance, or tiny abrasions from the friction of sex, the virus can more easily get into your system.  So keep an eye on your own parts, and be gentle to them.  Use plenty of lube. posted by vytae at 2:09 PM on June 17, 2009  Juliet Banana has it, but obviously be aware that more vigorous washing or any kind of exfoliation is worse, not better. The most important thing is to avoid abrasions or any breaking of the skin. If your partner is not already on an anti-viral, eg Valtrex, daily therapy for him can reduce the odds of spreading the virus (even if he's already asymptomatic). posted by telegraph at 2:54 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]   « Older Recomend some fund raising software.   |   Am I doomed to be a doormat forever?

Can someone infected with herpes continue to have sex without giving it to their partner? Do cold sores, which are almost always caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), protect against genital herpes caused by herpes simplex virus type 2? Can someone be infected with both types of herpes viruses?  Those are among the questions recently posed by readers of the Consults blog. Dr. Peter Leone, an expert on sexually transmitted diseases and associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and Public Health, responds.  What’s My Risk of Spreading Herpes?  Q.  I found out that I have herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) about a month and a half ago. My primary partner, who is male, has been tested twice since then, and both results have been negative. We were fluid-bonded [exposed to each other’s bodily fluids] and had plenty of unprotected sex between my most recent negative result and last month’s positive one. What are the rates of transmission in a serologically discordant couple where the female partner has HSV-2?  I’ve read that it’s:   4 percent in couples who don’t use barriers but avoid sex during outbreaks, and where the woman is not on antiviral suppressive therapy.  2 percent in couples who use condoms and no antivirals.  1 percent in couples who use both condoms and daily antivirals.   Is this accurate? It’s really hard to find comprehensive information on the Internet that gives hard scientific data on rates of transmission.  Stella, Chicago  A.  Dr. Peter Leone responds:  Transmission of HSV-2 to an uninfected partner depends on many different factors, and it is difficult to give precise figures. Studies involving discordant couples, in which one partner has HSV-2 and the other does not, introduce various biases. Discordant couples, for example, have not transmitted the virus between them and are encouraged to use condoms and take other preventive measures. Given these caveats, here’s what we can say:   Women are more likely to acquire HSV-2 from an infected male partner then men are from women. On average, the risk for women acquiring HSV-2 sexually from an infected partner is about 10 percent per year, though there is a large range — from 7 percent to 31 percent — in different studies.  For uninfected men, the risk of sexually acquiring HSV-2 from an infected woman is about 4 percent per year.  Having HSV-1 infection may lower the risk of acquiring HSV-2 sexually, but studies on this provide conflicting results.  Condoms reduce the risk of transmission by about 30 percent, and daily suppressive therapy reduces the risk of transmission by about 48 percent, studies show. Using condoms and taking daily suppressive therapy reduces the risk even further than either measure alone, though studies were not large enough to provide reliable numbers.  Unfortunately, there is no available data on the rate of transmission for same-sex couples.   HSV-2 transmission is more dependent on genitals than gender. What I mean by this is that contact by the penis with either the vagina or rectum is where the greatest risk of transmission occurs. Oral sex is more of an issue for HSV-1 transmission — from mouth to genitals, and indeed, HSV-1 is a fast-growing cause of genital herpes.  Oral sex, though, is not much of a risk for HSV-2, since HSV-2 oral infection is rare and shedding of HSV-2 from the mouth is extremely low.  Can You Be Infected With Both Types of Herpes?  Q.  Can a person have both HSV-1 and HSV-2? And what would it do to your chances of contracting H.I.V.? Or hepatitis C, for that matter?  cardo, Chico, Calif.  A.  Dr. Peter Leone responds:  Yes. About 10 percent of adults in the United States have both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Of those with HSV-2, about 40 percent are co-infected with HSV-1.  HSV-2 increases the risk for H.I.V. acquisition. Someone infected with HSV-2 has two to five times greater risk of acquiring H.I.V. through sexual intercourse compared with someone who is not infected with HSV-2. HSV-1 does not increase the risk of H.I.V.  Your question about whether herpes increases the risk of contracting hepatitis C is an interesting one. The biggest risk for hepatitis C is through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But hepatitis C can also be sexually transmitted, and it appears that the risk may be increased in women and in men who have sex with men who are also infected with HSV-2.  Do Cold Sores Protect Against Genital Herpes?  Q.  As a kid, I had oral herpes (painful sores on inside of mouth, etc.), and then many years later I dated a girl for two years who had herpes, and I never caught it (though we often, though not always, used condoms). I’m long since married now, but I’ve always wondered, does having had oral herpes make one immune to contracting genital herpes?  Nathan, NYC  A.  Dr. Peter Leone responds:  Cold sores are almost always – 98 percent of the time — caused by HSV-1. Having HSV-1 infection may make it more difficult to acquire HSV-2 infection, but, at best, offers only partial immunity.  If someone with HSV-1 acquires HSV-2, he or she is likely to have a mild first outbreak of HSV-2 — or there may not be any symptoms at all. Nearly 40 percent of individuals infected with HSV-2 are also infected with HSV-1. Maybe you don’t have HSV-2 infection, but the only way to know for sure is to get a blood test for HSV-2.

Genital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are called herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  What is oral herpes?  Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1 and can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes were infected during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.  Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?  Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can be spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex . This is why some cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-1.  How common is genital herpes?  Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.  How is genital herpes spread?  You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.  If you do not have herpes, you can get infected if you come into contact with the herpes virus in:   A herpes sore;  Saliva (if your partner has an oral herpes infection) or genital secretions (if your partner has a genital herpes infection);  Skin in the oral area if your partner has an oral herpes infection, or skin in the genital area if your partner has a genital herpes infection.   You can get herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a sex partner who has oral herpes.  You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools, or from touching objects around you such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have additional questions about how herpes is spread, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.    How can I reduce my risk of getting genital herpes?  The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:   Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results);  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.   Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that are covered by a latex condom. Also, herpes virus can be released (shed) from areas of the skin that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.  If you are in a relationship with a person known to have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting genital herpes if:   Your partner takes an anti-herpes medication every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her doctor.  You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., when your partner is having an outbreak).    I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?  If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is very important for you to go to prenatal care visits. Tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, or have been diagnosed with, genital herpes. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to genital herpes. There is some research that suggests that genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage, or could make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early.  Herpes infection can be passed from you to your unborn child before birth but is more commonly passed to your infant during delivery. This can lead to a potentially deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes at the time of delivery. At the time of delivery, your doctor should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.  How do I know if I have genital herpes?  Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. These symptoms are sometimes called “having an outbreak.” The first time someone has an outbreak they may also have flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, or swollen glands.  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they are infected with HSV-2. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection stays in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.  You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD. STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when urinating, or (for women) bleeding between periods.  How will my doctor know if I have herpes?  Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs.  Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or how long you have been infected.  Can herpes be cured?  There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).  What happens if I don’t get treated?  Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.  If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading your infection.  If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your developing fetus, or newborn baby. See “ I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby? ” above for information about this.  Can I still have sex if I have herpes?  If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) and let him or her know that you do and the risk involved. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.  You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your overall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care provider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while herpes is not curable, it can be managed with medication. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) for herpes can also lower your risk of spreading genital herpes to your sex partner. Be sure to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important to understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs .  What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?  Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, having genital herpes increases the number of CD4 cells (the cells that HIV targets for entry into the body) found in the lining of the genitals. When a person has both HIV and genital herpes, the chances are higher that HIV will be spread to an HIV-uninfected sex partner during sexual contact with their partner’s mouth, vagina, or rectum.

By  Alicia Coffman   On 5/12/08 at 12:28 PM   Share         Culture Cold sores--they always seem to pop up when you have a big interview, first date or important event. You know what they look like and what a pain they can be, but are they a sexually transmitted disease? According Dr. Craig Austin, a dermatologist in New York City, cold sores usually aren't a sexually transmitted disease (STD). They are caused by the herpes simplex virus. There are two kinds of herpes virus: HSV-1, which is usually not an STD and occurs on the lip, and HSV-2, which usually causes herpes genitalis, which is essentially an STD in the genital area. Both viruses can be transmitted by saliva, body secretions or oral sex. If you contract either kind of herpes you will always have the virus because the cold sore lives in the sensory nerve and stays dormant in the nerve until outbreaks occur. Some people only get one cold sore in their lives and may not realize they are carrying a latent form of the virus. Even if you don't have a visible cold sore, there's a chance you can still transmit the virus through your saliva or via oral sex, says Dr. Barry Goldman, the chief of dermatology at New York Downtown Hospital. (An outbreak of HSV-1 in the genital area becomes a form of genital herpes.) So, what are the triggers for those pesky cold sores? Emotional stress, the flu, the common cold, dental work and UVB rays from sunlight can all prompt the sore to the surface, said Dr. Ofer M. Wellisch,  a clinical researcher in New York City. (When they appear after a day in the sun or after the flu, they are sometimes called "sun blisters" or "fever blisters," but they are caused by the herpes virus.)

Apply sunblock to the face. 2. Use lip-balm with SPF. 3. Take time out to do stress-reducing activities like meditation , physical activity or getting a neck message. 4. Avoid kissing anyone with a cold sore. 5. Avoid sharing items like toothbrushes, lip-balm or towels. 6. Always remember to wash your hands if you suspect you've had contact with a cold sore.

What You Need to Know About Herpes Transmission Medically reviewed by Alana Biggers, MD on  April 13, 2017 — Written by Corey Whelan HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral transmission Symptoms Prevention Overview  Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) is one of two types of the herpes virus and is rarely transmitted orally. However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. People with compromised immune systems in particular may be at risk.  HSV2 is a sexually transmitted virus that causes sores and blisters known as herpes lesions. In order to be infected with HSV2, there has to be skin-to-skin contact between an infected person and a partner. HSV2 is not transmitted through semen.  Once HSV2 enters the body, it travels through the nervous system to the spinal nerves, where it typically comes to rest in the sacral ganglia, a cluster of nerve tissue located near the base of the spine. After the initial infection, HSV2 lies dormant in your nerves. When it becomes activated, a process known as viral shedding occurs. Viral shedding is when the virus replicates. Viral shedding may cause a herpes outbreak and symptoms such as herpes lesions. These usually occur in the genitals or rectum. However, it’s also possible for the virus to be activated and for no visible symptoms to occur.  HSV2 can be asymptomatic, which means it causes no apparent symptoms. That’s why it’s important to use protection during sexual activity and to get tested regularly by a doctor if you are sexually active. You can still transmit the virus to a partner even if you don’t have any apparent symptoms.  HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral
transmission  The other commonly transmitted strain of the herpes simplex virus , HSV1, typically results in oral herpes, or cold sores around the mouth. This form of HSV is more readily transmitted via oral contact, such as kissing, than through genital contact. HSV1 can be transmitted through both giving and receiving oral sex. It can cause both mouth and genital sores. You can also get HSV1 through vaginal and anal intercourse, and through the use of sex toys.  Unlike HSV2, which usually lies dormant between outbreaks at the base of the spine, HSV1’s latency periods are typically spent in nerve endings near the ear. That is why it is more likely to cause oral herpes than genital herpes.  HSV1 and HSV2 are genetically similar to each other. For this reason, having one form of the virus sometimes reduces risk of contracting the other form. This is because your body actively produces antibodies to fight the virus once you have it. However, it is possible to contract both forms.  Symptoms Symptoms to look out
for  HSV1 and HSV2 can both have no symptoms or very mild symptoms that you might not notice. Not having symptoms does not mean you do not have the virus.  If you do have symptoms of HSV1, they may include:  a tingling sensation, itching, or pain, anywhere in the genital area or around the mouth one or more small, white blisters that may become oozy, or bloody one or more small, red bumps or irritated-looking skin  It is important to see a doctor if you suspect you have contracted HSV1 or HSV2. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help reduce the number and severity of your outbreaks.  Prevention How to prevent HSV transmission  HSV2 can often be prevented with some proactive strategies. These include:  Prevention tips Always use a condom during any type of sexual activity. Avoid having sex during herpes outbreaks, but be aware that people with herpes may have no symptoms and still transmit the virus. Maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with an infection-free person. Communicate with your sexual partner or partners if you have HSV, and ask if they have it themselves. Abstaining from all forms of sexual activity or reducing the number of sexual partners you have also reduces risk.

HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes (which can include symptoms known as “cold sores”), but can also cause genital herpes.  HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital herpes.  Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are lifelong.  An estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) have HSV-1 infection globally.  An estimated 417 million people aged 15-49 (11%) worldwide have HSV-2 infection.  Most oral and genital herpes infections are asymptomatic.  Symptoms of herpes include painful blisters or ulcers at the site of infection.  Herpes infections are most contagious when symptoms are present but can still be transmitted to others in the absence of symptoms.  Infection with HSV-2 increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection.    Introduction   Infection with the herpes simplex virus, commonly known as herpes, can be due to either herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral to oral contact to cause infection in or around the mouth (oral herpes). HSV-2 is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, causing infection in the genital or anal area (genital herpes). However, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes.   Both oral herpes infections and genital herpes infections are mostly asymptomatic but can cause mild symptoms or painful blisters or ulcers at the site of infection.   Herpes simplex virus - type 1 (HSV-1)  Herpes simplex virus - type 2 (HSV-2)   Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)   HSV-1 is a highly contagious infection, which is common and endemic throughout the world. Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood, and infection is lifelong. The vast majority of HSV-1 infections are oral herpes (infections in or around the mouth, sometimes called orolabial, oral-labial or oral-facial herpes), but a proportion of HSV-1 infections are genital herpes (infections in the genital or anal area).  Scope of the problem   In 2012, an estimated 3.7 billion people under the age of 50, or 67% of the population, had HSV-1 infection. Estimated prevalence of the infection was highest in Africa (87%) and lowest in the Americas (40-50%).   With respect to genital HSV-1 infection, 140 million people aged 15-49-years were estimated to have genital HSV-1 infection worldwide in 2012, but prevalence varied substantially by region. Most genital HSV-1 infections are estimated to occur in the Americas, Europe and Western Pacific, where HSV-1 continues to be acquired well into adulthood. In other regions, for example in Africa, most HSV-1 infections are acquired in childhood, before the age of sexual debut.  Signs and symptoms   Oral herpes infection is mostly asymptomatic, and the majority of people with HSV-1 infection are unaware they are infected. Symptoms of oral herpes include painful blisters or open sores called ulcers in or around the mouth. Sores on the lips are commonly referred to as “cold sores.” Infected persons will often experience a tingling, itching or burning sensation around their mouth, before the appearance of sores. After initial infection, the blisters or ulcers can periodically recur. The frequency of recurrences varies from person to person.   Genital herpes caused by HSV-1 can be asymptomatic or can have mild symptoms that go unrecognized. When symptoms do occur, genital herpes is characterised by 1 or more genital or anal blisters or ulcers. After an initial genital herpes episode, which may be severe, symptoms may recur, but genital herpes caused by HSV-1 often does not recur frequently.  Transmission   HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes infection, via contact with the HSV-1 virus in sores, saliva, and surfaces in or around the mouth. However, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes.   HSV-1 can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal and when there are no symptoms present. However, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores.   Individuals who already have HSV-1 oral herpes infection are unlikely to be subsequently infected with HSV-1 in the genital area.   In rare circumstances, HSV-1 infection can be transmitted from a mother with genital HSV-1 infection to her infant during delivery.  Possible complications  Severe disease   In immunocompromised people, such as those with advanced HIV infection, HSV-1 can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences. Rarely, HSV-1 infection can also lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis or keratitis (eye infection).  Neonatal herpes   Neonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV in the genital tract during delivery. This is a rare condition, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100,000 births globally, but can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV infection for the first time in late pregnancy. Women who have genital herpes before they become pregnant are at very low risk of transmitting HSV to their infants.  Psychosocial impact   Recurrent symptoms of oral herpes may be uncomfortable and can lead to some social stigma and psychological distress. With genital herpes, these factors can have an important impact on quality of life and sexual relationships. However, in time, most people with either kind of herpes adjust to living with the infection.  Treatment   Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir, are the most effective medications available for people infected with HSV. These can help to reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms, but cannot cure the infection.    WHO guidelines for the treatment of Genital Herpes Simplex Virus    Prevention   HSV-1 is most contagious during an outbreak of symptomatic oral herpes, but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible. People with active symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others and sharing objects that have contact with saliva. They should also abstain from oral sex, to avoid transmitting herpes to the genitals of a sexual partner. Individuals with symptoms of genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity whilst experiencing any of the symptoms.   People who already have HSV-1 infection are not at risk of getting it again, but they are still at risk of acquiring herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) genital infection (see below).   The consistent and correct use of condoms can help to prevent the spread of genital herpes. However, condoms can only reduce the risk of infection, as outbreaks of genital herpes can occur in areas not covered by a condom.   Pregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers. Preventing acquisition of a new genital herpes infection is particularly important for women in late pregnancy, as this is when the risk for neonatal herpes is greatest.   Additional research is underway to develop more effective prevention methods against HSV infection, such as vaccines. Several candidate HSV vaccines are currently being studied.  Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)   HSV-2 infection is widespread throughout the world and is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, causing genital herpes. HSV-2 is the main cause of genital herpes, which can also be caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Infection with HSV-2 is lifelong and incurable.  Scope of the problem   Genital herpes caused by HSV-2 is a global issue, and an estimated 417 million people worldwide were living with the infection in 2012. Prevalence of HSV-2 infection was estimated to be highest in Africa (31.5%), followed by the Americas (14.4%). It was also shown to increase with age, though the highest numbers of people newly-infected were adolescents.   More women are infected with HSV-2 than men; in 2012 it was estimated that 267 million women and 150 million men were living with the infection. This is because sexual transmission of HSV is more efficient from men to women than from women to men.  Signs and symptoms   Genital herpes infections often have no symptoms, or mild symptoms that go unrecognised. Most infected people are unaware that they have the infection. Typically, about 10-20% of people with HSV-2 infection report a prior diagnosis of genital herpes.   When symptoms do occur, genital herpes is characterised by one or more genital or anal blisters or open sores called ulcers. In addition to genital ulcers, symptoms of new genital herpes infections often include fever, body aches, and swollen lymph nodes.   After an initial genital herpes infection with HSV-2, recurrent symptoms are common but often less severe than the first outbreak. The frequency of outbreaks tends to decrease over time. People infected with HSV-2 may experience sensations of mild tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips, and buttocks before the occurrence of genital ulcers.  Transmission   HSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex, through contact with genital surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted from skin in the genital or anal area that looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.   In rare circumstances, HSV-2 infection can be transmitted from a mother to her infant during delivery.  Possible complications  HSV-2 and HIV   HSV-2 and HIV have been shown to influence each other. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring a new HIV infection by approximately three-fold. In addition, people with both HIV and HSV-2 infection are more likely to spread HIV to others. HSV-2 is amongst the most common infections in people living with HIV, occurring in 60-90% of HIV-infected persons.   Infection with HSV-2 in people living with HIV (and other immunocompromised individuals) often has a more severe presentation and more frequent recurrences. In advanced HIV disease, HSV-2 can lead to more serious, but rare, complications such as meningoencephalitis, esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinal necrosis, or disseminated infection.  Neonatal herpes   Neonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV in the genital tract during delivery. This is a rare condition, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100,000 births globally, but can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV infection for the first time in late pregnancy. Women who have genital herpes before they become pregnant are at very low risk of transmitting HSV to their infants.  Psychosocial impact   Recurrent symptoms of genital herpes may be painful and the infection can lead to social stigma and psychological distress. These factors can have an important impact on quality of life and sexual relationships. However, in time, most people with herpes adjust to living with the infection.  Treatment   Antivirals, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are the most effective medications available for people infected with HSV. These can help to reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms, but cannot cure the infection.    WHO guidelines for the treatment of Genital Herpes Simplex Virus    Prevention   Individuals with genital HSV infection should abstain from sexual activity whilst experiencing symptoms of genital herpes. HSV-2 is most contagious during an outbreak of sores, but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible.   The consistent and correct use of condoms can help reduce the risk of spreading genital herpes. However, condoms only provide partial protection, as HSV can be found in areas not covered by a condom. Medical male circumcision can provide men life-long partial protection against HSV-2, in addition to HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).   Pregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers. Preventing acquisition of a new genital herpes infection is particularly important for women in late pregnancy, as this is when the risk for neonatal herpes is greatest.   Additional research is underway to develop more effective prevention methods against HSV infection, such as vaccines or topical microbicides (compounds which can be applied inside the vagina or rectum to protect against sexually transmitted infections).  WHO response to herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2)   WHO and partners are working to accelerate research to develop new strategies for prevention and control of genital and neonatal HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. Such research includes the development of HSV vaccines and topical microbicides. Several candidate vaccines and microbicides are currently being studied.

SHARE TWEET Cindy Kuzma Feb 15 2017, 3:00pm Jonathan Knowles/Getty Images Herpes infects more people worldwide than any other sexually transmitted infection—and it spreads through a simple equation: One partner has the virus. Another partner doesn't. Any sexual contact between the two can infect the uninfected.  Anal, vaginal, oral, fingering—it doesn't matter; you can still share the bug. "It all depends on what's coming into contact with what," says Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist and spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.  The virus most easily enters the body through a break in the skin, Glatt says—say, an abrasion from rough sex, a cut in your mouth, or a sore from another condition. (Having any one STI increases your risk for acquiring a second.) However, herpes can also slip through the body's normal defenses, especially through mucus membranes in the mouth, eyes, genitals, or rectum.  There's no cure for herpes—and though your risk of spreading it tends to decrease over the years, it's still possible for you to infect a partner. Here's what you need to know to avoid sharing more than you bargained for.   Sex Isn't The Only Way to Test Positive If your doc gives you a herpes diagnosis, make sure you're clear on exactly what you have, Glatt says. There are eight types of herpes simplex virus. One type, HSV-2, causes most cases of genital herpes. Another, HSV-1, most often causes cold sores—but perhaps due to all the great oral we're giving and receiving, type 1 is increasingly causing genital infections too.  If you gave every American a blood test, nine out of ten would have some evidence of infection with one of the eight types, Glatt says. But only about one in six has genital herpes .  "Ask: What type of herpes, how did I get it, and is it sexually transmitted?" Glatt says. Your doc should be able to shoot straight with you. If you test positive but the infection doesn't affect your genital area, chances are you were exposed in some other way—say, sucking on the same toy as an infected toddler way back in day care.  If you do have sores on your private parts, ask your doctor to take a swab. He or she can test the fluid from the sores for the virus, rather than just looking for antibodies the way blood tests do, Glatt says.  When those swabs come back positive, it doesn't really matter if you have type 1 or type 2, he says. You have genital herpes—most likely acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. The steps for stopping its spread are the same for both types.   You Can Pass It On Even If You're Not Having an Outbreak Clusters of red, blistery bumps serve as the telltale sign of oral or genital herpes. When you're first infected, they usually show up within two to ten days. The sores may burst, crust over, then heal—only to come back. Recurrent outbreaks are most common during the first year, Glatt says.  The pus that oozes out of these sores contains millions of viruses, says Philip Werthman, a urologist and director of the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine in Los Angeles. "That's the most contagious time during an outbreak, when the blisters pop."  But even when your skin's clear, you're not off the hook. You might still be shedding the virus, Werthman says. Though the counts are smaller—likely in the hundreds instead of millions—herpes can still infect your partner.  In fact, about 70 percent of transmissions occur during asymptomatic periods, says James Whiteside, an obstetrician/gynecologist at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.  Often, this occurs soon before or after an active outbreak. Most people have a tingly, aching, itching, or stinging sensation when they're about to develop sores—a phenomenon experts call "prodrome." If you avoid sex from the moment you feel these symptoms through a couple of weeks after your sores heal, you'll reduce the risk of infecting your partner, Whiteside says.   Condoms Work—To a Point When you're not in the midst of an active outbreak, wrap it up. Consistent condom use reduces your risk of passing along the virus by about 30 percent, according to a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine .  But of course, condoms can break and are prone to user error. Even when operated flawlessly, they're not as effective against herpes as they are against pregnancy, Glatt says. Skin-to-skin contact before the condom goes on, or between uncovered areas, still leaves the uninfected partner vulnerable.   Women Face a Greater Risk Speaking of vulnerable—women's larger expanses of mucus membranes in and around the vagina increase their odds of catching herpes. That's especially true when they have sex with men, who are more likely than women to shed the virus even when they don't have symptoms, Whiteside says.  In fact, rates of transmission from men to women stand at about 10 percent, while women pass herpes to uninfected men only about 4 percent of the time, he says.   You Can Give It To Yourself. Autoinoculation might sound like a scene from the new 50 Shades movie—but in fact, it's a term for the uncommon but possible circumstance of reinfecting yourself with the virus, Werthman says.  Say you have an open sore and you touch it with your hands. If you have a cut or scrape, the virus can re-enter your skin and cause painful blisters called herpetic whitlow on your fingers. If you then touch your eyes, you can also get herpetic keratitis.  You could even infect another person by touching your sores and then shaking hands, Werthman says. So, keep your hands off your junk when you have an active outbreak—or at the very least, wash or sanitize them afterward.   Antiviral Drugs Help Reduce Symptoms If your outbreaks are frequent or severe, your doctor may prescribe medications that suppress the virus and relieve herpes symptoms. This also reduces the chances of spreading the disease. In fact, daily doses of a drug called valacyclovir cut your risk of infecting your partner by about half, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine .  And even more effective options may be on the horizon. In a recent JAMA  study , an experimental drug called pritelivir reduced both the frequency of outbreaks and the number of days the infected person shed the virus. However, it's not yet available here in the United States.  Researchers are also working to develop a vaccine for the condition. Unlike, say, a flu shot that prevents you from catching a virus, this vaccine is given to people who already have genital herpes.  In early studies , three shots over the course of three weeks reduced the number of days in which an infected person shed virus by about half over the course of the year—potentially cutting the odds of transmission, too. However, it could be years before such methods are FDA-approved, Glatt points out. In the meantime, good old monogamy—or condoms—remain your best bet.

Aikea        December 2013    edited December 2013   in Herpes question(s)      Hi there I'm completely new here. Was feeling really down after being single for the first time while having this. Reading the information on here has made me feel so much more positive about this. So thank you so much everyone. My question is.. If its a 4% chance for a male to catch this with unprotected sex with a herpes + person then what is the percentage of anybody catching it from anyone? And same with using a condom..? Hope that makes sense.       Comments          adrial        December 2013       Hi Aikea! Welcome to the Herpes Opportunity forums! Good to have you. All the percentages of passing herpes are gone over in detail on this handout here: http://bit.ly/h-opp-disclosure-handout The reason there is 2.5x greater chances of females getting herpes than for males is because a vagina has more mucous membrane than a penis. It's easier to transmit herpes when there is easier access to the person's body since herpes is passed from skin-to-skin contact. Mucous membrane is way more permeable to the virus than the skin.

Download your free e-book & handouts now .         Aikea        December 2013       Thanks for the reply Adrial. Sorry I wasn't very clear.. I meant what is the chance of the average person catching herpes in general - say from someone who didn't know they had it etc. I mean like if someone went out and had a one night stand.              adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       I'm still unclear on your question.  Did you have a one night stand and are worrying that you might have passed herpes to him? What your asking would still carry the same percentages that are on that handout whether it's sex via one night stand or in a relationship or if the person knows they have it or not. I do believe the chances of passing herpes drops considerably when you know your body well because you can avoid sex during herpes outbreaks and when you feel an outbreak might be coming on. But as far as when there isn't an active outbreak, the percentages break down to what's on that handout. Those percentages are aggregates of all the people who have gotten herpes vs all the people who haven't. They're averages. You can't quite say to someone "You're going to get 4% herpes." Either they're going to get herpes or not, but the chances of them getting herpes are much smaller than the chances of them getting herpes, especially when you take basic precautions and are safe and knowledgeable about your prodrome symptoms. Was that more clear?              Aikea        December 2013       Lol ok hmm... What I think I mean is. What is the chance/percentage of anyone catching herpes?               adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       Have you ever seen the "Who's on first?" sketch? I feel like that's what we're playing now.  To answer your question directly: It depends. The chance of anyone catching herpes depends on if they are a man/woman, whether the person with herpes knows they have herpes or not, whether a condom is used or not, whether suppressive medication is used or not and other factors. The full range in all of that falls between roughly a 1-10% chance of anyone catching herpes at any given time.              WCSDancer2010        December 2013       I would add that a lowered immune system and rough sex (which could cause small tears to form an make it easier for the virus to get in) would put the numbers at the higher end too.

Your right thats us Thanks for answering my questions And answers to questions I didnt ask! By the way I just disclosed and he was really lovely about it.   Whew!              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       YAY Aikea! Another success story               abc123        January 2014       Love the "Who's On First" reference....thanks for asking/answering these questions... And making it funny, too!              Mermaid2349        January 2014       WCSDancer2010, I apologize in advance for hijacking this post, but something you said was exactly what I came to the forum today looking for. Just disclosed, and like Aikea he was great about everything. My question is this, he takes medication that has the side effect of lowering his immune system. And I am wondering what that means in terms of risks to him. I do not want to proceed without doing a bit of research, asking my doctor and the folks on here (who are a lot more knowledgeable than a lot of MD's about the topic) so that he can make an informed choice. I want to keep him safe and herpes free!!! Thanks everyone! Mermaid2349              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       Well, I'm not a doctor so I can't really advise on that. Really, he should talk to HIS doctor about what his risks are. There are many reasons people are on those drugs and some might be more likely to have issues with getting Herpes than others. All we can tell you here is with supressant meds and a condom you can get his risks down to no more than 2% .... and really, I think if you are really, really in tune with your body, perhaps more..... The GOOD thing is that you will have a great excuse to find all kinds of wonderful ways to pleasure each other when you *might* be having an OB that you might not explore otherwise.

Most people with the virus don’t have symptoms. Even without signs of the disease, herpes can still be spread to sex partners.

Genital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are called herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  What is oral herpes?  Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1 and can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes were infected during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.  Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?  Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can be spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex . This is why some cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-1.  How common is genital herpes?  Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.  How is genital herpes spread?  You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.  If you do not have herpes, you can get infected if you come into contact with the herpes virus in:   A herpes sore;  Saliva (if your partner has an oral herpes infection) or genital secretions (if your partner has a genital herpes infection);  Skin in the oral area if your partner has an oral herpes infection, or skin in the genital area if your partner has a genital herpes infection.   You can get herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a sex partner who has oral herpes.  You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools, or from touching objects around you such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have additional questions about how herpes is spread, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.    How can I reduce my risk of getting genital herpes?  The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:   Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results);  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.   Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that are covered by a latex condom. Also, herpes virus can be released (shed) from areas of the skin that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.  If you are in a relationship with a person known to have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting genital herpes if:   Your partner takes an anti-herpes medication every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her doctor.  You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., when your partner is having an outbreak).    I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?  If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is very important for you to go to prenatal care visits. Tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, or have been diagnosed with, genital herpes. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to genital herpes. There is some research that suggests that genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage, or could make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early.  Herpes infection can be passed from you to your unborn child before birth but is more commonly passed to your infant during delivery. This can lead to a potentially deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes at the time of delivery. At the time of delivery, your doctor should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.  How do I know if I have genital herpes?  Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. These symptoms are sometimes called “having an outbreak.” The first time someone has an outbreak they may also have flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, or swollen glands.  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they are infected with HSV-2. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection stays in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.  You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD. STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when urinating, or (for women) bleeding between periods.  How will my doctor know if I have herpes?  Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs.  Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or how long you have been infected.  Can herpes be cured?  There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).  What happens if I don’t get treated?  Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.  If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading your infection.  If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your developing fetus, or newborn baby. See “ I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby? ” above for information about this.  Can I still have sex if I have herpes?  If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) and let him or her know that you do and the risk involved. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.  You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your overall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care provider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while herpes is not curable, it can be managed with medication. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) for herpes can also lower your risk of spreading genital herpes to your sex partner. Be sure to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important to understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs .  What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?  Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, having genital herpes increases the number of CD4 cells (the cells that HIV targets for entry into the body) found in the lining of the genitals. When a person has both HIV and genital herpes, the chances are higher that HIV will be spread to an HIV-uninfected sex partner during sexual contact with their partner’s mouth, vagina, or rectum.

June 17, 2009 12:24 PM   Subscribe  What are my chances of contracting herpes?   I am moving out of the country in a couple weeks. I have reignited a romance with a former flame. He has genital herpes.  I knew about this before we slept together, and we always used condoms and avoided sex if he had an outbreak. I never contracted herpes while I was with him (I had a blood test after we broke up.)  We're not in any kind of relationship, we just have a special connection. I want to have some great memories and good times with him before I leave.  Is it too much of a risk to have sex, assuming we use a condom and he isn't having an outbreak? The information on the internet seems to be all over the map. One nurse I talked to seemed to think the risk was very minimal, a doctor told me she didn't think it was worth the risk.  Would anti-viral drugs be a possibility?  I'm not sure how to talk to him about this, given that we had sex before and I was fine with it.  I'm just trying to measure the risk before I make a decision. Thanks!  posted by anonymous to Health & Fitness (5 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite       I recently talked to my doctor about this, and she said the risk is pretty low (low, single percentage points, if even) if you do everything right (condoms, anti-virals, avoidance at the right times). You're more at risk as a girl, but condoms more effectively protect you as a female, too. Purely anecdotal, but I have a friend with HSV who was married for 10 years and had two long-term relationships and has never passed it to a partner. But really, it's about your own personal comfort with the risk, right? posted by lunalaguna at 12:35 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]  Wikipedia : On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios—meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free—by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. So starting at a 10% risk (annual), if you assume the studied group had sex 100 times / year, the per-incidence trasmission risk would be 1 in 950 . Slap on a condom and have him down some antivirals and you'd looking at a ~1 in 4,000 risk. If you only care about symptomatic infections, then it's 1 in 8,000 per encounter . posted by 1VF5 at 1:08 PM on June 17, 2009  Here is a Savage Love question that is basically the same, with a reversal of genders.  I would recommend this piece of advice , for peace of mind: "Wash thoroughly with soap and water after sex; virii aren't very strong. Soap and hot water kill and/or wash away the herpes virus if it hasn't already made it through a break in your skin. "  Keep in mind that having careful sex with someone who you know the risks about is much safer than having less safe sex with a perfect stranger who could just as easily have something. If you picked up a random guy in the bar, you could be taking the exact same risk. But since you know from the start your partner has herpes, you'll be sure to take the precautions to prevent you from getting it.  Happy fuckin'! posted by Juliet Banana at 1:45 PM on June 17, 2009  Keep in mind that the virus can get into you a lot more easily if you have any breaks in your skin.  Regardless of whether he has any open sores, if you've got (for example) a nick or ingrown hair from bikini line maintenance, or tiny abrasions from the friction of sex, the virus can more easily get into your system.  So keep an eye on your own parts, and be gentle to them.  Use plenty of lube. posted by vytae at 2:09 PM on June 17, 2009  Juliet Banana has it, but obviously be aware that more vigorous washing or any kind of exfoliation is worse, not better. The most important thing is to avoid abrasions or any breaking of the skin. If your partner is not already on an anti-viral, eg Valtrex, daily therapy for him can reduce the odds of spreading the virus (even if he's already asymptomatic). posted by telegraph at 2:54 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]   « Older Recomend some fund raising software.   |   Am I doomed to be a doormat forever?

Can someone infected with herpes continue to have sex without giving it to their partner? Do cold sores, which are almost always caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), protect against genital herpes caused by herpes simplex virus type 2? Can someone be infected with both types of herpes viruses?  Those are among the questions recently posed by readers of the Consults blog. Dr. Peter Leone, an expert on sexually transmitted diseases and associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and Public Health, responds.  What’s My Risk of Spreading Herpes?  Q.  I found out that I have herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) about a month and a half ago. My primary partner, who is male, has been tested twice since then, and both results have been negative. We were fluid-bonded [exposed to each other’s bodily fluids] and had plenty of unprotected sex between my most recent negative result and last month’s positive one. What are the rates of transmission in a serologically discordant couple where the female partner has HSV-2?  I’ve read that it’s:   4 percent in couples who don’t use barriers but avoid sex during outbreaks, and where the woman is not on antiviral suppressive therapy.  2 percent in couples who use condoms and no antivirals.  1 percent in couples who use both condoms and daily antivirals.   Is this accurate? It’s really hard to find comprehensive information on the Internet that gives hard scientific data on rates of transmission.  Stella, Chicago  A.  Dr. Peter Leone responds:  Transmission of HSV-2 to an uninfected partner depends on many different factors, and it is difficult to give precise figures. Studies involving discordant couples, in which one partner has HSV-2 and the other does not, introduce various biases. Discordant couples, for example, have not transmitted the virus between them and are encouraged to use condoms and take other preventive measures. Given these caveats, here’s what we can say:   Women are more likely to acquire HSV-2 from an infected male partner then men are from women. On average, the risk for women acquiring HSV-2 sexually from an infected partner is about 10 percent per year, though there is a large range — from 7 percent to 31 percent — in different studies.  For uninfected men, the risk of sexually acquiring HSV-2 from an infected woman is about 4 percent per year.  Having HSV-1 infection may lower the risk of acquiring HSV-2 sexually, but studies on this provide conflicting results.  Condoms reduce the risk of transmission by about 30 percent, and daily suppressive therapy reduces the risk of transmission by about 48 percent, studies show. Using condoms and taking daily suppressive therapy reduces the risk even further than either measure alone, though studies were not large enough to provide reliable numbers.  Unfortunately, there is no available data on the rate of transmission for same-sex couples.   HSV-2 transmission is more dependent on genitals than gender. What I mean by this is that contact by the penis with either the vagina or rectum is where the greatest risk of transmission occurs. Oral sex is more of an issue for HSV-1 transmission — from mouth to genitals, and indeed, HSV-1 is a fast-growing cause of genital herpes.  Oral sex, though, is not much of a risk for HSV-2, since HSV-2 oral infection is rare and shedding of HSV-2 from the mouth is extremely low.  Can You Be Infected With Both Types of Herpes?  Q.  Can a person have both HSV-1 and HSV-2? And what would it do to your chances of contracting H.I.V.? Or hepatitis C, for that matter?  cardo, Chico, Calif.  A.  Dr. Peter Leone responds:  Yes. About 10 percent of adults in the United States have both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Of those with HSV-2, about 40 percent are co-infected with HSV-1.  HSV-2 increases the risk for H.I.V. acquisition. Someone infected with HSV-2 has two to five times greater risk of acquiring H.I.V. through sexual intercourse compared with someone who is not infected with HSV-2. HSV-1 does not increase the risk of H.I.V.  Your question about whether herpes increases the risk of contracting hepatitis C is an interesting one. The biggest risk for hepatitis C is through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But hepatitis C can also be sexually transmitted, and it appears that the risk may be increased in women and in men who have sex with men who are also infected with HSV-2.  Do Cold Sores Protect Against Genital Herpes?  Q.  As a kid, I had oral herpes (painful sores on inside of mouth, etc.), and then many years later I dated a girl for two years who had herpes, and I never caught it (though we often, though not always, used condoms). I’m long since married now, but I’ve always wondered, does having had oral herpes make one immune to contracting genital herpes?  Nathan, NYC  A.  Dr. Peter Leone responds:  Cold sores are almost always – 98 percent of the time — caused by HSV-1. Having HSV-1 infection may make it more difficult to acquire HSV-2 infection, but, at best, offers only partial immunity.  If someone with HSV-1 acquires HSV-2, he or she is likely to have a mild first outbreak of HSV-2 — or there may not be any symptoms at all. Nearly 40 percent of individuals infected with HSV-2 are also infected with HSV-1. Maybe you don’t have HSV-2 infection, but the only way to know for sure is to get a blood test for HSV-2.

Genital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are called herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  What is oral herpes?  Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1 and can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes were infected during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.  Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?  Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can be spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex . This is why some cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-1.  How common is genital herpes?  Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.  How is genital herpes spread?  You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.  If you do not have herpes, you can get infected if you come into contact with the herpes virus in:   A herpes sore;  Saliva (if your partner has an oral herpes infection) or genital secretions (if your partner has a genital herpes infection);  Skin in the oral area if your partner has an oral herpes infection, or skin in the genital area if your partner has a genital herpes infection.   You can get herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a sex partner who has oral herpes.  You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools, or from touching objects around you such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have additional questions about how herpes is spread, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.    How can I reduce my risk of getting genital herpes?  The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:   Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results);  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.   Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that are covered by a latex condom. Also, herpes virus can be released (shed) from areas of the skin that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.  If you are in a relationship with a person known to have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting genital herpes if:   Your partner takes an anti-herpes medication every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her doctor.  You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., when your partner is having an outbreak).    I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?  If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is very important for you to go to prenatal care visits. Tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, or have been diagnosed with, genital herpes. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to genital herpes. There is some research that suggests that genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage, or could make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early.  Herpes infection can be passed from you to your unborn child before birth but is more commonly passed to your infant during delivery. This can lead to a potentially deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes at the time of delivery. At the time of delivery, your doctor should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.  How do I know if I have genital herpes?  Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. These symptoms are sometimes called “having an outbreak.” The first time someone has an outbreak they may also have flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, or swollen glands.  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they are infected with HSV-2. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection stays in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.  You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD. STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when urinating, or (for women) bleeding between periods.  How will my doctor know if I have herpes?  Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs.  Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or how long you have been infected.  Can herpes be cured?  There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).  What happens if I don’t get treated?  Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.  If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading your infection.  If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your developing fetus, or newborn baby. See “ I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby? ” above for information about this.  Can I still have sex if I have herpes?  If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) and let him or her know that you do and the risk involved. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.  You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your overall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care provider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while herpes is not curable, it can be managed with medication. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) for herpes can also lower your risk of spreading genital herpes to your sex partner. Be sure to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important to understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs .  What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?  Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, having genital herpes increases the number of CD4 cells (the cells that HIV targets for entry into the body) found in the lining of the genitals. When a person has both HIV and genital herpes, the chances are higher that HIV will be spread to an HIV-uninfected sex partner during sexual contact with their partner’s mouth, vagina, or rectum.

By  Alicia Coffman   On 5/12/08 at 12:28 PM   Share         Culture Cold sores--they always seem to pop up when you have a big interview, first date or important event. You know what they look like and what a pain they can be, but are they a sexually transmitted disease? According Dr. Craig Austin, a dermatologist in New York City, cold sores usually aren't a sexually transmitted disease (STD). They are caused by the herpes simplex virus. There are two kinds of herpes virus: HSV-1, which is usually not an STD and occurs on the lip, and HSV-2, which usually causes herpes genitalis, which is essentially an STD in the genital area. Both viruses can be transmitted by saliva, body secretions or oral sex. If you contract either kind of herpes you will always have the virus because the cold sore lives in the sensory nerve and stays dormant in the nerve until outbreaks occur. Some people only get one cold sore in their lives and may not realize they are carrying a latent form of the virus. Even if you don't have a visible cold sore, there's a chance you can still transmit the virus through your saliva or via oral sex, says Dr. Barry Goldman, the chief of dermatology at New York Downtown Hospital. (An outbreak of HSV-1 in the genital area becomes a form of genital herpes.) So, what are the triggers for those pesky cold sores? Emotional stress, the flu, the common cold, dental work and UVB rays from sunlight can all prompt the sore to the surface, said Dr. Ofer M. Wellisch,  a clinical researcher in New York City. (When they appear after a day in the sun or after the flu, they are sometimes called "sun blisters" or "fever blisters," but they are caused by the herpes virus.)

Apply sunblock to the face. 2. Use lip-balm with SPF. 3. Take time out to do stress-reducing activities like meditation , physical activity or getting a neck message. 4. Avoid kissing anyone with a cold sore. 5. Avoid sharing items like toothbrushes, lip-balm or towels. 6. Always remember to wash your hands if you suspect you've had contact with a cold sore.

What You Need to Know About Herpes Transmission Medically reviewed by Alana Biggers, MD on  April 13, 2017 — Written by Corey Whelan HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral transmission Symptoms Prevention Overview  Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) is one of two types of the herpes virus and is rarely transmitted orally. However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. People with compromised immune systems in particular may be at risk.  HSV2 is a sexually transmitted virus that causes sores and blisters known as herpes lesions. In order to be infected with HSV2, there has to be skin-to-skin contact between an infected person and a partner. HSV2 is not transmitted through semen.  Once HSV2 enters the body, it travels through the nervous system to the spinal nerves, where it typically comes to rest in the sacral ganglia, a cluster of nerve tissue located near the base of the spine. After the initial infection, HSV2 lies dormant in your nerves. When it becomes activated, a process known as viral shedding occurs. Viral shedding is when the virus replicates. Viral shedding may cause a herpes outbreak and symptoms such as herpes lesions. These usually occur in the genitals or rectum. However, it’s also possible for the virus to be activated and for no visible symptoms to occur.  HSV2 can be asymptomatic, which means it causes no apparent symptoms. That’s why it’s important to use protection during sexual activity and to get tested regularly by a doctor if you are sexually active. You can still transmit the virus to a partner even if you don’t have any apparent symptoms.  HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral
transmission  The other commonly transmitted strain of the herpes simplex virus , HSV1, typically results in oral herpes, or cold sores around the mouth. This form of HSV is more readily transmitted via oral contact, such as kissing, than through genital contact. HSV1 can be transmitted through both giving and receiving oral sex. It can cause both mouth and genital sores. You can also get HSV1 through vaginal and anal intercourse, and through the use of sex toys.  Unlike HSV2, which usually lies dormant between outbreaks at the base of the spine, HSV1’s latency periods are typically spent in nerve endings near the ear. That is why it is more likely to cause oral herpes than genital herpes.  HSV1 and HSV2 are genetically similar to each other. For this reason, having one form of the virus sometimes reduces risk of contracting the other form. This is because your body actively produces antibodies to fight the virus once you have it. However, it is possible to contract both forms.  Symptoms Symptoms to look out
for  HSV1 and HSV2 can both have no symptoms or very mild symptoms that you might not notice. Not having symptoms does not mean you do not have the virus.  If you do have symptoms of HSV1, they may include:  a tingling sensation, itching, or pain, anywhere in the genital area or around the mouth one or more small, white blisters that may become oozy, or bloody one or more small, red bumps or irritated-looking skin  It is important to see a doctor if you suspect you have contracted HSV1 or HSV2. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help reduce the number and severity of your outbreaks.  Prevention How to prevent HSV transmission  HSV2 can often be prevented with some proactive strategies. These include:  Prevention tips Always use a condom during any type of sexual activity. Avoid having sex during herpes outbreaks, but be aware that people with herpes may have no symptoms and still transmit the virus. Maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with an infection-free person. Communicate with your sexual partner or partners if you have HSV, and ask if they have it themselves. Abstaining from all forms of sexual activity or reducing the number of sexual partners you have also reduces risk.

HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes (which can include symptoms known as “cold sores”), but can also cause genital herpes.  HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital herpes.  Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are lifelong.  An estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) have HSV-1 infection globally.  An estimated 417 million people aged 15-49 (11%) worldwide have HSV-2 infection.  Most oral and genital herpes infections are asymptomatic.  Symptoms of herpes include painful blisters or ulcers at the site of infection.  Herpes infections are most contagious when symptoms are present but can still be transmitted to others in the absence of symptoms.  Infection with HSV-2 increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection.    Introduction   Infection with the herpes simplex virus, commonly known as herpes, can be due to either herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral to oral contact to cause infection in or around the mouth (oral herpes). HSV-2 is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, causing infection in the genital or anal area (genital herpes). However, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes.   Both oral herpes infections and genital herpes infections are mostly asymptomatic but can cause mild symptoms or painful blisters or ulcers at the site of infection.   Herpes simplex virus - type 1 (HSV-1)  Herpes simplex virus - type 2 (HSV-2)   Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)   HSV-1 is a highly contagious infection, which is common and endemic throughout the world. Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood, and infection is lifelong. The vast majority of HSV-1 infections are oral herpes (infections in or around the mouth, sometimes called orolabial, oral-labial or oral-facial herpes), but a proportion of HSV-1 infections are genital herpes (infections in the genital or anal area).  Scope of the problem   In 2012, an estimated 3.7 billion people under the age of 50, or 67% of the population, had HSV-1 infection. Estimated prevalence of the infection was highest in Africa (87%) and lowest in the Americas (40-50%).   With respect to genital HSV-1 infection, 140 million people aged 15-49-years were estimated to have genital HSV-1 infection worldwide in 2012, but prevalence varied substantially by region. Most genital HSV-1 infections are estimated to occur in the Americas, Europe and Western Pacific, where HSV-1 continues to be acquired well into adulthood. In other regions, for example in Africa, most HSV-1 infections are acquired in childhood, before the age of sexual debut.  Signs and symptoms   Oral herpes infection is mostly asymptomatic, and the majority of people with HSV-1 infection are unaware they are infected. Symptoms of oral herpes include painful blisters or open sores called ulcers in or around the mouth. Sores on the lips are commonly referred to as “cold sores.” Infected persons will often experience a tingling, itching or burning sensation around their mouth, before the appearance of sores. After initial infection, the blisters or ulcers can periodically recur. The frequency of recurrences varies from person to person.   Genital herpes caused by HSV-1 can be asymptomatic or can have mild symptoms that go unrecognized. When symptoms do occur, genital herpes is characterised by 1 or more genital or anal blisters or ulcers. After an initial genital herpes episode, which may be severe, symptoms may recur, but genital herpes caused by HSV-1 often does not recur frequently.  Transmission   HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes infection, via contact with the HSV-1 virus in sores, saliva, and surfaces in or around the mouth. However, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes.   HSV-1 can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal and when there are no symptoms present. However, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores.   Individuals who already have HSV-1 oral herpes infection are unlikely to be subsequently infected with HSV-1 in the genital area.   In rare circumstances, HSV-1 infection can be transmitted from a mother with genital HSV-1 infection to her infant during delivery.  Possible complications  Severe disease   In immunocompromised people, such as those with advanced HIV infection, HSV-1 can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences. Rarely, HSV-1 infection can also lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis or keratitis (eye infection).  Neonatal herpes   Neonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV in the genital tract during delivery. This is a rare condition, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100,000 births globally, but can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV infection for the first time in late pregnancy. Women who have genital herpes before they become pregnant are at very low risk of transmitting HSV to their infants.  Psychosocial impact   Recurrent symptoms of oral herpes may be uncomfortable and can lead to some social stigma and psychological distress. With genital herpes, these factors can have an important impact on quality of life and sexual relationships. However, in time, most people with either kind of herpes adjust to living with the infection.  Treatment   Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir, are the most effective medications available for people infected with HSV. These can help to reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms, but cannot cure the infection.    WHO guidelines for the treatment of Genital Herpes Simplex Virus    Prevention   HSV-1 is most contagious during an outbreak of symptomatic oral herpes, but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible. People with active symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others and sharing objects that have contact with saliva. They should also abstain from oral sex, to avoid transmitting herpes to the genitals of a sexual partner. Individuals with symptoms of genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity whilst experiencing any of the symptoms.   People who already have HSV-1 infection are not at risk of getting it again, but they are still at risk of acquiring herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) genital infection (see below).   The consistent and correct use of condoms can help to prevent the spread of genital herpes. However, condoms can only reduce the risk of infection, as outbreaks of genital herpes can occur in areas not covered by a condom.   Pregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers. Preventing acquisition of a new genital herpes infection is particularly important for women in late pregnancy, as this is when the risk for neonatal herpes is greatest.   Additional research is underway to develop more effective prevention methods against HSV infection, such as vaccines. Several candidate HSV vaccines are currently being studied.  Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)   HSV-2 infection is widespread throughout the world and is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, causing genital herpes. HSV-2 is the main cause of genital herpes, which can also be caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Infection with HSV-2 is lifelong and incurable.  Scope of the problem   Genital herpes caused by HSV-2 is a global issue, and an estimated 417 million people worldwide were living with the infection in 2012. Prevalence of HSV-2 infection was estimated to be highest in Africa (31.5%), followed by the Americas (14.4%). It was also shown to increase with age, though the highest numbers of people newly-infected were adolescents.   More women are infected with HSV-2 than men; in 2012 it was estimated that 267 million women and 150 million men were living with the infection. This is because sexual transmission of HSV is more efficient from men to women than from women to men.  Signs and symptoms   Genital herpes infections often have no symptoms, or mild symptoms that go unrecognised. Most infected people are unaware that they have the infection. Typically, about 10-20% of people with HSV-2 infection report a prior diagnosis of genital herpes.   When symptoms do occur, genital herpes is characterised by one or more genital or anal blisters or open sores called ulcers. In addition to genital ulcers, symptoms of new genital herpes infections often include fever, body aches, and swollen lymph nodes.   After an initial genital herpes infection with HSV-2, recurrent symptoms are common but often less severe than the first outbreak. The frequency of outbreaks tends to decrease over time. People infected with HSV-2 may experience sensations of mild tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips, and buttocks before the occurrence of genital ulcers.  Transmission   HSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex, through contact with genital surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted from skin in the genital or anal area that looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.   In rare circumstances, HSV-2 infection can be transmitted from a mother to her infant during delivery.  Possible complications  HSV-2 and HIV   HSV-2 and HIV have been shown to influence each other. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring a new HIV infection by approximately three-fold. In addition, people with both HIV and HSV-2 infection are more likely to spread HIV to others. HSV-2 is amongst the most common infections in people living with HIV, occurring in 60-90% of HIV-infected persons.   Infection with HSV-2 in people living with HIV (and other immunocompromised individuals) often has a more severe presentation and more frequent recurrences. In advanced HIV disease, HSV-2 can lead to more serious, but rare, complications such as meningoencephalitis, esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinal necrosis, or disseminated infection.  Neonatal herpes   Neonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV in the genital tract during delivery. This is a rare condition, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100,000 births globally, but can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV infection for the first time in late pregnancy. Women who have genital herpes before they become pregnant are at very low risk of transmitting HSV to their infants.  Psychosocial impact   Recurrent symptoms of genital herpes may be painful and the infection can lead to social stigma and psychological distress. These factors can have an important impact on quality of life and sexual relationships. However, in time, most people with herpes adjust to living with the infection.  Treatment   Antivirals, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are the most effective medications available for people infected with HSV. These can help to reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms, but cannot cure the infection.    WHO guidelines for the treatment of Genital Herpes Simplex Virus    Prevention   Individuals with genital HSV infection should abstain from sexual activity whilst experiencing symptoms of genital herpes. HSV-2 is most contagious during an outbreak of sores, but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible.   The consistent and correct use of condoms can help reduce the risk of spreading genital herpes. However, condoms only provide partial protection, as HSV can be found in areas not covered by a condom. Medical male circumcision can provide men life-long partial protection against HSV-2, in addition to HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).   Pregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers. Preventing acquisition of a new genital herpes infection is particularly important for women in late pregnancy, as this is when the risk for neonatal herpes is greatest.   Additional research is underway to develop more effective prevention methods against HSV infection, such as vaccines or topical microbicides (compounds which can be applied inside the vagina or rectum to protect against sexually transmitted infections).  WHO response to herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2)   WHO and partners are working to accelerate research to develop new strategies for prevention and control of genital and neonatal HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. Such research includes the development of HSV vaccines and topical microbicides. Several candidate vaccines and microbicides are currently being studied.

SHARE TWEET Cindy Kuzma Feb 15 2017, 3:00pm Jonathan Knowles/Getty Images Herpes infects more people worldwide than any other sexually transmitted infection—and it spreads through a simple equation: One partner has the virus. Another partner doesn't. Any sexual contact between the two can infect the uninfected.  Anal, vaginal, oral, fingering—it doesn't matter; you can still share the bug. "It all depends on what's coming into contact with what," says Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist and spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.  The virus most easily enters the body through a break in the skin, Glatt says—say, an abrasion from rough sex, a cut in your mouth, or a sore from another condition. (Having any one STI increases your risk for acquiring a second.) However, herpes can also slip through the body's normal defenses, especially through mucus membranes in the mouth, eyes, genitals, or rectum.  There's no cure for herpes—and though your risk of spreading it tends to decrease over the years, it's still possible for you to infect a partner. Here's what you need to know to avoid sharing more than you bargained for.   Sex Isn't The Only Way to Test Positive If your doc gives you a herpes diagnosis, make sure you're clear on exactly what you have, Glatt says. There are eight types of herpes simplex virus. One type, HSV-2, causes most cases of genital herpes. Another, HSV-1, most often causes cold sores—but perhaps due to all the great oral we're giving and receiving, type 1 is increasingly causing genital infections too.  If you gave every American a blood test, nine out of ten would have some evidence of infection with one of the eight types, Glatt says. But only about one in six has genital herpes .  "Ask: What type of herpes, how did I get it, and is it sexually transmitted?" Glatt says. Your doc should be able to shoot straight with you. If you test positive but the infection doesn't affect your genital area, chances are you were exposed in some other way—say, sucking on the same toy as an infected toddler way back in day care.  If you do have sores on your private parts, ask your doctor to take a swab. He or she can test the fluid from the sores for the virus, rather than just looking for antibodies the way blood tests do, Glatt says.  When those swabs come back positive, it doesn't really matter if you have type 1 or type 2, he says. You have genital herpes—most likely acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. The steps for stopping its spread are the same for both types.   You Can Pass It On Even If You're Not Having an Outbreak Clusters of red, blistery bumps serve as the telltale sign of oral or genital herpes. When you're first infected, they usually show up within two to ten days. The sores may burst, crust over, then heal—only to come back. Recurrent outbreaks are most common during the first year, Glatt says.  The pus that oozes out of these sores contains millions of viruses, says Philip Werthman, a urologist and director of the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine in Los Angeles. "That's the most contagious time during an outbreak, when the blisters pop."  But even when your skin's clear, you're not off the hook. You might still be shedding the virus, Werthman says. Though the counts are smaller—likely in the hundreds instead of millions—herpes can still infect your partner.  In fact, about 70 percent of transmissions occur during asymptomatic periods, says James Whiteside, an obstetrician/gynecologist at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.  Often, this occurs soon before or after an active outbreak. Most people have a tingly, aching, itching, or stinging sensation when they're about to develop sores—a phenomenon experts call "prodrome." If you avoid sex from the moment you feel these symptoms through a couple of weeks after your sores heal, you'll reduce the risk of infecting your partner, Whiteside says.   Condoms Work—To a Point When you're not in the midst of an active outbreak, wrap it up. Consistent condom use reduces your risk of passing along the virus by about 30 percent, according to a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine .  But of course, condoms can break and are prone to user error. Even when operated flawlessly, they're not as effective against herpes as they are against pregnancy, Glatt says. Skin-to-skin contact before the condom goes on, or between uncovered areas, still leaves the uninfected partner vulnerable.   Women Face a Greater Risk Speaking of vulnerable—women's larger expanses of mucus membranes in and around the vagina increase their odds of catching herpes. That's especially true when they have sex with men, who are more likely than women to shed the virus even when they don't have symptoms, Whiteside says.  In fact, rates of transmission from men to women stand at about 10 percent, while women pass herpes to uninfected men only about 4 percent of the time, he says.   You Can Give It To Yourself. Autoinoculation might sound like a scene from the new 50 Shades movie—but in fact, it's a term for the uncommon but possible circumstance of reinfecting yourself with the virus, Werthman says.  Say you have an open sore and you touch it with your hands. If you have a cut or scrape, the virus can re-enter your skin and cause painful blisters called herpetic whitlow on your fingers. If you then touch your eyes, you can also get herpetic keratitis.  You could even infect another person by touching your sores and then shaking hands, Werthman says. So, keep your hands off your junk when you have an active outbreak—or at the very least, wash or sanitize them afterward.   Antiviral Drugs Help Reduce Symptoms If your outbreaks are frequent or severe, your doctor may prescribe medications that suppress the virus and relieve herpes symptoms. This also reduces the chances of spreading the disease. In fact, daily doses of a drug called valacyclovir cut your risk of infecting your partner by about half, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine .  And even more effective options may be on the horizon. In a recent JAMA  study , an experimental drug called pritelivir reduced both the frequency of outbreaks and the number of days the infected person shed the virus. However, it's not yet available here in the United States.  Researchers are also working to develop a vaccine for the condition. Unlike, say, a flu shot that prevents you from catching a virus, this vaccine is given to people who already have genital herpes.  In early studies , three shots over the course of three weeks reduced the number of days in which an infected person shed virus by about half over the course of the year—potentially cutting the odds of transmission, too. However, it could be years before such methods are FDA-approved, Glatt points out. In the meantime, good old monogamy—or condoms—remain your best bet.
