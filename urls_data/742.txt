By Hayden Walles   Jenny Chisholm doesn’t mention whether she has a particular man and his mother in mind but she wonders about the truth of this. We’re well conditioned to expect a boy to outgrow his mother, and it’s probably even the usual result, but it isn’t a foregone conclusion.  The genetics of height are not simple. Old Gregor “fiddle-the-numbers” Mendel got a lot of press with his peas and their recessive and dominant genes. Some human characteristics like eye colour work this way, where a single gene, or at most a handful of genes, control a feature in a simple and predictable way. But there is no single gene controlling skin colour or height, instead a great number work together to produce the fine gradation in colour and height that we see around us.  It may help to imagine that there is one gene controlling the length of every little part of the body, each saying long or short. Your height then depends on the combination of all of the genes controlling the length of your spine and legs because they all contribute to a little bit of height.  If you let a mathematician get hold of that idea then they can tell you some interesting things. One is that a better prediction of your height comes not from the heights of your mother and father but from the average of their heights. It follows (you are following, aren’t you?) that a tall mother and a short father can expect to have children shorter than the mother but taller than the father. If only Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman hadn’t split before having any children of their own. That would have been a nice demonstration — what we in the science biz call a natural experiment.  A son can generally expect to be taller than his mother if his father is taller than his mother and our mores ensure this is generally the case. But this is a a cultural accident, not a biological law. The long and the short of it is that sons can be shorter than their mothers.   Posted Sat 10 Apr 2010.

By Jeannette Moninger, Photo by Ronnie Andren from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Such Great Heights         Ronnie Andren  Eight-year-old Sam Merritt can jump on his bed without worrying about hitting his head; he can squeeze into tight spaces during hide-and-seek; and he figures he'll never have to duck when he gets off the school bus. But he does have to listen to endless comments from strangers, classmates, and even relatives about his size. At 3'10", Sam looks more like a kindergartner than a third-grader. To make matters worse, his 4'2" twin sister, Amanda, is tall for her age. "People make the most insensitive remarks like, 'No, they can't be twins -- he looks like the little brother,'" says their dad, Scott, of Loganville, Georgia. "It bothers me, so it must get to him." Four-year-old Veronica Meyer, however, has inches to spare. The 4-foot-tall preschooler from Brooklyn is the same height as many 7-year-old girls. Her 2-year-old sister, Natalie, is tall too. "People ask what I feed them, like there's some super food for height," says their mother, Julie. "I'm nearly 6' and my husband is 6'2". Our daughters obviously inherited our tall genes, but people still feel the need to point out their size." Kids come in all shapes: tall or short, round or pencil thin. And they all want to fit in and be accepted. But when you're dwarfed by classmates -- or you tower above them -- fitting in can be more of a challenge. "Kids get teased about physical differences like height, weight, having a big nose, or wearing glasses. Unfortunately, people make a lot of judgments -- and a lot of thoughtless comments -- based on appearances," says Meredith Dreyer, PhD, a pediatric psychologist at Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, in Kansas City, Missouri. Measuring Up This fixation on size begins moments after your baby's born. Everyone wants to know his height and weight stats. From then on, the pediatrician will measure him at every checkup. While inches and pounds are important, growth is key. First developed 30 years ago, government growth charts gauge how his measurements compare with those of other kids of the same age and gender. "We don't worry as long as a child grows steadily, but an unusual jump in height or a sudden falloff in growth can be a sign of a health problem," says Elizabeth Littlejohn, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital. During his first year, your baby grows up to 10 inches in length. However, his early size isn't very predictive of his final height or weight. He'll add about five inches during his second year, and then starting at age 3, he'll grow about two and a half inches per year until a final growth spurt kicks in during puberty. Girls reach their adult height around 15 (the average American woman is 5'4"), while boys don't top out until 16 or 17 (the average American male is 5'9"). A school-age child who falls below the 5th percentile for height is considered to be of "short stature," a clinical term meaning he's shorter than 95 percent of kids his same age and gender, whereas a child who's in the 95th percentile is taller than all but a few of her peers. Average height is anywhere between the 40th and 60th percentiles. You can look at your family tree to figure out your child's future potential: Height is about 80 percent genetic. A child whose parents are both 6' is likely to be the tallest kid in kindergarten. If both parents are unusually short, their children probably will be short too. But even kids who have average-height or tall parents may inexplicably stop growing -- a condition known as idiopathic short stature (ISS). These children are significantly shorter than 99 percent of their peers, and will remain small as adults. "Boys generally won't grow to be more than 5'4", while the girls might hit 4'11"," says Dr. Littlejohn. Late bloomers, on the other hand, are small for their age but still growing at a normal rate and will eventually have a growth spurt and catch up to their peers. Short Stuff People often presume that short kids -- especially boys -- aren't as popular as tall kids and are often teased, bullied, or depressed about their size. However, one study of almost 1,000 middle- and high-schoolers found that height made little difference in how much classmates like each other. "Short kids tend to be well-adjusted and to have just as many friends as taller classmates," says study author David E. Sandberg, PhD, a pediatric psychologist at the University of Michigan Medical School, in Ann Arbor. "If these older kids are faring okay at a time when height differences are most noticeable and bullying is more of an issue, then younger kids who are short are probably fine too." Although the study's findings are encouraging, it can still be tough to be little -- particularly if you're a boy. "It's more socially acceptable for a girl to be small than for a boy to be short," says Dr. Dreyer. After all, girls are referred to in flattering ways -- petite, cute -- while boys tend to be called shrimp, shorty, or peewee. Even parents would rather have tall sons. One study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia found that boys are taken to growth specialists twice as often as girls are, even though boys aren't more prone to shortness. "Society views tall men as being strong, confident, and desirable, and parents of small boys don't want their sons to have a disadvantage in life," says study author Adda Grimberg, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. If your child's on the short side, it can be difficult for you to watch other kids, and even tactless adults, treat him differently because of his size -- especially if you had a similar experience when you were a kid. But if you're overly fixated on his height or get defensive when people comment about it, he could get the message that being small is bad or that his size defines him, says Dr. Grimberg. Instead, give your child the tools he needs to feel good about himself inside and out. Find areas where he can shine. Small kids can excel at lots of sports, including soccer, gymnastics, and martial arts. But if your child wants to play basketball or volleyball, encourage him to try it. Of course, there are also plenty of nonphysical activities he can get involved in, such as playing a musical instrument or acting in the school play. Problem-solve. If your child is being picked on, brainstorm solutions together and practice responses so she feels confident sticking up for herself. "Bullies want to get a rise out of their victim. When you don't react or you react unexpectedly, it takes away their fun," says Dr. Dreyer. Some deadpan replies for pint-size taunts: "Thanks a lot, I didn't know I was short" or "Wow, you're really observant." Encourage him to speak up. When people mistakenly assume that Ethan Udell is only 6 years old, the fourth-grader from Dix Hills, New York, quickly corrects them and gives them something else to talk about. "He tells people, 'I'm actually 9 1/2, and I'm a really good hockey player,'" says his mom, Stacey. Other upbeat responses to try: "Shortness is only one of my great qualities" or "I take after my grandfather." Respect her age. Don't say that your child is younger than she really is to get discounted tickets to movies or amusement parks. It might save you a few dollars, but it'll cost her self-esteem. High Anxiety Tall kids might seem to be on top of the world, but height has its downsides. Because they look older than their years, adults -- and even peers -- often expect them to behave more maturely. When Marissa Cooper, then 3, had a perfectly age-appropriate meltdown in a mall in Greenwood, Indiana, her mom, Heather, got snippy comments from strangers who assumed the girl was at least 5. "A woman said loudly to her friend, 'Isn't she a little old for tantrums?'" says Cooper. Now 6, Marissa is as tall as many 9-year-old girls, and that complicates playdates. Kids her age assume an "older" child won't want to play with them and are intimidated by her size, while kids her height find her too immature. "It's tough being a tall girl, and it just gets worse during the dating years," says Cooper, who's 5'8" and knows from her own childhood experience. Life's not a slam dunk for tall boys either. Adults generally expect that they're great at sports, but that's not necessarily true. Answering nonstop inquiries about his athletic abilities can be stressful for a child who's already tired of being singled out for his size. And then there's bullying. "When you're 8 but look 10, older kids like to challenge you. They'll say, 'So I bet you think you're as tough as me. Prove it,'" says Carleton Kendrick, a family therapist in Boston who was the tallest kid in his class. Still, tall kids have been known to throw their height around. A study at the University of Southern California found that both boys and girls who stand a mere half-inch taller than their peers at age 3 tend to be more aggressive by age 11. Experts speculate that tall boys and girls have higher testosterone levels, which contributes to aggressiveness. Or it could also be that tall kids learn early on to use force to get what they want. When your child gets sick of all the bean-stalk remarks, try these tactics. Take it as a compliment. Encourage your child to be proud of her height. Your daughter might say: "Thanks for noticing. I take after my dad," or "My grandma is tall too." Tell your own tall tales. Know what it's like to stick out in a crowd? Share what you liked about being a tall child: You could sit in the back row and still see over classmates' heads. You could ride anything at the amusement park. Rebound from stereotypes. Your child doesn't have to explain that he's not into basketball or other sports. He can just say, "No, I don't play," and mention what he does like to do: "I love to ride my bike," or "I'm really good at math." Whether your child is tall or short or somewhere in between, remind him that all kids are teased for some reason or another, suggests Dr. Dreyer. And try to help him see his height isn't such a huge deal. Where bigness really counts -- in terms of kindness, generosity, intelligence, and love -- is on the inside. Shots for Short Kids? About one in 3,500 children have growth-hormone deficiency, meaning they don't produce enough growth hormone for normal development and need daily injections of synthetic growth hormone to achieve something close to a normal height. In 2003, the FDA expanded approval for growth-hormone therapy to include the 1 percent of kids with idiopathic short stature (ISS). With treatment, children with ISS can gain an average of two to five inches depending on the cause of the slow growth and how many years they're in treatment. Studies have found that growth-hormone therapy is very safe for children. Side effects are rare and may include ear infections, muscle or joint pain, headaches, nausea, breast growth, and skin rashes. However, the treatment costs about $20,000 per year, with some kids needing it for five years or longer, and insurance doesn't always cover the cost.

Phenotypic variance is the addition of the enviornmental variance and the genetic variance (and their covariance). In other words, the environment, not only the genes influence someone's height. This is one reason that may explain why an offsrping may be taller that their parents. – Remi.b  Oct 15 '14 at 15:24        4      If it were true, wouldn't it likewise be true that no child could be shorter than their shorter parent?

Anecdotally: I'm 185 cm, my parents are 155 cm and 178 cm. Joakim Noah , an NBA basketball player is 211 cm, his dad was 193 cm and mother was 175 cm ... how?  Genetics and environment play a role in determining height. First of all, a more nutritious environment during development can lead to increased height, this is one reason why more recent generations appear to be taller.  Height is also an example of a quantitative trait - this means many genes (or loci [singular is locus], locations in the DNA) affect the phenotype (the physical measurable result i.e. a persons height). It is infact how the vast majority of traits are determined. At each locus that affects height there may be polymorphism (when more than one allele, or variant of that gene, exists).  Example:  Suppose height entirely is determined by 2 additive loci, $A$ and $B$, and no environmental effect occurs, and there is diploidy (two of each locus, one from each parent, determines height in a person).  Each locus has two alleles denoted by $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1 $ and $B_2$. Each copy of alleles $A_1$ and $B_1$ add 40 cm to a persons height, $A_2$ and $B_2$ add 50 cm to a persons height.  Now a man who is $A_1 A_1, B_1 B_2$ (remember, humans are diploid) and a woman who is $A_2 A_1, B_1 B_1$ have children. Both parents are 170 cm tall. The theoretical limits for the population would be 160 cm and 200 cm. The children will inherit one copy of $A_1$ from the father and $B_1$ from the mother, but they could inherit either $B_1$ or $B_2$ from the father and either $A_1$ or $A_2$ from the mother. If a child inherited both of the taller alleles then they would be taller than the parents ($A_1 A_2, B_1 B_2$ = 180 cm). Likewise some offspring could be shorter.  Of course the reality is much more complex; height is determined by many more than 2 loci, by the environment, and gene * environment interactions. This principle was a hugely important because it meant that reproduction did not necessarily remove variation from the gene pool (a fundamental problem with early evolutionary theory was the thought of "blending" - when offspring are the average of their parents)     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 15:15             answered Oct 15 '14 at 15:08       Ell   13.8k 4 49 93              add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Yes, people can definitely grow taller than their parents. Height is a polygenic quantitative trait (so affected by many genes), that is also strongly affected by environmental factors. You are also forgetting that there is a sex difference in height (~14 cm, Wright & Cheetham, 1999 ), so the height of the mother does for instance not set an absolute cap on the height of her sons (" ....can't grow taller than either of their parents "), but her genetic background will influence their heights. If both parents are e.g. 180 cm tall, that is close to the population average for the father but considered tall for the mother, she is likely to carry genes that contribute to her offspring being tall.  That height is a polygenetic quantitative trait means that parental height will be a good predictor of offspring height, but with a wide scatter around the mean. Normally, 90% of children fall within 1.5 standard deviations of their midparental heights, after being sex-adjusted with +- 7cm for boys and girls ( Wright & Cheetham, 1999 ). For simplicity, it is often said that 90% of children will fall within 10cm of the sex-adjusted mid-parental height. However, the deviations are smaller if the parents are unusually short or tall, representing "regression to the mean", and parental height is a poorer predictor for offspring height in these cases. Using the midparent mean as a predictor of offspring height is otherwise standard practice, as can be seen in online applications (e.g. http://medcalc3000.com/HeightPotential.htm ). Using the same example as above, with both parents being 180 cm, will predict an offspring height of 186cm for sons and 174cm for daughters.  That height is strongly influenced by nutrition has been clearly shown in the general secular trend in body height in developed countries over the last centuries ( Cole, 2003 , where the average height of successive generations have been taller than their parents. For instance, the average height in the Netherlands have increased from 165 cm in 1860 to 181 cm in 1990 (numbers from Cole, 2003 ). Some of the online height calculators you see will also include a corrections for this, and add e.g. 1-2 cm to the mid-parent heights before correcting for sex.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 20 '16 at 20:57             answered Aug 12 '15 at 9:14       fileunderwater   14k 3 37 77              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Yes it is quite possible, recall nature vs nurture. I myself am slightly taller than both of my parents by about a head. As long as you have sufficient nutrition it should be quite possible.  And what you said about gene activation skipping generations is quite true- it can indeed happen, and if the gene responsible for height is not expressed in the parents but is in their offspring then it will also be more likely for the child to grow taller than their parent.     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 0:48             answered Oct 15 '14 at 0:38       Sherlock Holmes   127 6              add a comment |         protected by Chris ♦  Aug 12 '15 at 6:06   Thank you for your interest in this question.

It's in Your Genes When Does Height Happen? How Tall Will I Be? Height-Related Worries What Can I Do Right Now?     Print en español Sentirse demasiado alto o demasiado bajo "Line up shortest to tallest!" the teacher calls out. "Not again," some kids might groan — especially if they have to stand at one end or the other.  For most kids, height isn't something they can change, so what do you do if you don't like how tall or short you are? It might be girls feeling too tall and boys feeling too short. But some really tall boys might not like all that height and some shorter girls might get tired of all the jokes or of feeling like they're staying little while their friends are growing up.  It's in Your Genes  But the truth is that everyone is growing up — it's just that they're doing it at their own pace. In other words, your body grows on its own schedule. You can't wish yourself taller or stretch yourself. Or if you're already tall, you can't do anything to hurry your friends up so you're not the tallest one.  For kids concerned about their height, there are two big questions:   When will I grow taller (or stop growing)?  How tall will I be?   Your genes , which you inherited from your parents, largely determine how tall you will end up being and how fast you'll grow. Kids get taller more quickly during growth spurts, times when their bodies grow fast — as much as 4 inches or more in a year during puberty , for example! When Does Height Happen?  Your biggest growth spurt happened when you were a baby. In that first year of life, you grew about 10 inches as you got bigger and stronger. Since then, you've probably seen your height increase a few inches a year. You might find out how much you've grown during your annual checkup at the doctor's office or when your pants get too short. Uh, oh — we can see your ankles!  After babyhood, the next big growth spurt for kids comes during puberty, a time of many changes when boys and girls grow bigger and start to look more like adult men and women. But no one can tell you exactly when you'll experience these changes.  Puberty starts at different ages for different kids and it is a process that takes a couple of years. So the getting taller part will happen at different ages, depending on the kid, and whether he or she is a boy or a girl.  In general, puberty starts:   between ages 8 and 13 in girls  between 9 and 15 in boys   During puberty, boys and girls will have a growth spurt and grow to their adult height. So that means girls who start puberty the latest will still be getting taller in their mid-teens. For boys, the latest to reach puberty will still be getting taller into their late teens. A few of these boys may grow taller even into their early twenties! How Tall Will I Be?  You might want to know how tall you will be. Will you be nose to nose with your mom or dad someday? There's no way to know for sure how tall a kid will be as an adult, but it's easy to get a clue: Look at your parents and the other adult members of your family. How tall are they? Chances are you'll be around the same height as your parents. If one parent is tall and one short, then you're likely to end up somewhere in between.  But you could be taller or shorter, too. Boy, there are a lot of "buts" when it comes to height! That's because your height is determined by your genes — the complicated code of instructions that you inherit from your parents. Genes tell your body how to grow and determine lots of things, including how tall you are.  But those genes don't make you an exact copy of your mom or dad. Kids only get some of the genes from each of their parents, and parents don't give the same bunch of their genes to each kid. If you have brothers and sisters, you know this is true. Brothers and sisters can look very different even though you have the same parents. Even identical twins can end up being different heights!  Height-Related Worries  Here are some things some short or tall kids might have to deal with:  You're too short to ride the rides you want to ride at an amusement park.  This one is upsetting. You're all ready to board the super-fast roller coaster and the ride operator says you're too small. Sometimes, you will be allowed to ride with an adult, so try to have one handy.  You still have to use a booster seat in the car.  Though you haven't used a car seat for a long time, older kids are supposed to use a booster seat until they are 4-feet-9-inches tall. The seats are meant to position the seat belt properly in case of a crash. If your friends don't have to use one and you do, you might feel funny about it. On the plus side, sitting higher makes it easier to see and might help if you get carsick and need to keep looking out the window.  You're a girl who's taller than the boys.  This can make a girl feel awkward, especially when it comes time to be paired up, like at a school dance. Eventually, this evens out, but it takes a little while because many girls have their growth spurts before the boys do.  Someone teases you about being too tall or too short.  This kind of teasing is the worst. You can't change your height, so what are you supposed to do? As with most teasing, try not to let it bother you. Tell a teacher, parent, or another adult if it's bothering you and the person won't stop . What Can I Do Right Now?  If you are still worried about your height, talk to your parents and your doctor. Most kids don't have a growth problem that needs help from a doctor, but it's always OK to ask if you're concerned.  So for most kids, it seems like there's not much to do but wait to see how it all turns out. But you can do something right now: Eat healthy and take care of yourself. If you get the nutrition, sleep, and exercise you need, you're likely to reach your maximum potential height. In other words, you'll grow as tall as you were meant to grow.  And even though you may hear people say it, taking extra vitamins or supplements that you can buy in a store won't help you get taller. Just stick to a healthy diet if you want to be the tallest you can be!  Kids who wish they weren't so tall should still eat healthy and take care of themselves, of course. Eating less won't make you end up any shorter unless you really starved yourself and made yourself sick.  As they get older, most kids learn to feel comfortable with their height, whether they turn out tall, short, or somewhere in between.

Phenotypic variance is the addition of the enviornmental variance and the genetic variance (and their covariance). In other words, the environment, not only the genes influence someone's height. This is one reason that may explain why an offsrping may be taller that their parents. – Remi.b  Oct 15 '14 at 15:24        4      If it were true, wouldn't it likewise be true that no child could be shorter than their shorter parent?

Anecdotally: I'm 185 cm, my parents are 155 cm and 178 cm. Joakim Noah , an NBA basketball player is 211 cm, his dad was 193 cm and mother was 175 cm ... how?  Genetics and environment play a role in determining height. First of all, a more nutritious environment during development can lead to increased height, this is one reason why more recent generations appear to be taller.  Height is also an example of a quantitative trait - this means many genes (or loci [singular is locus], locations in the DNA) affect the phenotype (the physical measurable result i.e. a persons height). It is infact how the vast majority of traits are determined. At each locus that affects height there may be polymorphism (when more than one allele, or variant of that gene, exists).  Example:  Suppose height entirely is determined by 2 additive loci, $A$ and $B$, and no environmental effect occurs, and there is diploidy (two of each locus, one from each parent, determines height in a person).  Each locus has two alleles denoted by $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1 $ and $B_2$. Each copy of alleles $A_1$ and $B_1$ add 40 cm to a persons height, $A_2$ and $B_2$ add 50 cm to a persons height.  Now a man who is $A_1 A_1, B_1 B_2$ (remember, humans are diploid) and a woman who is $A_2 A_1, B_1 B_1$ have children. Both parents are 170 cm tall. The theoretical limits for the population would be 160 cm and 200 cm. The children will inherit one copy of $A_1$ from the father and $B_1$ from the mother, but they could inherit either $B_1$ or $B_2$ from the father and either $A_1$ or $A_2$ from the mother. If a child inherited both of the taller alleles then they would be taller than the parents ($A_1 A_2, B_1 B_2$ = 180 cm). Likewise some offspring could be shorter.  Of course the reality is much more complex; height is determined by many more than 2 loci, by the environment, and gene * environment interactions. This principle was a hugely important because it meant that reproduction did not necessarily remove variation from the gene pool (a fundamental problem with early evolutionary theory was the thought of "blending" - when offspring are the average of their parents)     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 15:15             answered Oct 15 '14 at 15:08       Ell   13.8k 4 49 93              add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Yes, people can definitely grow taller than their parents. Height is a polygenic quantitative trait (so affected by many genes), that is also strongly affected by environmental factors. You are also forgetting that there is a sex difference in height (~14 cm, Wright & Cheetham, 1999 ), so the height of the mother does for instance not set an absolute cap on the height of her sons (" ....can't grow taller than either of their parents "), but her genetic background will influence their heights. If both parents are e.g. 180 cm tall, that is close to the population average for the father but considered tall for the mother, she is likely to carry genes that contribute to her offspring being tall.  That height is a polygenetic quantitative trait means that parental height will be a good predictor of offspring height, but with a wide scatter around the mean. Normally, 90% of children fall within 1.5 standard deviations of their midparental heights, after being sex-adjusted with +- 7cm for boys and girls ( Wright & Cheetham, 1999 ). For simplicity, it is often said that 90% of children will fall within 10cm of the sex-adjusted mid-parental height. However, the deviations are smaller if the parents are unusually short or tall, representing "regression to the mean", and parental height is a poorer predictor for offspring height in these cases. Using the midparent mean as a predictor of offspring height is otherwise standard practice, as can be seen in online applications (e.g. http://medcalc3000.com/HeightPotential.htm ). Using the same example as above, with both parents being 180 cm, will predict an offspring height of 186cm for sons and 174cm for daughters.  That height is strongly influenced by nutrition has been clearly shown in the general secular trend in body height in developed countries over the last centuries ( Cole, 2003 , where the average height of successive generations have been taller than their parents. For instance, the average height in the Netherlands have increased from 165 cm in 1860 to 181 cm in 1990 (numbers from Cole, 2003 ). Some of the online height calculators you see will also include a corrections for this, and add e.g. 1-2 cm to the mid-parent heights before correcting for sex.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 20 '16 at 20:57             answered Aug 12 '15 at 9:14       fileunderwater   14k 3 37 77              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Yes it is quite possible, recall nature vs nurture. I myself am slightly taller than both of my parents by about a head. As long as you have sufficient nutrition it should be quite possible.  And what you said about gene activation skipping generations is quite true- it can indeed happen, and if the gene responsible for height is not expressed in the parents but is in their offspring then it will also be more likely for the child to grow taller than their parent.     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 0:48             answered Oct 15 '14 at 0:38       Sherlock Holmes   127 6              add a comment |         protected by Chris ♦  Aug 12 '15 at 6:06   Thank you for your interest in this question.

This could be because of the old cliché, "The grass is always greener on the other side." In fact, it is surely because of this. However, whatever the reason is that a shorter person would like to be taller; there are some methods that have proven effective in accomplishing this feat.  Why Do People Want to Be Taller?   The truth of the matter is being tall can be a benefit for a number of reasons. For women, being tall may mean the opportunity to do something like runway modeling. For men it could just help their self confidence as they would find themselves taller than the women they date. One of the main complaints from shorter men is that all the women they meet are taller than them. Of course this is not entirely true as there are obviously quite a few short women in the world but the general point is clear. In addition, if you are a shorter person then reaching objects that others can easily reach can be a very challenging task for you. These are just some of the reasons that people want to find ways to become taller.  Surgical Limb Lengthening  There is a procedure which is called the Llizarov method of limb lengthening through a series of surgical procedures. Basically what this entails is having the bone in the lower leg, also known as the tibia cut and lengthened at a rate of about one millimeter per day. During the time that this method is being used leg braces are in place to support your legs and allow time for recovery. This method can be quite painful and can take a good amount of time from start to finish. For more information about this type of limb lengthening it would be best to discuss the matter with your physician.  Shoes That Add Height  One obvious way of appearing taller is to wear shoes that add to your height. Women have been doing it for years with high heeled shoes. However, there are special shoes made for men as well. These shoes generally have a thicker sole area that cannot be detected at a glance. This means that most people would not even be aware of the fact that lift shoes are being worn. These shoes are a great alternative if you are going to be out and about but of course they are not a permanent solution unless you intend to wear your shoes at all times which is most unlikely.  Nutrition for Kids  While height is in most cases going to be determined based on genetics, there are some things to consider when dealing with children and how tall they will grow. A child must have a well balanced diet comprised of all of the essential vitamins and minerals that are required in order for him/her to grow to his/her full potential. Surprisingly many people are deficient in some of the most important vitamins to aid in height. For example, Vitamin A and Vitamin B1 are commonly overlooked. This is why a good supplement for children including these as well as calcium, phosphorus, potassium and other basic minerals and vitamins is so very important. These supplements can be easily purchased at any drug store or even at most local grocery stores. In addition, children should eat several servings of fresh fruits and vegetables everyday with a good amount of foods that are rich in protein.  Good Posture  Almost all of us have had an elder such as a grandparent tell us to sit up straight and stop slouching. Well, there is a good reason for this. Believe it or not poor posture can actually minimize your potential height! Practice stretching your torso straight up when you walk, stand or sit. If you find that there is a problem with your posture see a doctor right away. Parents if your kids continuously slouch when they sit correct them immediately and explain to them that doing this may actually cause them problems later in life. Good posture is essential to growing as tall as is genetically possible.  Do Daily Stretching Exercises  There are some exercises that are designed to help elongate the spine and these exercises should be done every day. One exercise that works like a charm is to stand in a door way and reach as far as you can. Trying to touch the top of the frame then bend straight down and try placing the palms of your hands flat on the ground. Repeat this exercises several times daily. The idea is to feel pulling in your upper back. If you do not feel as thought you are stretching your back upward then there is a possibility that you are not doing to exercise properly.  Use a Firm Mattress  Studies have shown that people who sleep on firm mattresses, using no pillow at all have helped them to grow a bit taller as it keeps the posture straight. The reason for this is that your vertical discs are not under pressure and this allows them to expand. By using a series of stretching exercises and sleeping on a firm mattress you will help to keep the discs and vertebrae in your back straight. This will help you to achieve the most ideal height. In addition, any activity such as lifting should be done in the correct manner by using the knees to lift rather than the back. This will help you to avoid back injuries which could affect your height.  In reality, unless you are to undergo some sort of surgical procedure you are not going to manipulate more than an inch or two by using natural methods to increase your height. Height is something that is passed down genetically. If you have a very tall father and a very tall mother, you have a very good chance of becoming tall yourself. If you have a short father and a short mother but had a very tall grandfather you still may wind up being taller than both of your parents. Genetics, no matter how many generations you are looking at will play a vital role in the ultimate height you achieve.

Even if they eat perfect and do a lot of sports, if it is in their genes to become short then nothing will change that. My father is 5.9, my mother is 5.3 and my height (before LL) was 5.7, even though I was eating right and have an athletic body. So stop talking bs about eating and all these, if your genes are to make you short, then you'll be short no matter what you eat or anything else. If my boy became short and have a problem with that (because in reality there is nothing bad in being short), then I will do the best for him to have a completely successful LL and have a normal height. If my girl is short though, I won't support her to do LL unless she is very very short (less than 5ft). Because height prejudice is dominant only in men, not in women, so she could a lot of other things to impove her appearance without doing a so risky and hard surgery like LL. If that was the case then everyone would have been short, Our genes change all the time. I believe people have been doing LL for a very long time. It makes me wonder, why are some people short, I know its in their genes, but who was the first short person, to pass his genes to next generation, and how did he even get short?   wish177 : Quote from: ilizarovgirl on July 20, 2015, 08:33:46 PM you mean getting married to someone as your 'new height'? it's mostly genes that determine your height but it's kinda of formula that exists: for a baby girl= (your original height+your wife's height-5inches)/2 for a baby boy= (your original height+your wife's height+5inches)/2 For example, 160 is Dads original height and Moms is 175. Then average is(175+160-12.7)/2= 161.15 for a daughter and for a boy it's 173.85. But because its up to genetics your kids final height can be a little more than that if they get genes from your wife/her parents or less if they got genes from your side(that's what Doc said to me). Following that formula above I should grow up to 164cm. But because I got genes from my short grandparents I stopped to grow at 151cm. So people will keep getting shorter?   wish177 : Quote from: Camoflazh9306 on July 21, 2015, 06:57:08 AM If you have a boy he will be roughly the same height as his father, if you have a girl then she'll be roughly the same height as her mother. There are exceptions though, but it's largely based on genes. Sometimes a "tall" gene can resurface after many decades from either the mother's or father's side and give their child above average height. External factors that can influence height are sports such as basketball and swimming, getting enough sleep, eating enough healthy food. LOL, if I ever have kids I'm going to make sure they learn from an early age to get into those sports, eat healthy and all that. I'll tell them my story of LL which I will hopefully have completed by the time when (and if) I have kids. I'll purposely include all cringe-inducing details like how my legs were broken on purpose during surgery, and how I had screws drilled into my leg bones, and all that. And I'll finish with "If you don't want to end up like daddy did when he was younger, start eating everything mommy cooks for you and start exercising and playing sports." That should get them to listen, hahaha. I don't think swimming and playing basketball is gonna help your kids to grow taller, its like trying to stretch a tree   MyLongerLegs : Quote from: wish177 on July 21, 2015, 05:36:48 PM So people will keep getting shorter? No, why shorter? But it may be similar like with blood types(but with blood its more predictable than with height) you can have blood type A if genotype is 1. I^A x I^A 2. I^A x i where I^A is dominative for blood type A and 'i' means allele for blood type '0'. So 2 different genotypes but the same blood type. But in case 2 allele for blood type '0' is present so kids of such parents have chances to have type '0'. If both parents have genotype 2(so both have blood type A) there is 25% chance their kid will have blood type '0'. But if parent 2 cross with parent who has group '0'(then genotype is ii) there is 50% of chances kids will have blood type '0'. I was studying extended Biology and we were doing genetic crosses. But our teacher kept saying it's just 'theory' because in real life parents with blood type A can have 2 kids with blood type '0' so it will be 100% kids whilst chances were 50%/  So I am always imagining the same thing is with our height. Some genes will dominate other ones. So if genes from tall parent will dominate genes from short parent kids will be tall too but there will be 'short' allele left. And though person is short gene is still there. So if this tall person will have kids with somebody short there are quite high chances kids will be short too.    Body Builder : Quote from: wish177 on July 21, 2015, 05:35:18 PM If that was the case then everyone would have been short, Our genes change all the time. I believe people have been doing LL for a very long time. It makes me wonder, why are some people short, I know its in their genes, but who was the first short person, to pass his genes to next generation, and how did he even get short? You haven't understood what I meant. I said that if you have have "short" genes then you'll become short no matter what you do. If you have "tall" genes you'll become tall even if you don't eat good, not sleep a lot etc. The only thing you can do to improve your height is taking HGH and that only in the case you lack of it (like Lionel Messi).  A healthy kid won't become taller if it has no lack of HGH by using this hormone. So, genes play the dominant role in people's heights. The only way to overcome natural height is LL. Nothing else.

Are children usually taller than their parents? A. The results vary from child to child and family to family, and depend on genes and environmental factors, especially nutrition. Doctors often use a fairly simple formula to predict the adult height of a child based on the heights of the parents. That formula, dating from 1970 research, predicts that most (but not all) children eventually will reach a height somewhere within a fairly small range that can be estimated by the average combined height of their parents. For boys , the formula combines the height of both parents, adds five inches (or 13 centimeters) and divides by two. For girls , it combines the height of the parents, subtracts five inches and divides by two. A more complex formula accounts for extremes in parental height. Obviously, not all children of the same parents, nor even those of the same sex, end up the same height. Adult height tends to decrease in younger siblings , and younger children may grow more slowly . Other factors are involved in growing taller , most notably nutrition, but genetics is estimated to account for 60 percent to 80 percent of one’s final height. A 2000 study of 8,798 pairs of adult Finnish twins, published in the journal Behavior Genetics, found that heritability accounted for around 78 percent of height in adult men and 75 percent in women . question@nytimes.com   A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: The Main Measuring Stick for Height.

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       Hey, why do some people get a lot taller than their parents? And why am I a natural athlete and my parents are totally different? My hair is kinda the same as theirs but my eyes are way different. Please explain.        -A middle school student from Tennessee   March 9, 2005  We often hear that a child is the "spitting image" of one of their parents. An identical carbon copy, a couple decades younger.  How is it then that some of us end up being so different from our parents? The way we look, our interests, and our abilities just don't seem to reflect them at all.  There is no single explanation for the differences we see between generations. Several factors play a part.  Genes have a starring role in determining our physical attributes. For instance, a single gene decides if we can roll our tongue into a tube. Two genes determine our base eye color as brown, blue, or green ( /ask/ask2 ).  Unfortunately, the genetics governing most of our traits is not nearly as simple. Nor as well understood. This is because most traits utilize not just one or two genes, but many genes, to make us the way we are.  When lots of genes are at work, as with height and skin color, we see an entire spectrum of the trait across the population. For example, there aren't just tall people and short people. There are people of all heights falling anywhere between tall and short.  Figuring out which genes are responsible for these "many-gene" traits is challenging. Scientists have identified a few genes that are thought to be involved in our height. Although the exact number is not known, they estimate that as few as 7 to more than 20 genes may be working together on our stature. With so many players in the "height game", it is no wonder we vary so much from one another.  This explains why we may not stand eye to eye with our friends. But what about the differences we see in our own families?  As you mentioned, some children are considerably taller than their parents. Basketball legend, Wilt Chamberlain, was a towering 7'1". Strangely, neither of his parents stood above 5'9". Of course, children can be much shorter than their parents, too.  So how do a bunch of genes work together to determine our height?  Let's say, for the sake of simplicity, only three genes control our height. We will call them A , B , and C . An uppercase letter, like A , means "tall". A lowercase letter, like a , means "short".  Remember that we have two copies of every gene, one from dad and one from mom. Keeping that in mind, we would have 6 copies of these 3 genes. Our final height is then an average of the number of "tall" and "short" copies we inherit.  For an example, let's take a father whose gene makeup is AaBbCc and a mother with aaBBCc . With 3 "tall" and 3 "short" copies each, both are of average height. How tall will their kids grow?  Which copy of each gene we inherit from our parents is random. In this family, the children will most likely inherit 3 "tall" and 3 "short" copies. Like their parents, they will be average height. But this will not always be the case.  There is a smaller chance that their child could inherit five "tall" copies, ABC from dad and aBC from mom. This child will be quite tall. On the other hand, dad could pass down abc and mom could pass down aBc . With five "short" copies, this child would be considerably shorter.  Imagine how many possibilities there would be if twenty genes controlled our height!  All the burden of our stature cannot be placed solely on our genes. Many factors contribute to our final adult height. These are called Environmental Effects. They act on our "genetic height" to make us taller or shorter.  Some of these factors are at work very early, before we are even born! A mother's health while she is pregnant is thought to be a key player. Poor diet and toxic substances, like alcohol and nicotine, can be harmful to the growth of her child.  After we are born, healthy eating habits are vital in reaching our maximum height. Avoiding drugs, environmental pollutants, and childhood illnesses is important. As is getting enough exercise and sleep.  Many of our traits follow a similar pattern. They are a blending of lots of different genes as well as our environment.  Is this also true regarding how athletic we are? Sure. As we just talked about, our genes are important in designing our bodies. Height is important for success in sports like basketball and gymnastics. Endurance and lean muscles are critical to a long distance runner.  But even at seven feet tall, you may not excel at basketball. Many things can affect how successful we are at different activities.  Do we enjoy the activity? Are there local teams or clubs that we can join to help us practice? As the old adage says, practice makes perfect!  Do we have strong interests in other areas, like music or art, which limit our time? Can we afford to do the activity? Downhill skiing, photography, and painting are expensive hobbies.  There are many reasons that we are the way we are. Our genes make a significant contribution. But our lifestyle is important, too!

Short parents tend to have short children, and tall parents tend to have tall children. Some people wonder if a boy's height is determined primarily by his father's height whereas a girl's height is determined primarily by her mother's. This turns out not to be true. The height of a child is influenced by the heights of both parents. You may recall from school that some genetic traits are dominant while others are recessive, and so you might wonder whether tall stature is dominant over short stature or vice versa. In other words, if one parent is tall and the other is short, will the children tend to be short or tall? The answer turns out to be more complicated. Stature is determined by many different genes, and therefore it is neither dominant nor recessive. Each child gets a unique, complex combination of stature-determining genes from his or her parents. If one parent is tall and the other short, the child's stature can be similar to the mother's or the father's, but usually is in between the two. Occasionally, the random assortment of genes can even produce a child who is substantially shorter or taller than both parents.  Child Target Height  If we know the heights of both parents, we can make an educated guess about the height that their child will attain as an adult. This educated guess is called the target height or adjusted midparental height. Target height can be calculated as follows: For a boy, 1. Start with his mother's height. 2. Add 5 inches (or 13 cm). 3. Then add his father's height. 4. Divide by 2. For a girl, 1. Start with her father's height. 2. Subtract 5 inches (or 13 cm). 3. Then add her mother's height. 4. Divide by 2. In case you're curious, the 5 inches represents the difference in height between the average man (5 feet, 9 1/2 inches) and the average woman (5 feet, 4 1/2 inches). For a boy, we add 5 inches to his mother's height to take into account the fact that she is female. Adding 5 inches gives us the male equivalent of her height. Then we take that gender-adjusted height and average it with the father's height. So if a 5-foot, 8-inch man marries a 5-foot, 1-inch woman, we would estimate that their sons would be, on average, about 5 feet, 7 inches (61 inches + 5 inches + 68 inches = 134 inches. 134 2 = 67 inches), and we would estimate that their daughters would be, on average, about 5 feet, 2 inches (68 inches - 5 inches + 61 inches = 124 inches. 124 2 = 62 inches). If you are not fond of mathematical formulas, you can use table 2 to convert the parents' height from feet and inches into inches. Then to determine your child's target height, use table 3 for boys or table 4 for girls. Look along the left-hand margin of the table to find the father's height. Then look along the top margin of the table to find the mother's height. Follow the column corresponding to the mother's height until it intersects the row corresponding to the father's height. The intersection represents the target height of the child. Actually, the target height exaggerates the impact of parental height a bit. If the parents are tall, the children tend to be not quite as tall as their target height would predict, and if the parents are short, their children tend to be not quite as short as their target height would predict. Again, remember that the target height is just a rough estimate. If it were exact, then all the boys in a family would be the same height, as would all the girls, and we know that this is not true. In reality, each child gets a different, random assortment of genes from the parents and so can end up taller or shorter than the parents. The majority of children end up within 2 inches of their target height, but it is not unusual for individual children to end up as much as 4 inches taller or shorter than their target height. Also, nongenetic factors, such as nutrition, play a role. If a child's nutrition is better than the nutrition her parents received in childhood, then she will probably exceed her target height. On the other hand, if she has a significant illness that interferes with growth, she may not achieve her target height.  Ethnicity  Certain ethnic groups tend to be tall or short. A striking example is the African Pygmy; adult men are approximately 4 feet, 11 inches, and women approximately 4 feet, 8 inches. For most ethnic groups, the tendency to be tall or short is partly genetic and partly nongenetic. For instance, in the Netherlands the average height for young men is approximately 6 feet, and the average height for young women is approximately 5 feet, 7 inches. This tall stature presumably reflects a favorable environment, including good nutrition and good medical care, and a tall gene pool. In the United States, Caucasian and African Americans have similar heights. Caucasian and African American young men average approximately 5 feet, 10 inches, and young women average approximately 5 feet, 4 1/2 inches. Mexican Americans tend to be shorter. Mexican American young men average approximately 5 feet, 7 inches, and young women approximately 5 feet, 2 inches.  Single Genes That Can Affect Growth  As we discussed, many genes normally act in combination to determine height. Occasionally, however, a mutation in one single gene can have a powerful influence on growth. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. For example, a mutation in one gene (called FGF receptor-3) causes a condition called achondroplasia, in which the growth of the arms and legs is markedly reduced, and the adult height is decreased by about 16 inches. Mutations are often inherited from one or both parents. Specific genetic disorders that cause short stature will be discussed in chapter 7.  Chromosomes and Growth  In addition to mutations in specific growth-determining genes, we know that missing an entire chromosome, as occurs in girls with Turner syndrome, or having an extra chromosome, as occurs in Down syndrome, can have a negative influence on growth.  Key Points to Keep in Mind  Height is influenced by multiple genes. We can use the parents' heights to calculate a child's target height-the height that we would expect the child to attain-but it is just an educated guess. Different ethnic groups tend to be taller or shorter. Occasionally, a mutation in a single gene can strongly affect growth. Although genetics has a powerful effect on growth, it is just half the story. The other half is the environment, that is, the circumstances in which the child is raised.

Keywords: body , gene , growing up , inheritance    Asked by sampalmer16 to Elaine , Heather , Keith on 27 Jun 2013.              0    Heather Eyre answered on 27 Jun 2013:   Well nutrition plays a big role in height, and there is an excess of food available in developed countries now so there are now growth limits caused by the lack of nutrients any more.  The genes you inherit are a mixture of both parents, who were a mixture of their parents. So it gets a little more complicated than both my parents are tall so I will be tall! And lot of genes are involved!  For example:  My Mum is short (5ft0), and my Grandad but my Grandma is tall. My Dad is average (5ft11), with a Short Mum and average Dad.  I’m short (5ft3) but my Sister is 5ft8 and my brother is 6ft2 !              0    Keith Siew answered on 27 Jun 2013:   Height is a rather complex trait as heather pointed out! I’m 5’8″ and both my parents are shorter than me by a little… but my younger brother is probably 6’1″-6’2″… and all my male cousins on my Mom’s side are all 6’+… so I ended up being the shortest of the bunch (excluding my little cousins… but they’re just kids now so who knows how tall they’ll end up being).  But an interesting fact about height is that we as a species have been getting gradually taller over the decades/centuries! A lot of it has to do with availability of nutrition… but rather interestingly there seems to be a correlation between the well-being of a society and the height of its people… So while variation of height within a population has mostly to do with genetics… the variation between populations has to do with environment and as a results average height of a population can be used as a rough indicator of a society’s well-being… and for the record the people of the Netherlands have the tallest average height (6’1″ for males and 5’7″ for females)        Comments           Related Questions  Why do some people have faster reactions than others?

By Hayden Walles   Jenny Chisholm doesn’t mention whether she has a particular man and his mother in mind but she wonders about the truth of this. We’re well conditioned to expect a boy to outgrow his mother, and it’s probably even the usual result, but it isn’t a foregone conclusion.  The genetics of height are not simple. Old Gregor “fiddle-the-numbers” Mendel got a lot of press with his peas and their recessive and dominant genes. Some human characteristics like eye colour work this way, where a single gene, or at most a handful of genes, control a feature in a simple and predictable way. But there is no single gene controlling skin colour or height, instead a great number work together to produce the fine gradation in colour and height that we see around us.  It may help to imagine that there is one gene controlling the length of every little part of the body, each saying long or short. Your height then depends on the combination of all of the genes controlling the length of your spine and legs because they all contribute to a little bit of height.  If you let a mathematician get hold of that idea then they can tell you some interesting things. One is that a better prediction of your height comes not from the heights of your mother and father but from the average of their heights. It follows (you are following, aren’t you?) that a tall mother and a short father can expect to have children shorter than the mother but taller than the father. If only Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman hadn’t split before having any children of their own. That would have been a nice demonstration — what we in the science biz call a natural experiment.  A son can generally expect to be taller than his mother if his father is taller than his mother and our mores ensure this is generally the case. But this is a a cultural accident, not a biological law. The long and the short of it is that sons can be shorter than their mothers.   Posted Sat 10 Apr 2010.

By Jeannette Moninger, Photo by Ronnie Andren from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Such Great Heights         Ronnie Andren  Eight-year-old Sam Merritt can jump on his bed without worrying about hitting his head; he can squeeze into tight spaces during hide-and-seek; and he figures he'll never have to duck when he gets off the school bus. But he does have to listen to endless comments from strangers, classmates, and even relatives about his size. At 3'10", Sam looks more like a kindergartner than a third-grader. To make matters worse, his 4'2" twin sister, Amanda, is tall for her age. "People make the most insensitive remarks like, 'No, they can't be twins -- he looks like the little brother,'" says their dad, Scott, of Loganville, Georgia. "It bothers me, so it must get to him." Four-year-old Veronica Meyer, however, has inches to spare. The 4-foot-tall preschooler from Brooklyn is the same height as many 7-year-old girls. Her 2-year-old sister, Natalie, is tall too. "People ask what I feed them, like there's some super food for height," says their mother, Julie. "I'm nearly 6' and my husband is 6'2". Our daughters obviously inherited our tall genes, but people still feel the need to point out their size." Kids come in all shapes: tall or short, round or pencil thin. And they all want to fit in and be accepted. But when you're dwarfed by classmates -- or you tower above them -- fitting in can be more of a challenge. "Kids get teased about physical differences like height, weight, having a big nose, or wearing glasses. Unfortunately, people make a lot of judgments -- and a lot of thoughtless comments -- based on appearances," says Meredith Dreyer, PhD, a pediatric psychologist at Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, in Kansas City, Missouri. Measuring Up This fixation on size begins moments after your baby's born. Everyone wants to know his height and weight stats. From then on, the pediatrician will measure him at every checkup. While inches and pounds are important, growth is key. First developed 30 years ago, government growth charts gauge how his measurements compare with those of other kids of the same age and gender. "We don't worry as long as a child grows steadily, but an unusual jump in height or a sudden falloff in growth can be a sign of a health problem," says Elizabeth Littlejohn, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital. During his first year, your baby grows up to 10 inches in length. However, his early size isn't very predictive of his final height or weight. He'll add about five inches during his second year, and then starting at age 3, he'll grow about two and a half inches per year until a final growth spurt kicks in during puberty. Girls reach their adult height around 15 (the average American woman is 5'4"), while boys don't top out until 16 or 17 (the average American male is 5'9"). A school-age child who falls below the 5th percentile for height is considered to be of "short stature," a clinical term meaning he's shorter than 95 percent of kids his same age and gender, whereas a child who's in the 95th percentile is taller than all but a few of her peers. Average height is anywhere between the 40th and 60th percentiles. You can look at your family tree to figure out your child's future potential: Height is about 80 percent genetic. A child whose parents are both 6' is likely to be the tallest kid in kindergarten. If both parents are unusually short, their children probably will be short too. But even kids who have average-height or tall parents may inexplicably stop growing -- a condition known as idiopathic short stature (ISS). These children are significantly shorter than 99 percent of their peers, and will remain small as adults. "Boys generally won't grow to be more than 5'4", while the girls might hit 4'11"," says Dr. Littlejohn. Late bloomers, on the other hand, are small for their age but still growing at a normal rate and will eventually have a growth spurt and catch up to their peers. Short Stuff People often presume that short kids -- especially boys -- aren't as popular as tall kids and are often teased, bullied, or depressed about their size. However, one study of almost 1,000 middle- and high-schoolers found that height made little difference in how much classmates like each other. "Short kids tend to be well-adjusted and to have just as many friends as taller classmates," says study author David E. Sandberg, PhD, a pediatric psychologist at the University of Michigan Medical School, in Ann Arbor. "If these older kids are faring okay at a time when height differences are most noticeable and bullying is more of an issue, then younger kids who are short are probably fine too." Although the study's findings are encouraging, it can still be tough to be little -- particularly if you're a boy. "It's more socially acceptable for a girl to be small than for a boy to be short," says Dr. Dreyer. After all, girls are referred to in flattering ways -- petite, cute -- while boys tend to be called shrimp, shorty, or peewee. Even parents would rather have tall sons. One study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia found that boys are taken to growth specialists twice as often as girls are, even though boys aren't more prone to shortness. "Society views tall men as being strong, confident, and desirable, and parents of small boys don't want their sons to have a disadvantage in life," says study author Adda Grimberg, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. If your child's on the short side, it can be difficult for you to watch other kids, and even tactless adults, treat him differently because of his size -- especially if you had a similar experience when you were a kid. But if you're overly fixated on his height or get defensive when people comment about it, he could get the message that being small is bad or that his size defines him, says Dr. Grimberg. Instead, give your child the tools he needs to feel good about himself inside and out. Find areas where he can shine. Small kids can excel at lots of sports, including soccer, gymnastics, and martial arts. But if your child wants to play basketball or volleyball, encourage him to try it. Of course, there are also plenty of nonphysical activities he can get involved in, such as playing a musical instrument or acting in the school play. Problem-solve. If your child is being picked on, brainstorm solutions together and practice responses so she feels confident sticking up for herself. "Bullies want to get a rise out of their victim. When you don't react or you react unexpectedly, it takes away their fun," says Dr. Dreyer. Some deadpan replies for pint-size taunts: "Thanks a lot, I didn't know I was short" or "Wow, you're really observant." Encourage him to speak up. When people mistakenly assume that Ethan Udell is only 6 years old, the fourth-grader from Dix Hills, New York, quickly corrects them and gives them something else to talk about. "He tells people, 'I'm actually 9 1/2, and I'm a really good hockey player,'" says his mom, Stacey. Other upbeat responses to try: "Shortness is only one of my great qualities" or "I take after my grandfather." Respect her age. Don't say that your child is younger than she really is to get discounted tickets to movies or amusement parks. It might save you a few dollars, but it'll cost her self-esteem. High Anxiety Tall kids might seem to be on top of the world, but height has its downsides. Because they look older than their years, adults -- and even peers -- often expect them to behave more maturely. When Marissa Cooper, then 3, had a perfectly age-appropriate meltdown in a mall in Greenwood, Indiana, her mom, Heather, got snippy comments from strangers who assumed the girl was at least 5. "A woman said loudly to her friend, 'Isn't she a little old for tantrums?'" says Cooper. Now 6, Marissa is as tall as many 9-year-old girls, and that complicates playdates. Kids her age assume an "older" child won't want to play with them and are intimidated by her size, while kids her height find her too immature. "It's tough being a tall girl, and it just gets worse during the dating years," says Cooper, who's 5'8" and knows from her own childhood experience. Life's not a slam dunk for tall boys either. Adults generally expect that they're great at sports, but that's not necessarily true. Answering nonstop inquiries about his athletic abilities can be stressful for a child who's already tired of being singled out for his size. And then there's bullying. "When you're 8 but look 10, older kids like to challenge you. They'll say, 'So I bet you think you're as tough as me. Prove it,'" says Carleton Kendrick, a family therapist in Boston who was the tallest kid in his class. Still, tall kids have been known to throw their height around. A study at the University of Southern California found that both boys and girls who stand a mere half-inch taller than their peers at age 3 tend to be more aggressive by age 11. Experts speculate that tall boys and girls have higher testosterone levels, which contributes to aggressiveness. Or it could also be that tall kids learn early on to use force to get what they want. When your child gets sick of all the bean-stalk remarks, try these tactics. Take it as a compliment. Encourage your child to be proud of her height. Your daughter might say: "Thanks for noticing. I take after my dad," or "My grandma is tall too." Tell your own tall tales. Know what it's like to stick out in a crowd? Share what you liked about being a tall child: You could sit in the back row and still see over classmates' heads. You could ride anything at the amusement park. Rebound from stereotypes. Your child doesn't have to explain that he's not into basketball or other sports. He can just say, "No, I don't play," and mention what he does like to do: "I love to ride my bike," or "I'm really good at math." Whether your child is tall or short or somewhere in between, remind him that all kids are teased for some reason or another, suggests Dr. Dreyer. And try to help him see his height isn't such a huge deal. Where bigness really counts -- in terms of kindness, generosity, intelligence, and love -- is on the inside. Shots for Short Kids? About one in 3,500 children have growth-hormone deficiency, meaning they don't produce enough growth hormone for normal development and need daily injections of synthetic growth hormone to achieve something close to a normal height. In 2003, the FDA expanded approval for growth-hormone therapy to include the 1 percent of kids with idiopathic short stature (ISS). With treatment, children with ISS can gain an average of two to five inches depending on the cause of the slow growth and how many years they're in treatment. Studies have found that growth-hormone therapy is very safe for children. Side effects are rare and may include ear infections, muscle or joint pain, headaches, nausea, breast growth, and skin rashes. However, the treatment costs about $20,000 per year, with some kids needing it for five years or longer, and insurance doesn't always cover the cost.

Anecdotally: I'm 185 cm, my parents are 155 cm and 178 cm. Joakim Noah , an NBA basketball player is 211 cm, his dad was 193 cm and mother was 175 cm ... how?  Genetics and environment play a role in determining height. First of all, a more nutritious environment during development can lead to increased height, this is one reason why more recent generations appear to be taller.  Height is also an example of a quantitative trait - this means many genes (or loci [singular is locus], locations in the DNA) affect the phenotype (the physical measurable result i.e. a persons height). It is infact how the vast majority of traits are determined. At each locus that affects height there may be polymorphism (when more than one allele, or variant of that gene, exists).  Example:  Suppose height entirely is determined by 2 additive loci, $A$ and $B$, and no environmental effect occurs, and there is diploidy (two of each locus, one from each parent, determines height in a person).  Each locus has two alleles denoted by $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1 $ and $B_2$. Each copy of alleles $A_1$ and $B_1$ add 40 cm to a persons height, $A_2$ and $B_2$ add 50 cm to a persons height.  Now a man who is $A_1 A_1, B_1 B_2$ (remember, humans are diploid) and a woman who is $A_2 A_1, B_1 B_1$ have children. Both parents are 170 cm tall. The theoretical limits for the population would be 160 cm and 200 cm. The children will inherit one copy of $A_1$ from the father and $B_1$ from the mother, but they could inherit either $B_1$ or $B_2$ from the father and either $A_1$ or $A_2$ from the mother. If a child inherited both of the taller alleles then they would be taller than the parents ($A_1 A_2, B_1 B_2$ = 180 cm). Likewise some offspring could be shorter.  Of course the reality is much more complex; height is determined by many more than 2 loci, by the environment, and gene * environment interactions. This principle was a hugely important because it meant that reproduction did not necessarily remove variation from the gene pool (a fundamental problem with early evolutionary theory was the thought of "blending" - when offspring are the average of their parents)     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 15:15             answered Oct 15 '14 at 15:08       Ell   13.8k 4 49 93              add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      Yes, people can definitely grow taller than their parents. Height is a polygenic quantitative trait (so affected by many genes), that is also strongly affected by environmental factors. You are also forgetting that there is a sex difference in height (~14 cm, Wright & Cheetham, 1999 ), so the height of the mother does for instance not set an absolute cap on the height of her sons (" ....can't grow taller than either of their parents "), but her genetic background will influence their heights. If both parents are e.g. 180 cm tall, that is close to the population average for the father but considered tall for the mother, she is likely to carry genes that contribute to her offspring being tall.  That height is a polygenetic quantitative trait means that parental height will be a good predictor of offspring height, but with a wide scatter around the mean. Normally, 90% of children fall within 1.5 standard deviations of their midparental heights, after being sex-adjusted with +- 7cm for boys and girls ( Wright & Cheetham, 1999 ). For simplicity, it is often said that 90% of children will fall within 10cm of the sex-adjusted mid-parental height. However, the deviations are smaller if the parents are unusually short or tall, representing "regression to the mean", and parental height is a poorer predictor for offspring height in these cases. Using the midparent mean as a predictor of offspring height is otherwise standard practice, as can be seen in online applications (e.g. http://medcalc3000.com/HeightPotential.htm ). Using the same example as above, with both parents being 180 cm, will predict an offspring height of 186cm for sons and 174cm for daughters.  That height is strongly influenced by nutrition has been clearly shown in the general secular trend in body height in developed countries over the last centuries ( Cole, 2003 , where the average height of successive generations have been taller than their parents. For instance, the average height in the Netherlands have increased from 165 cm in 1860 to 181 cm in 1990 (numbers from Cole, 2003 ). Some of the online height calculators you see will also include a corrections for this, and add e.g. 1-2 cm to the mid-parent heights before correcting for sex.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 20 '16 at 20:57             answered Aug 12 '15 at 9:14       fileunderwater   14k 3 37 77              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Yes it is quite possible, recall nature vs nurture. I myself am slightly taller than both of my parents by about a head. As long as you have sufficient nutrition it should be quite possible.  And what you said about gene activation skipping generations is quite true- it can indeed happen, and if the gene responsible for height is not expressed in the parents but is in their offspring then it will also be more likely for the child to grow taller than their parent.     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 0:48             answered Oct 15 '14 at 0:38       Sherlock Holmes   127 6              add a comment |         protected by Chris ♦  Aug 12 '15 at 6:06   Thank you for your interest in this question.

It's in Your Genes When Does Height Happen? How Tall Will I Be? Height-Related Worries What Can I Do Right Now?     Print en español Sentirse demasiado alto o demasiado bajo "Line up shortest to tallest!" the teacher calls out. "Not again," some kids might groan — especially if they have to stand at one end or the other.  For most kids, height isn't something they can change, so what do you do if you don't like how tall or short you are? It might be girls feeling too tall and boys feeling too short. But some really tall boys might not like all that height and some shorter girls might get tired of all the jokes or of feeling like they're staying little while their friends are growing up.  It's in Your Genes  But the truth is that everyone is growing up — it's just that they're doing it at their own pace. In other words, your body grows on its own schedule. You can't wish yourself taller or stretch yourself. Or if you're already tall, you can't do anything to hurry your friends up so you're not the tallest one.  For kids concerned about their height, there are two big questions:   When will I grow taller (or stop growing)?  How tall will I be?   Your genes , which you inherited from your parents, largely determine how tall you will end up being and how fast you'll grow. Kids get taller more quickly during growth spurts, times when their bodies grow fast — as much as 4 inches or more in a year during puberty , for example! When Does Height Happen?  Your biggest growth spurt happened when you were a baby. In that first year of life, you grew about 10 inches as you got bigger and stronger. Since then, you've probably seen your height increase a few inches a year. You might find out how much you've grown during your annual checkup at the doctor's office or when your pants get too short. Uh, oh — we can see your ankles!  After babyhood, the next big growth spurt for kids comes during puberty, a time of many changes when boys and girls grow bigger and start to look more like adult men and women. But no one can tell you exactly when you'll experience these changes.  Puberty starts at different ages for different kids and it is a process that takes a couple of years. So the getting taller part will happen at different ages, depending on the kid, and whether he or she is a boy or a girl.  In general, puberty starts:   between ages 8 and 13 in girls  between 9 and 15 in boys   During puberty, boys and girls will have a growth spurt and grow to their adult height. So that means girls who start puberty the latest will still be getting taller in their mid-teens. For boys, the latest to reach puberty will still be getting taller into their late teens. A few of these boys may grow taller even into their early twenties! How Tall Will I Be?  You might want to know how tall you will be. Will you be nose to nose with your mom or dad someday? There's no way to know for sure how tall a kid will be as an adult, but it's easy to get a clue: Look at your parents and the other adult members of your family. How tall are they? Chances are you'll be around the same height as your parents. If one parent is tall and one short, then you're likely to end up somewhere in between.  But you could be taller or shorter, too. Boy, there are a lot of "buts" when it comes to height! That's because your height is determined by your genes — the complicated code of instructions that you inherit from your parents. Genes tell your body how to grow and determine lots of things, including how tall you are.  But those genes don't make you an exact copy of your mom or dad. Kids only get some of the genes from each of their parents, and parents don't give the same bunch of their genes to each kid. If you have brothers and sisters, you know this is true. Brothers and sisters can look very different even though you have the same parents. Even identical twins can end up being different heights!  Height-Related Worries  Here are some things some short or tall kids might have to deal with:  You're too short to ride the rides you want to ride at an amusement park.  This one is upsetting. You're all ready to board the super-fast roller coaster and the ride operator says you're too small. Sometimes, you will be allowed to ride with an adult, so try to have one handy.  You still have to use a booster seat in the car.  Though you haven't used a car seat for a long time, older kids are supposed to use a booster seat until they are 4-feet-9-inches tall. The seats are meant to position the seat belt properly in case of a crash. If your friends don't have to use one and you do, you might feel funny about it. On the plus side, sitting higher makes it easier to see and might help if you get carsick and need to keep looking out the window.  You're a girl who's taller than the boys.  This can make a girl feel awkward, especially when it comes time to be paired up, like at a school dance. Eventually, this evens out, but it takes a little while because many girls have their growth spurts before the boys do.  Someone teases you about being too tall or too short.  This kind of teasing is the worst. You can't change your height, so what are you supposed to do? As with most teasing, try not to let it bother you. Tell a teacher, parent, or another adult if it's bothering you and the person won't stop . What Can I Do Right Now?  If you are still worried about your height, talk to your parents and your doctor. Most kids don't have a growth problem that needs help from a doctor, but it's always OK to ask if you're concerned.  So for most kids, it seems like there's not much to do but wait to see how it all turns out. But you can do something right now: Eat healthy and take care of yourself. If you get the nutrition, sleep, and exercise you need, you're likely to reach your maximum potential height. In other words, you'll grow as tall as you were meant to grow.  And even though you may hear people say it, taking extra vitamins or supplements that you can buy in a store won't help you get taller. Just stick to a healthy diet if you want to be the tallest you can be!  Kids who wish they weren't so tall should still eat healthy and take care of themselves, of course. Eating less won't make you end up any shorter unless you really starved yourself and made yourself sick.  As they get older, most kids learn to feel comfortable with their height, whether they turn out tall, short, or somewhere in between.

However, the deviations are smaller if the parents are unusually short or tall, representing "regression to the mean", and parental height is a poorer predictor for offspring height in these cases. Using the midparent mean as a predictor of offspring height is otherwise standard practice, as can be seen in online applications (e.g. http://medcalc3000.com/HeightPotential.htm ). Using the same example as above, with both parents being 180 cm, will predict an offspring height of 186cm for sons and 174cm for daughters.  That height is strongly influenced by nutrition has been clearly shown in the general secular trend in body height in developed countries over the last centuries ( Cole, 2003 , where the average height of successive generations have been taller than their parents. For instance, the average height in the Netherlands have increased from 165 cm in 1860 to 181 cm in 1990 (numbers from Cole, 2003 ). Some of the online height calculators you see will also include a corrections for this, and add e.g. 1-2 cm to the mid-parent heights before correcting for sex.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 20 '16 at 20:57             answered Aug 12 '15 at 9:14       fileunderwater   14k 3 37 77              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Yes it is quite possible, recall nature vs nurture. I myself am slightly taller than both of my parents by about a head. As long as you have sufficient nutrition it should be quite possible.  And what you said about gene activation skipping generations is quite true- it can indeed happen, and if the gene responsible for height is not expressed in the parents but is in their offspring then it will also be more likely for the child to grow taller than their parent.     share | improve this answer      edited Oct 15 '14 at 0:48             answered Oct 15 '14 at 0:38       Sherlock Holmes   127 6              add a comment |         protected by Chris ♦  Aug 12 '15 at 6:06   Thank you for your interest in this question.

This could be because of the old cliché, "The grass is always greener on the other side." In fact, it is surely because of this. However, whatever the reason is that a shorter person would like to be taller; there are some methods that have proven effective in accomplishing this feat.  Why Do People Want to Be Taller?   The truth of the matter is being tall can be a benefit for a number of reasons. For women, being tall may mean the opportunity to do something like runway modeling. For men it could just help their self confidence as they would find themselves taller than the women they date. One of the main complaints from shorter men is that all the women they meet are taller than them. Of course this is not entirely true as there are obviously quite a few short women in the world but the general point is clear. In addition, if you are a shorter person then reaching objects that others can easily reach can be a very challenging task for you. These are just some of the reasons that people want to find ways to become taller.  Surgical Limb Lengthening  There is a procedure which is called the Llizarov method of limb lengthening through a series of surgical procedures. Basically what this entails is having the bone in the lower leg, also known as the tibia cut and lengthened at a rate of about one millimeter per day. During the time that this method is being used leg braces are in place to support your legs and allow time for recovery. This method can be quite painful and can take a good amount of time from start to finish. For more information about this type of limb lengthening it would be best to discuss the matter with your physician.  Shoes That Add Height  One obvious way of appearing taller is to wear shoes that add to your height. Women have been doing it for years with high heeled shoes. However, there are special shoes made for men as well. These shoes generally have a thicker sole area that cannot be detected at a glance. This means that most people would not even be aware of the fact that lift shoes are being worn. These shoes are a great alternative if you are going to be out and about but of course they are not a permanent solution unless you intend to wear your shoes at all times which is most unlikely.  Nutrition for Kids  While height is in most cases going to be determined based on genetics, there are some things to consider when dealing with children and how tall they will grow. A child must have a well balanced diet comprised of all of the essential vitamins and minerals that are required in order for him/her to grow to his/her full potential. Surprisingly many people are deficient in some of the most important vitamins to aid in height. For example, Vitamin A and Vitamin B1 are commonly overlooked. This is why a good supplement for children including these as well as calcium, phosphorus, potassium and other basic minerals and vitamins is so very important. These supplements can be easily purchased at any drug store or even at most local grocery stores. In addition, children should eat several servings of fresh fruits and vegetables everyday with a good amount of foods that are rich in protein.  Good Posture  Almost all of us have had an elder such as a grandparent tell us to sit up straight and stop slouching. Well, there is a good reason for this. Believe it or not poor posture can actually minimize your potential height! Practice stretching your torso straight up when you walk, stand or sit. If you find that there is a problem with your posture see a doctor right away. Parents if your kids continuously slouch when they sit correct them immediately and explain to them that doing this may actually cause them problems later in life. Good posture is essential to growing as tall as is genetically possible.  Do Daily Stretching Exercises  There are some exercises that are designed to help elongate the spine and these exercises should be done every day. One exercise that works like a charm is to stand in a door way and reach as far as you can. Trying to touch the top of the frame then bend straight down and try placing the palms of your hands flat on the ground. Repeat this exercises several times daily. The idea is to feel pulling in your upper back. If you do not feel as thought you are stretching your back upward then there is a possibility that you are not doing to exercise properly.  Use a Firm Mattress  Studies have shown that people who sleep on firm mattresses, using no pillow at all have helped them to grow a bit taller as it keeps the posture straight. The reason for this is that your vertical discs are not under pressure and this allows them to expand. By using a series of stretching exercises and sleeping on a firm mattress you will help to keep the discs and vertebrae in your back straight. This will help you to achieve the most ideal height. In addition, any activity such as lifting should be done in the correct manner by using the knees to lift rather than the back. This will help you to avoid back injuries which could affect your height.  In reality, unless you are to undergo some sort of surgical procedure you are not going to manipulate more than an inch or two by using natural methods to increase your height. Height is something that is passed down genetically. If you have a very tall father and a very tall mother, you have a very good chance of becoming tall yourself. If you have a short father and a short mother but had a very tall grandfather you still may wind up being taller than both of your parents. Genetics, no matter how many generations you are looking at will play a vital role in the ultimate height you achieve.

Even if they eat perfect and do a lot of sports, if it is in their genes to become short then nothing will change that. My father is 5.9, my mother is 5.3 and my height (before LL) was 5.7, even though I was eating right and have an athletic body. So stop talking bs about eating and all these, if your genes are to make you short, then you'll be short no matter what you eat or anything else. If my boy became short and have a problem with that (because in reality there is nothing bad in being short), then I will do the best for him to have a completely successful LL and have a normal height. If my girl is short though, I won't support her to do LL unless she is very very short (less than 5ft). Because height prejudice is dominant only in men, not in women, so she could a lot of other things to impove her appearance without doing a so risky and hard surgery like LL. If that was the case then everyone would have been short, Our genes change all the time. I believe people have been doing LL for a very long time. It makes me wonder, why are some people short, I know its in their genes, but who was the first short person, to pass his genes to next generation, and how did he even get short?   wish177 : Quote from: ilizarovgirl on July 20, 2015, 08:33:46 PM you mean getting married to someone as your 'new height'? it's mostly genes that determine your height but it's kinda of formula that exists: for a baby girl= (your original height+your wife's height-5inches)/2 for a baby boy= (your original height+your wife's height+5inches)/2 For example, 160 is Dads original height and Moms is 175. Then average is(175+160-12.7)/2= 161.15 for a daughter and for a boy it's 173.85. But because its up to genetics your kids final height can be a little more than that if they get genes from your wife/her parents or less if they got genes from your side(that's what Doc said to me). Following that formula above I should grow up to 164cm. But because I got genes from my short grandparents I stopped to grow at 151cm. So people will keep getting shorter?   wish177 : Quote from: Camoflazh9306 on July 21, 2015, 06:57:08 AM If you have a boy he will be roughly the same height as his father, if you have a girl then she'll be roughly the same height as her mother. There are exceptions though, but it's largely based on genes. Sometimes a "tall" gene can resurface after many decades from either the mother's or father's side and give their child above average height. External factors that can influence height are sports such as basketball and swimming, getting enough sleep, eating enough healthy food. LOL, if I ever have kids I'm going to make sure they learn from an early age to get into those sports, eat healthy and all that. I'll tell them my story of LL which I will hopefully have completed by the time when (and if) I have kids. I'll purposely include all cringe-inducing details like how my legs were broken on purpose during surgery, and how I had screws drilled into my leg bones, and all that. And I'll finish with "If you don't want to end up like daddy did when he was younger, start eating everything mommy cooks for you and start exercising and playing sports." That should get them to listen, hahaha. I don't think swimming and playing basketball is gonna help your kids to grow taller, its like trying to stretch a tree   MyLongerLegs : Quote from: wish177 on July 21, 2015, 05:36:48 PM So people will keep getting shorter? No, why shorter? But it may be similar like with blood types(but with blood its more predictable than with height) you can have blood type A if genotype is 1. I^A x I^A 2. I^A x i where I^A is dominative for blood type A and 'i' means allele for blood type '0'. So 2 different genotypes but the same blood type. But in case 2 allele for blood type '0' is present so kids of such parents have chances to have type '0'. If both parents have genotype 2(so both have blood type A) there is 25% chance their kid will have blood type '0'. But if parent 2 cross with parent who has group '0'(then genotype is ii) there is 50% of chances kids will have blood type '0'. I was studying extended Biology and we were doing genetic crosses. But our teacher kept saying it's just 'theory' because in real life parents with blood type A can have 2 kids with blood type '0' so it will be 100% kids whilst chances were 50%/  So I am always imagining the same thing is with our height. Some genes will dominate other ones. So if genes from tall parent will dominate genes from short parent kids will be tall too but there will be 'short' allele left. And though person is short gene is still there. So if this tall person will have kids with somebody short there are quite high chances kids will be short too.    Body Builder : Quote from: wish177 on July 21, 2015, 05:35:18 PM If that was the case then everyone would have been short, Our genes change all the time. I believe people have been doing LL for a very long time. It makes me wonder, why are some people short, I know its in their genes, but who was the first short person, to pass his genes to next generation, and how did he even get short? You haven't understood what I meant. I said that if you have have "short" genes then you'll become short no matter what you do. If you have "tall" genes you'll become tall even if you don't eat good, not sleep a lot etc. The only thing you can do to improve your height is taking HGH and that only in the case you lack of it (like Lionel Messi).  A healthy kid won't become taller if it has no lack of HGH by using this hormone. So, genes play the dominant role in people's heights. The only way to overcome natural height is LL. Nothing else.

Are children usually taller than their parents? A. The results vary from child to child and family to family, and depend on genes and environmental factors, especially nutrition. Doctors often use a fairly simple formula to predict the adult height of a child based on the heights of the parents. That formula, dating from 1970 research, predicts that most (but not all) children eventually will reach a height somewhere within a fairly small range that can be estimated by the average combined height of their parents. For boys , the formula combines the height of both parents, adds five inches (or 13 centimeters) and divides by two. For girls , it combines the height of the parents, subtracts five inches and divides by two. A more complex formula accounts for extremes in parental height. Obviously, not all children of the same parents, nor even those of the same sex, end up the same height. Adult height tends to decrease in younger siblings , and younger children may grow more slowly . Other factors are involved in growing taller , most notably nutrition, but genetics is estimated to account for 60 percent to 80 percent of one’s final height. A 2000 study of 8,798 pairs of adult Finnish twins, published in the journal Behavior Genetics, found that heritability accounted for around 78 percent of height in adult men and 75 percent in women . question@nytimes.com   A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: The Main Measuring Stick for Height.

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       Hey, why do some people get a lot taller than their parents? And why am I a natural athlete and my parents are totally different? My hair is kinda the same as theirs but my eyes are way different. Please explain.        -A middle school student from Tennessee   March 9, 2005  We often hear that a child is the "spitting image" of one of their parents. An identical carbon copy, a couple decades younger.  How is it then that some of us end up being so different from our parents? The way we look, our interests, and our abilities just don't seem to reflect them at all.  There is no single explanation for the differences we see between generations. Several factors play a part.  Genes have a starring role in determining our physical attributes. For instance, a single gene decides if we can roll our tongue into a tube. Two genes determine our base eye color as brown, blue, or green ( /ask/ask2 ).  Unfortunately, the genetics governing most of our traits is not nearly as simple. Nor as well understood. This is because most traits utilize not just one or two genes, but many genes, to make us the way we are.  When lots of genes are at work, as with height and skin color, we see an entire spectrum of the trait across the population. For example, there aren't just tall people and short people. There are people of all heights falling anywhere between tall and short.  Figuring out which genes are responsible for these "many-gene" traits is challenging. Scientists have identified a few genes that are thought to be involved in our height. Although the exact number is not known, they estimate that as few as 7 to more than 20 genes may be working together on our stature. With so many players in the "height game", it is no wonder we vary so much from one another.  This explains why we may not stand eye to eye with our friends. But what about the differences we see in our own families?  As you mentioned, some children are considerably taller than their parents. Basketball legend, Wilt Chamberlain, was a towering 7'1". Strangely, neither of his parents stood above 5'9". Of course, children can be much shorter than their parents, too.  So how do a bunch of genes work together to determine our height?  Let's say, for the sake of simplicity, only three genes control our height. We will call them A , B , and C . An uppercase letter, like A , means "tall". A lowercase letter, like a , means "short".  Remember that we have two copies of every gene, one from dad and one from mom. Keeping that in mind, we would have 6 copies of these 3 genes. Our final height is then an average of the number of "tall" and "short" copies we inherit.  For an example, let's take a father whose gene makeup is AaBbCc and a mother with aaBBCc . With 3 "tall" and 3 "short" copies each, both are of average height. How tall will their kids grow?  Which copy of each gene we inherit from our parents is random. In this family, the children will most likely inherit 3 "tall" and 3 "short" copies. Like their parents, they will be average height. But this will not always be the case.  There is a smaller chance that their child could inherit five "tall" copies, ABC from dad and aBC from mom. This child will be quite tall. On the other hand, dad could pass down abc and mom could pass down aBc . With five "short" copies, this child would be considerably shorter.  Imagine how many possibilities there would be if twenty genes controlled our height!  All the burden of our stature cannot be placed solely on our genes. Many factors contribute to our final adult height. These are called Environmental Effects. They act on our "genetic height" to make us taller or shorter.  Some of these factors are at work very early, before we are even born! A mother's health while she is pregnant is thought to be a key player. Poor diet and toxic substances, like alcohol and nicotine, can be harmful to the growth of her child.  After we are born, healthy eating habits are vital in reaching our maximum height. Avoiding drugs, environmental pollutants, and childhood illnesses is important. As is getting enough exercise and sleep.  Many of our traits follow a similar pattern. They are a blending of lots of different genes as well as our environment.  Is this also true regarding how athletic we are? Sure. As we just talked about, our genes are important in designing our bodies. Height is important for success in sports like basketball and gymnastics. Endurance and lean muscles are critical to a long distance runner.  But even at seven feet tall, you may not excel at basketball. Many things can affect how successful we are at different activities.  Do we enjoy the activity? Are there local teams or clubs that we can join to help us practice? As the old adage says, practice makes perfect!  Do we have strong interests in other areas, like music or art, which limit our time? Can we afford to do the activity? Downhill skiing, photography, and painting are expensive hobbies.  There are many reasons that we are the way we are. Our genes make a significant contribution. But our lifestyle is important, too!

Short parents tend to have short children, and tall parents tend to have tall children. Some people wonder if a boy's height is determined primarily by his father's height whereas a girl's height is determined primarily by her mother's. This turns out not to be true. The height of a child is influenced by the heights of both parents. You may recall from school that some genetic traits are dominant while others are recessive, and so you might wonder whether tall stature is dominant over short stature or vice versa. In other words, if one parent is tall and the other is short, will the children tend to be short or tall? The answer turns out to be more complicated. Stature is determined by many different genes, and therefore it is neither dominant nor recessive. Each child gets a unique, complex combination of stature-determining genes from his or her parents. If one parent is tall and the other short, the child's stature can be similar to the mother's or the father's, but usually is in between the two. Occasionally, the random assortment of genes can even produce a child who is substantially shorter or taller than both parents.  Child Target Height  If we know the heights of both parents, we can make an educated guess about the height that their child will attain as an adult. This educated guess is called the target height or adjusted midparental height. Target height can be calculated as follows: For a boy, 1. Start with his mother's height. 2. Add 5 inches (or 13 cm). 3. Then add his father's height. 4. Divide by 2. For a girl, 1. Start with her father's height. 2. Subtract 5 inches (or 13 cm). 3. Then add her mother's height. 4. Divide by 2. In case you're curious, the 5 inches represents the difference in height between the average man (5 feet, 9 1/2 inches) and the average woman (5 feet, 4 1/2 inches). For a boy, we add 5 inches to his mother's height to take into account the fact that she is female. Adding 5 inches gives us the male equivalent of her height. Then we take that gender-adjusted height and average it with the father's height. So if a 5-foot, 8-inch man marries a 5-foot, 1-inch woman, we would estimate that their sons would be, on average, about 5 feet, 7 inches (61 inches + 5 inches + 68 inches = 134 inches. 134 2 = 67 inches), and we would estimate that their daughters would be, on average, about 5 feet, 2 inches (68 inches - 5 inches + 61 inches = 124 inches. 124 2 = 62 inches). If you are not fond of mathematical formulas, you can use table 2 to convert the parents' height from feet and inches into inches. Then to determine your child's target height, use table 3 for boys or table 4 for girls. Look along the left-hand margin of the table to find the father's height. Then look along the top margin of the table to find the mother's height. Follow the column corresponding to the mother's height until it intersects the row corresponding to the father's height. The intersection represents the target height of the child. Actually, the target height exaggerates the impact of parental height a bit. If the parents are tall, the children tend to be not quite as tall as their target height would predict, and if the parents are short, their children tend to be not quite as short as their target height would predict. Again, remember that the target height is just a rough estimate. If it were exact, then all the boys in a family would be the same height, as would all the girls, and we know that this is not true. In reality, each child gets a different, random assortment of genes from the parents and so can end up taller or shorter than the parents. The majority of children end up within 2 inches of their target height, but it is not unusual for individual children to end up as much as 4 inches taller or shorter than their target height. Also, nongenetic factors, such as nutrition, play a role. If a child's nutrition is better than the nutrition her parents received in childhood, then she will probably exceed her target height. On the other hand, if she has a significant illness that interferes with growth, she may not achieve her target height.  Ethnicity  Certain ethnic groups tend to be tall or short. A striking example is the African Pygmy; adult men are approximately 4 feet, 11 inches, and women approximately 4 feet, 8 inches. For most ethnic groups, the tendency to be tall or short is partly genetic and partly nongenetic. For instance, in the Netherlands the average height for young men is approximately 6 feet, and the average height for young women is approximately 5 feet, 7 inches. This tall stature presumably reflects a favorable environment, including good nutrition and good medical care, and a tall gene pool. In the United States, Caucasian and African Americans have similar heights. Caucasian and African American young men average approximately 5 feet, 10 inches, and young women average approximately 5 feet, 4 1/2 inches. Mexican Americans tend to be shorter. Mexican American young men average approximately 5 feet, 7 inches, and young women approximately 5 feet, 2 inches.  Single Genes That Can Affect Growth  As we discussed, many genes normally act in combination to determine height. Occasionally, however, a mutation in one single gene can have a powerful influence on growth. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. For example, a mutation in one gene (called FGF receptor-3) causes a condition called achondroplasia, in which the growth of the arms and legs is markedly reduced, and the adult height is decreased by about 16 inches. Mutations are often inherited from one or both parents. Specific genetic disorders that cause short stature will be discussed in chapter 7.  Chromosomes and Growth  In addition to mutations in specific growth-determining genes, we know that missing an entire chromosome, as occurs in girls with Turner syndrome, or having an extra chromosome, as occurs in Down syndrome, can have a negative influence on growth.  Key Points to Keep in Mind  Height is influenced by multiple genes. We can use the parents' heights to calculate a child's target height-the height that we would expect the child to attain-but it is just an educated guess. Different ethnic groups tend to be taller or shorter. Occasionally, a mutation in a single gene can strongly affect growth. Although genetics has a powerful effect on growth, it is just half the story. The other half is the environment, that is, the circumstances in which the child is raised.

Keywords: body , gene , growing up , inheritance    Asked by sampalmer16 to Elaine , Heather , Keith on 27 Jun 2013.              0    Heather Eyre answered on 27 Jun 2013:   Well nutrition plays a big role in height, and there is an excess of food available in developed countries now so there are now growth limits caused by the lack of nutrients any more.  The genes you inherit are a mixture of both parents, who were a mixture of their parents. So it gets a little more complicated than both my parents are tall so I will be tall! And lot of genes are involved!  For example:  My Mum is short (5ft0), and my Grandad but my Grandma is tall. My Dad is average (5ft11), with a Short Mum and average Dad.  I’m short (5ft3) but my Sister is 5ft8 and my brother is 6ft2 !              0    Keith Siew answered on 27 Jun 2013:   Height is a rather complex trait as heather pointed out! I’m 5’8″ and both my parents are shorter than me by a little… but my younger brother is probably 6’1″-6’2″… and all my male cousins on my Mom’s side are all 6’+… so I ended up being the shortest of the bunch (excluding my little cousins… but they’re just kids now so who knows how tall they’ll end up being).  But an interesting fact about height is that we as a species have been getting gradually taller over the decades/centuries! A lot of it has to do with availability of nutrition… but rather interestingly there seems to be a correlation between the well-being of a society and the height of its people… So while variation of height within a population has mostly to do with genetics… the variation between populations has to do with environment and as a results average height of a population can be used as a rough indicator of a society’s well-being… and for the record the people of the Netherlands have the tallest average height (6’1″ for males and 5’7″ for females)        Comments           Related Questions  Why do some people have faster reactions than others?
