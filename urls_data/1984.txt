Families should seek counseling from a qualified physician or genetics clinic.)  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is the result of a mutation in one of the two genes that carry instructions for making type 1 collagen (the major protein in bone and skin). The mutation may result in either a change in the structure of type 1 collagen molecules, or in the number of collagen molecules made. Either of these changes results in weak bones that fracture easily.  In recent years, researchers have studied skin cells, the collagen molecules they make, and the genes themselves from individuals with different forms of OI. Results of these studies show that the great majority of people with OI, even those who are the only affected person in a family, have dominantly inherited forms of the disorder.  How Genes Work Genes are units of hereditary material (DNA) that tell the cells in our bodies how to function. We receive two copies of each gene--one from each parent. Most of the time, genes function the way they are supposed to. However, genes can sometimes be altered by a mutation , in which there is a change in the structure of the gene's DNA. When a mutation occurs, it can disrupt the normal function of a gene.  Dominant Inheritance Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta involve a dominant mutation . When a gene with a dominant mutation is paired with a normal gene, the faulty gene "dominates" the normal gene. In OI, a dominant genetic defect causes one of two things to occur:   The dominant altered gene directs cells to make an altered collagen protein. Even though the normal gene directs cells to make normal collagen, the presence of altered collagen causes Type II, III, or IV OI. These types result from a problem with the quality of collagen.  The dominant altered gene fails to direct cells to make any collagen protein. Although some collagen is produced by instructions from the normal gene, there is an overall decrease in the total amount of collagen produced, resulting in Type I OI. This type results from a problem with the quantity of collagen.  When a mutation is dominant, a person only has to receive one faulty gene to have a genetic disorder. This is the case with most people who have OI: they have one faulty gene for type 1 collagen, and one normal gene for type 1 collagen.  Recessive Inheritance With recessive inheritance, both copies of a gene must be defective for a person to have a genetic disorder. This occurs when both parents carry a single altered copy of the gene. The parents do not have the genetic disorder (because they have only one faulty gene), but they are carriers of the disorder. With each pregnancy, there is a 25 percent chance that the child will receive two altered genes, one from each parent. In this case, the child would have the genetic disorder. There is a 50 percent chance that the child will receive only one altered gene, in which case he or she will be a carrier (like his or her parents), but not have the disorder. Most researchers now agree that recessive inheritance rarely causes osteogenesis imperfecta.  OI in Families There are essentially three scenarios that occur to cause a child to be born with osteogenesis imperfecta.   Direct Inheritance from a Parent   A person with OI has two genes for type 1 collagen--one gene is faulty, the other is normal. Each time that person conceives a child, he or she passes on one of the two genes to the child. Therefore, there is a 50 percent chance that his or her child will inherit the faulty gene. If the child inherits the faulty gene, he or she will have the same type of OI as the parent. However, the child may be affected in different ways than the parent (e.g., the child's number of fractures, level of mobility, stature, etc. may not be identical to his or her parent's).  If the parent with OI passes on his or her normal gene to a child, that child will not have OI and cannot pass on the disorder to his or her own children.  A New Dominant Mutation   About 25 percent of children with OI are born into a family with no history of the disorder. That is, a child is born with a dominant genetic mutation that causes OI, yet neither parent has OI. This occurs when the child has a "new" or "spontaneous" dominant mutation. The gene spontaneously mutated in either the sperm or the egg before the child's conception. Now that the child has a dominant gene for OI, he or she has a 50 percent chance of passing the disorder on to his or her children, as explained above.  As far as we know, nothing the parents did caused a spontaneous mutation to occur. There are no known environmental, dietary, or behavioral triggers for this type of mutation.  In most cases, when a family with no history of OI has a child with OI, they are not at any greater risk than the general population for having a second child with OI. (For the exception to this rule, see "Mosaicism" below.) In addition, unaffected siblings of a person with OI are at no greater risk of having children with OI than the general population.  Mosaicism   In studies of families into which infants with OI Type II (the perinatal lethal form) were born, it was found that most of the babies had a new dominant mutation in a collagen gene. However, in some of these families, more than one infant was born with OI. Previously, researchers had seen this recurrence as evidence of recessive inheritance of this form of OI. More recently, however, researchers have concluded that the rare recurrence of OI in a previously unaffected family is more likely due to a phenomenon called mosaicism. Studies suggested that the mutation, instead of occurring in an individual sperm or egg, occurred in a percentage of the cells that give rise to a parent's multiple sperm or eggs . Thus, although the parent is not affected by the disorder, the mutation present in a percentage of his or her reproductive cells can result in more than one affected child. It is estimated that 2 to 4 percent of families into which an infant with OI Type II is born are at risk of having another affected child because of this problem with sperm or eggs. When Both Parents Have OI If two people with OI have a child, there is a 75 percent chance that the child will inherit one or both OI genes, as follows: There is a 25 percent chance the child will inherit only the mother's OI gene (and the father's unaffected gene), a 25 percent chance the child will inherit only the father's OI gene (and the mother's unaffected gene), and a 25 percent chance the child will inherit both parents' OI genes. Because this situation has been uncommon, the outcome of a child inheriting two OI genes is hard to predict. It is likely (even if both parents have mild OI) that the child would have a severe, possibly lethal, form of the disorder. Prenatal Diagnosis Testing is available to help families further understand what type of OI someone has, provide some insight into the natural history of the condition (i.e., what the family can expect), and assist in prenatal diagnosis for families who wish to exercise that option. One of these tests examines collagen proteins to look for the quantitative or qualitative collagen defects that lead to OI. A second test is done directly on DNA obtained from a blood sample, and looks for a genetic mutation that causes OI. Because of the relatively small 2 to 4 percent risk of recurrence of Type II OI in a family, many genetic centers now recommend very early ultrasound studies to determine if a developing fetus has the disorder. Women with OI who become pregnant, or women who conceive a child with a man who has OI, may also want to explore prenatal diagnosis. Undergoing prenatal diagnosis does not obligate parents to elect pregnancy termination, and the information obtained may be useful in managing pregnancy and delivery.  Ultrasound  is the least invasive procedure for prenatal diagnosis, and therefore carries the least risk. Using ultrasound, a doctor can examine the fetus' skeleton for bowing (bending of the leg or arm bones), fractures, shortening, or other bone abnormalities that may indicate OI. Type II OI is usually identifiable by 14 to 16 weeks gestation, and Type III by 16 to 18 weeks gestation. Though ultrasound has been used occasionally to diagnose milder forms of OI, mild OI is often not detected until late in the pregnancy, if at all. There are different levels of ultrasound, some of which are more useful than others for detecting OI in a fetus. Even when ultrasound is performed by a highly qualified ultrasonographer, it may be difficult to accurately pinpoint the type of OI before birth.  Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) examines placental cells, and, under some circumstances, can be used to detect abnormal collagen proteins or a genetic mutation that indicates that the fetus has OI. CVS can be performed at 10 to 14 weeks gestation. There is a 1 percent risk of miscarriage associated with CVS.  Amniocentesis examines fetal cells shed into the amniotic fluid. Because these cells carry all the genes that a fetus has inherited, amniocentesis can be used to look for a genetic mutation that causes OI. This technique is most useful when the mutation causing OI in a particular family has been identified through previous genetic testing of affected family members, including previous pregnancies involving a baby with OI. Amniocentesis is performed at 15 to 18 weeks gestation, and there is a 1 in 200 risk of miscarriage associated with the procedure. Various circumstances affect the usefulness and accuracy of these tests. Not all types of tests are available in all geographic areas. When CVS or amniocentesis are used to attempt prenatal diagnosis of a fetus who has a parent with OI, it is helpful for the affected parent to have the results of his or her own collagen or DNA test available. Families are encouraged to discuss these techniques with their physician, as well as a geneticist and/or genetic counselor, to learn more about which techniques are appropriate for their situation.

Description        Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The term " osteogenesis imperfecta " means imperfect bone formation. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth.  Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes.  Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta . The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma.  Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma.  Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta .  The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.            Enlarge          Frequency        This condition affects an estimated 6 to 7 per 100,000 people worldwide.  Types I and IV are the most common forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , affecting 4 to 5 per 100,000 people.      Related Information    What information about a genetic condition can statistics provide? Why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethnic groups?          Genetic Changes        Mutations in the COL1A1 , COL1A2 , CRTAP , and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type I collagen.  This type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body. Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily.  The mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  These mutations typically alter the structure of type I collagen molecules.  A defect in the structure of type I collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the CRTAP and P3H1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  Cases caused by CRTAP mutations are usually classified as type VII; when P3H1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type VIII.  The proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. Mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. These defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth. In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. These cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types V and VI.  Researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.

How can gene mutations affect health and development? More about Mutations and Health          Inheritance Pattern        Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta  inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered.  The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene.  Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .  When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

[1] It results in bones that break easily. [1] The severity may be mild to severe. [1] Other symptoms may include a blue tinge to the whites of the eye , short height, loose joints , hearing loss , breathing problems and problems with the teeth. [1] [3] Complications may include cervical artery dissection and aortic dissection . [5] [6] [7]  The underlying mechanism is usually a problem with connective tissue due to a lack of type I collagen . [1] This occurs in more than 90% of cases due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. [1] These genetic problems are often inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner or occur via a new mutation. [1] There are eight types, with type I being the least severe and type II the most severe. [1] Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and may be confirmed by collagen or DNA testing . [3]  There is no cure. [3] Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures. [4] Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy , braces or wheelchairs and surgery. [4] A type of surgery that puts metal rods through long bones may be done to strengthen them. [4] Tentative evidence supports the use of medications of the bisphosphonate type. [8] [9]  OI affects about one in 15,000 people. [1] Outcomes depend on the type of disease. [3] Most people, however, have good outcomes. [3] The condition has been described since ancient history. [10] The term "osteogenesis imperfecta" came into use in 1895 and means imperfect bone formation.

Bones fracture easily  Slight spinal curvature  Loose joints  Poor muscle tone  Discoloration of the sclera (whites of the eyes), usually giving them a blue-gray color. The blue-gray color of the sclera is due to the underlying choroidal veins which show through. This is due to the sclera being thinner than normal because the defective Type I collagen is not forming correctly.  Early loss of hearing in some children [13]  Slight protrusion of the eyes   IA and IB are defined to be distinguished by the absence/presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (characterized by opalescent teeth; absent in IA, present in IB). Life expectancy is slightly reduced compared to the general population due to the possibility of fatal bone fractures and complications related to OI Type I such as basilar invagination . [ citation needed ]  Type II [ edit ]  Collagen is not of a sufficient quality or quantity.   Most cases die within the first year of life due to respiratory failure or intracerebral hemorrhage  Severe respiratory problems due to underdeveloped lungs  Severe bone deformity and small stature   Type II can be further subclassified into groups A, B, and C, which are distinguished by radiographic evaluation of the long bones and ribs. Type IIA demonstrates broad and short long bones with broad and beaded ribs. Type IIB demonstrates broad and short long bones with thin ribs that have little or no beading. Type IIC demonstrates thin and longer long bones with thin and beaded ribs.  Type III [ edit ]  Collagen improperly formed, enough collagen is made but it is defective.   Bones fracture easily, sometimes even before birth  Bone deformity, often severe  Respiratory problems possible  Short stature, spinal curvature and sometimes barrel-shaped rib cage  Triangular face [14]  Loose joints (double-jointed)  Poor muscle tone in arms and legs  Discolouration of the sclera (the 'whites' of the eyes are blue)  Early loss of hearing possible   Type III is distinguished among the other classifications as being the "progressive deforming" type, wherein a neonate presents with mild symptoms at birth and develops the aforementioned symptoms throughout life. Lifespans may be normal, albeit with severe physical handicapping.  Type IV [ edit ]  Collagen quantity is sufficient but is not of a high enough quality   Bones fracture easily, especially before puberty  Short stature, spinal curvature, and barrel-shaped rib cage  Bone deformity is mild to moderate  Early loss of hearing   Similar to Type I, Type IV can be further subclassified into types IVA and IVB characterized by absence (IVA) or presence (IVB) of dentinogenesis imperfecta .  Type V [ edit ]     OI Type V in an adult       OI Type V in a child    Having the same clinical features as Type IV, it is distinguished histologically by "mesh-like" bone appearance. Further characterized by the "V triad" consisting of a) radio-opaque band adjacent to growth plates, b) hypertrophic calluses at fracture sites, and c) calcification of the radio - ulnar  interosseous membrane . [15]  OI Type V leads to calcification of the membrane between the two forearm bones, making it difficult to turn the wrist. Another symptom is abnormally large amounts of repair tissue ( hyperplasic callus) at the site of fractures. Other features of this condition include radial head dislocation, long bone bowing, and mixed hearing loss.  At least some cases of this type are caused by mutations in the IFITM5 gene. [12]  Type VI [ edit ]  With the same clinical features as Type IV, it is distinguished histologically by "fish-scale" bone appearance. Type VI has recently been found to be caused by a loss of function mutation in the SERPINF1 gene. SERPINF1 , a member of the serpin family, is also known as pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), the most powerful endogenous antiangiogenic factor in mammals.  Type VII [ edit ]  In 2006, a recessive form called "Type VII" was discovered (phenotype severe to lethal). Thus far it seems to be limited to a First Nations people in Quebec . [16] Mutations in the gene CRTAP causes this type. [17]  Type VIII [ edit ]  OI caused by mutation in the gene LEPRE1 is classified as type VIII. [17]  Other genes [ edit ]  A family with recessive osteogenesis imperfecta has been reported to have a mutation in the TMEM38B gene on chromosome 9 . [18] This gene encodes TRIC-B, a component of TRIC, a monovalent cation -specific channel involved in calcium release from intracellular stores.  It is extremely likely that there are other genes associated with this disease that have yet to be reported.  Pathophysiology [ edit ]  People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen . [19] This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen  triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. [20] As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. [21] Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. [20] These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.  As a genetic disorder, OI has historically been viewed as an autosomal dominant disorder of type I collagen. Most cases have been caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. In the past several years, there has been the identification of autosomal recessive forms. [22] Most people with OI receive it from a parent but in 35% of cases it is an individual ( de novo or "sporadic") mutation. [ citation needed ]  Diagnosis [ edit ]  Diagnosis is typically based on medical imaging, including plain Xrays, and symptoms. Signs on medical imaging include abnormalities in all extremeties and the spine. [23] An OI diagnosis can be confirmed through DNA or collagen testing, but in many cases the occurrence of bone fractures with little trauma and the presence of other clinical features such as blue sclera are sufficient for a diagnosis. A skin biopsy can be performed to determine the structure and quantity of type I collagen. DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis, however, it cannot exclude it because not all mutations causing OI are known and/or tested for. OI type II is often diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy, where already multiple fractures and other characteristic features may be present. Relative to control, OI cortical bone shows increased porosity, canal diameter, and connectivity in micro-computed tomography. [24]  An important differential diagnosis of OI is child abuse , as both may present with multiple fractures in various stages of healing. Differentiating them can be difficult, especially when no other characteristic features of OI are present. Other differential diagnoses include rickets , osteomalacia , and other rare skeletal syndromes.  Treatment [ edit ]  There is no cure. [3] Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures. Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy , braces or wheelchairs, and surgery. A type of surgery that puts metal rods through long bones may be done to strengthen them. [4]  Bone infections are treated as and when they occur with the appropriate antibiotics and antiseptics .  Bisphosphonates [ edit ]  In 1998, a clinical trial demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous pamidronate , a bisphosphonate which had previously been used in adults to treat osteoporosis. In severe OI, pamidronate reduced bone pain, prevented new vertebral fractures, reshaped previously fractured vertebral bodies, and reduced the number of long-bone fractures. [25]  Although oral bisphosphonates are more convenient and cheaper, they are not absorbed as well, and intravenous bisphosphonates are generally more effective, although this is under study. Some studies have found oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as oral alendronate and intravenous pamidronate, equivalent. [26] In a trial of children with mild OI, oral risedronate increased bone mineral densities, and reduced nonvertebral fractures. However, it did not decrease new vertebral fractures. [27] [28] A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that though bisphosphonates seem to improve bone mineral density, it is uncertain whether this leads to a reduction in fractures or an improvement in the quality of life of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. [9]  Bisphosphonates are less effective for OI in adults. [29]  Surgery [ edit ]  Metal rods can be surgically inserted in the long bones to improve strength, a procedure developed by Harold A. Sofield, MD, at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Chicago . During the late 1940s, Sofield, Chief of Staff at Shriners Hospitals in Chicago, worked there with large numbers of children with OI and experimented with various methods to strengthen the bones in these children. [30] In 1959, with Edward A. Miller, MD, Sofield wrote a seminal article describing a solution that seemed radical at the time: the placement of stainless steel rods into the intramedullary canals of the long bones to stabilize and strengthen them. His treatment proved extremely useful in the rehabilitation and prevention of fractures; it was adopted throughout the world and still forms the basis for orthopedic treatment of OI.  Spinal fusion can be performed to correct scoliosis , although the inherent bone fragility makes this operation more complex in OI patients. Surgery for basilar impressions can be carried out if pressure being exerted on the spinal cord and brain stem is causing neurological problems.  Physiotherapy [ edit ]  Physiotherapy is used to strengthen muscles and improve motility in a gentle manner, while minimizing the risk of fracture. This often involves hydrotherapy and the use of support cushions to improve posture. Individuals are encouraged to change positions regularly throughout the day to balance the muscles being used and the bones under pressure.  Children often develop a fear of trying new ways of moving due to movement being associated with pain. This can make physiotherapy difficult to administer to young children.  Physical aids [ edit ]  With adaptive equipment such as crutches , wheelchairs, splints, grabbing arms, or modifications to the home, many individuals with OI can maintain a significant degree of autonomy.  Teeth [ edit ]  More than 1 in 2 people with OI also have dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) - a congenital disorder of formation of dentine . [31] Dental treatment may pose as a challenge as a result of the various deformities, skeletal and dental, due to OI. Children with OI should go for a dental check-up as soon as their teeth erupt, this may minimize tooth structure loss as a result of abnormal dentine, and they should be monitored regularly to preserve their teeth and oral health. [31]  Many people with OI are treated with bisphosphonates, and there are several complications with dental procedures when a person is taking BP, namely bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ).  History [ edit ]  The condition, or types of it, has had various other names over the years and in different nations. Among some of the most common alternatives are Ekman-Lobstein syndrome, Vrolik syndrome, and the colloquial glass-bone disease. The name osteogenesis imperfecta dates to at least 1895 [32] and has been the usual medical term in the 20th century to present. The current four type system began with Sillence in 1979. [33] An older system deemed less severe types "osteogenesis imperfecta tarda" while more severe forms were deemed "osteogenesis imperfecta congenita." [34] As this terminology did not differentiate well between the types, and all forms of osteogenesis are congenital, this naming convention has since fallen out of favour.  The condition has been found in an ancient Egyptian  mummy from 1000 BC. The Norse  king  Ivar the Boneless may have had this condition, as well. The earliest studies of it began in 1788 with the Swede Olof Jakob Ekman. He described the condition in his doctoral thesis and mentioned cases of it going back to 1678. In 1831, Edmund Axmann described it in himself and two brothers. Jean Lobstein dealt with it in adults in 1833. Willem Vrolik did work on the condition in the 1850s. The idea that the adult and newborn forms were the same came in 1897 with Martin Benno Schmidt . [35]  Epidemiology [ edit ]  In the United States, the incidence of osteogenesis imperfecta is estimated to be one per 20,000 live births. [36] An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people are affected by OI in the United States.  Frequency is approximately the same across groups, but for unknown reasons, the Shona and Ndebele of Zimbabwe seem to have a higher proportion of Type III to Type I than other groups. [37] A similar pattern was found in segments of the Nigerian and South African populations. [ citation needed ] In these varied cases, the total number of OIs of all four types was roughly the same as any other ethnicity.  Society and culture [ edit ]  See also: List of people with osteogenesis imperfecta  The Brittle Bone Society is a UK charity that supports people with the condition.  Figures in film, television, video games and novels depicted as having osteogenesis imperfecta include:   Robby Novak (also known as Kid President), a motivational speaker and YouTube personality as of 2013. [38] He often comments on his own ability to overcome the disorder. [39]  Samuel L. Jackson 's fictional character Elijah Price in M. Night Shyamalan 's 2000 film Unbreakable and its 2019 follow-up Glass , who was born with type I osteogenesis imperfecta. [40]  Asa Butterfield 's fictional character Gardner Elliot in Peter Chelsom 's 2017 film The Space Between Us was born with osteogenesis imperfecta due to being born on the planet Mars . [41]  Jeff "Joker" Moreau, a fictional character from the Mass Effect video game series voiced by Seth Green . Given that the series is set in the fictional future, he is able to take medications to help with his disease and is a pilot. The medication, along with a mix of Cerberus implants and braces, allow him to walk and dance, although not as fluidly as others without the disease. [42]   Other animals [ edit ]  In dogs, OI is an autosomal-recessive condition. In Golden Retrievers, it is caused by a mutation in the COL1A1 , and in Beagles, the COL1A2 . A separate mutation in the SERPINH1 gene has been found to cause the condition in Dachshunds. [43] Several mouse models of OI have been described, whereby the abnormal gait 2 (AGA2) mouse line exhibits severe skeletal [44] and cardio-pulmonary [45] phenotypes due to a carboxy-terminus mutation in the COL1A1 gene in the mouse.

The specific symptoms and physical findings associated with OI vary greatly from case to case. The severity of OI also varies greatly, even among individuals of the same family. OI may be a mild disorder or may result in severe complications. Four main types of OI have been identified. OI type I is the most common and the mildest form of the disorder. OI type II is the most severe. In most cases, the various forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are inherited as autosomal dominant traits.     Signs & Symptoms  In all types of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, the associated symptoms vary greatly from case to case, even within families. Some affected individuals may not experience any bone fractures or only a few; other affected individuals may experience multiple fractures. OI may range from a mild disorder with few symptoms to a severe, debilitating disorder. The age of onset of fractures also varies from case to case.  Osteogenesis Type I  Osteogenesis type I is the most common and usually the mildest form of OI. In most cases, it is characterized by multiple bone fractures usually occurring during childhood through puberty. Fractures usually begin when an affected child begins to walk; fractures during the newborn (neonatal) period are rare. The frequency of fractures usually declines after puberty. Repeated fractures may result in slight malformation of the bones of the arms and legs (e.g., bowing of the tibia and femur).  A distinguishing feature associated with OI type I is bluish discoloration of the whites of the eyes (blue sclera). In some cases, individuals with OI type I may develop abnormalities affecting the middle and/or inner ears contributing to, or resulting in, hearing impairment (i.e., conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss). Hearing loss occurs most often in the third decade of life; however, it can occur as early as the second decade or as late as the seventh.  Individuals with OI type I may have a triangular facial appearance and an abnormally large head (macrocephaly).  In approximately 50 percent of cases, individuals with OI type I will experience growth deficiencies after birth (postnatal), resulting in mild short stature (e.g., affected individuals will be shorter than unaffected family members). Approximately 20 percent of adults with OI type I develop abnormal sideways or front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis).  Additional symptoms associated with OI type I include loose (hyperextensible) joints, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and thin skin that bruises easily.  Some researchers believe that a subgroup of OI type I exists in which affected individuals experience dental abnormalities in addition to the abovementioned features.  Osteogenesis Type II  OI type II is the most severe type of osteogenesis imperfecta. Affected infants often experience life-threatening complications at, or shortly after, birth. Infants with OI type II have low birth weight, abnormally short arms and legs (limbs), and bluish discoloration of the whites of the eyes (blue sclera). In addition, affected infants may have extremely fragile bones and numerous fractures present at birth. The ribs and long bones of the legs of affected infants are often malformed.  Infants with OI type II often have underdeveloped lungs and an abnormally small upper chest (thorax) that may result in life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. In some cases, affected infants may experience congestive heart failure.  Infants with OI type II may also have a small, narrow nose; a small jaw (micrognathia); and an abnormally soft top of the skull (calvaria) with abnormally large soft spots (large fonatanelle). Affected infants may also have abnormally thin, fragile skin and low muscle tone (hypotonia).  OI type II has been subdivided into three subgroups (A, B, and C) based upon small differences in bone formation seen only on x-rays (radiographic features).  Osteogenesis Type III  OI type III is characterized by extremely fragile bones, multiple fractures, and malformed bones. Multiple fractures are often present at birth. Fractures and malformation of various bones (most often the ribs and long bones) may become worse (progressive malformation) as affected infants and children age.  Progressive malformation of various bones may result in short stature, sideways and front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis), and malformation of the area where the bone in the back of the skull (occipital bone) and the top of the spine meet (basilar impression). In some cases, affected individuals may develop pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory problems. In severe cases, progressive bone malformation may result in affected individuals requiring wheelchairs.  Infants with OI type III may have a slight blue discoloration to the whites of the eyes (blue sclera) at birth. In most cases, the bluish tinge fades during the first year of life. Affected infants may have a triangular facial appearance due to an abnormally prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia). In some cases, hearing impairment and brittle, discolored teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta) may also be present.  Osteogenesis Type IV  Individuals with OI type IV have fragile bones that often fracture easily. Fractures are more common before puberty. Affected individuals experience mild to moderate bone malformation and are usually shorter than average. Affected individuals may develop sideways and front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis).  Individuals with OI type IV may have a triangular facial appearance. In most cases, the whites of the eyes (sclera) are normal or pale blue during infancy. As an affected infant ages, the pale blue discoloration of the sclera fades. Affected individuals may also experience hearing impairment and brittle, discolored teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta)  Unclassified Osteogenesis Imperfecta  Many cases of individuals with the bone abnormalities characteristic of osteogenesis imperfecta have been reported in the medical literature. However, these cases have additional symptoms that prevent them from being classified under one of the four main types of OI. Researchers have speculated that these cases may be subgroups of one of the four main types of OI, an additional type of OI (e.g., OI type V), or separate disorders. (For more information on these disorders, see the Related Disorders section below.)      Causes  In most cases, osteogenesis imperfecta types I, II, and IV are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Most cases of OI type II occur without a previous family history of the disorder, resulting instead from a spontaneous genetic change (i.e., new mutation). The inheritance of this mutation is autosomal dominant.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed “dominating” the other normal gene and resulting in the appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.  The risk is the same for each pregnancy.  Rare subgroups of OI types II and III may be inherited as autosomal recessive genetic traits. In recessive disorders, the condition does not occur unless an individual inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy.  Investigators have determined that most types of osteogenesis imperfecta are caused by disruption or changes (mutations) of one of two genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2). These genes carry instructions for the production of type 1 collagen. Collagen is the major protein of bone and connective tissue including the skin, tendons, and sclera.  The COL1A1 gene is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 17 (17q21.31-q22). Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of all body cells. They carry the genetic characteristics of each individual. Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22, with an unequal 23rd pair of X and Y chromosomes for males and two X chromosomes for females. Each chromosome has a short arm designated as “p” and a long arm identified by the letter “q.” Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered. For example, “chromosome 17q21.31-q22” refers to bands 21.31-22 on the long arm of chromosome 17.  The COL1A2 gene is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 7 (7q22.1).  In 2006, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) discovered that a previously unexplained fatal form of osteogenesis imperfecta results from a genetic defect in a different gene known as CRTAP.  The CRTAP gene codes for (contains the information for) cartilage-associated protein.  These mutations are associated with a recessive form of the disorder.  The discovery of this gene was described in an article published in the December 28, 2006, New England Journal of Medicine.      Affected Populations  Osteogenesis imperfecta affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of individuals with OI in the United States (prevalence) is unknown. OI type I is estimated to occur in one in 30,000 live births. OI type II is estimated to occur in one in 60,000 live births. The overall prevalence of all types of OI is estimated at .5 per 10,000 individuals in the United States. Approximately 20,000 to 50,000 individuals in the United States have OI.      Related Disorders  Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of osteogenesis imperfecta.  Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis:  Achondroplasia is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short arms and legs and short stature (short-limbed dwarfism), abnormal facial features, and/or skeletal malformations. Characteristic facial features may include an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), unusual prominence of the forehead (frontal bossing), a low nasal bridge, and/or underdevelopment of the middle portion of the face (midface hypoplasia). Skeletal malformations may include unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), abnormally increased backward curvature of the spine (lordosis), legs that bow outward (genu varum), and/or narrowing (stenosis) of the spine. Additional abnormalities may include limited extension of the elbows and hips, diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), and/or frequent infections of the middle ear (otitis media). In most cases, achondroplasia appears to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadic). (For more information on this disorder, choose “Achondroplasia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Hypophosphatasia is a rare disorder characterized by defective bone hardening (mineralization) resulting in weakened bones. The long bones of the arms and legs may be abnormally thick, short and bowed. Affected infants may also have an abnormally small head (microcepahly). Many adults with hypophosphatasia have short stature. Hypophosphatasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Hypophosphatasia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Pyknodysostosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased density of bones (osteosclerosis), short stature, an underdeveloped lower jaw (mandible), and dental abnormalities. Affected individuals often have fragile bones and may be prone to stress fractures. Pyknodysostosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Pyknodysostosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Osteopetrosis is a rare disorder marked by increased bone density, brittle bones, and, in some cases, skeletal abnormalities. Although symptoms may not initially be apparent in people with mild forms of this disorder, trivial injuries may cause bone fractures, due to abnormalities of the bone. The adult type of osteopetrosis is milder than the malignant infantile and intermediate types of osteopetrosis, and may not be diagnosed until adolescence or adulthood when symptoms first appear. More serious complications occur in the malignant infantile and intermediate types of osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis may be inherited as an autosomal recessive or dominant trait. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Osteopetrosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Osteogenesis imperfecta syndromes is the term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by bone abnormalities (e.g., fragile bones and multiple fractures) similar to those found in the main four types of OI. However, these disorders have associated features that differentiate them from the main four types of OI. These so-called osteogenesis imperfecta syndromes are extremely rare with only a few cases for each syndrome described in the medical literature. Cole-Carpenter syndrome described below is an osteogenesis imperfecta syndrome.  Cole-Carpenter syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by extremely fragile bones and multiple fractures like those seen in OI. In addition, affected infants may experience bluish discoloration of the whites of the eyes (blue sclera), premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), an abnormally prominent forehead (frontal bossing), an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), and abnormal protrusion of the eye (proptosis). Affected infants may also experience growth failure. Approximately five cases of this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. Cole-Carpenter syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.      Diagnosis  A diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of specialized tests. Surgical removal and microscopic examination (biopsy) of the skin may be done to determine whether abnormalities of collagen are present. A blood sample may be taken and tested to detect the presence of the genetic mutation that causes OI.  In some cases, the diagnosis of OI may be made before birth (prenatally), based upon specialized tests such as ultrasound, amniocentesis, and/or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Ultrasound studies may reveal characteristic findings such as fractures or bowing of the long bones. During amniocentesis, a sample of fluid that surrounds the developing fetus is removed and studied. During chorionic villus sampling, a tissue sample is removed from a portion of the placenta. Chromosomal studies performed on this fluid or tissue sample may reveal the genetic mutation that causes OI.      Standard Therapies  Treatment  The treatment of OI is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms, maintaining individual mobility, and strengthening bone and muscle.  Exercise and physical therapy programs have proven beneficial in strengthening muscles, increasing weight-bearing capacity, and reducing the tendency to fracture. Physical therapy in the water (hydrotherapy) has also been proven helpful since moving around in water lessens the chance of fracture. Individuals with OI should consult with their physicians and physical therapists to determine a safe and appropriate exercise program.  A procedure in which metal rods are surgically placed in the long bones to prevent fractures (rodding) is often used to treat individuals with OI. Plastic braces are replacing plaster casts as protective devices because they permit greater freedom of movement and can be used in water. Inflatable suits can provide added protection, especially to very young children.  Surgery may prove necessary for individuals with severe malformation of the bones of the spine or basilar impression. Dental procedures may be necessary to correct various dental abnormalities. Affected individuals, especially adults, should be monitored for hearing impairment often associated with OI. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for affected individuals and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.      Investigational Therapies  Information on current clinical trials is posted on the Internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

As of January 2007, there were seven clinical trials listed on www.clinicaltrials.gov investigating various treatment strategies for osteogenesis imperfecta.  Among them, researchers were studying new treatment options for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, including bisphosphonate drugs, growth hormones, and bone marrow transplants.  One of these drugs is Fosomax, which earned an FDA orphan drug designation in 2004.  Another drug study is a phase IV trial involving the drug Teriparatide for the treatment of adults with this disorder.  Growth hormone (GH) therapy has proven beneficial in individuals with mild or moderate forms of OI. GH has helped improve collagen production and increased growth and bone mineral density. More research is necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of this treatment for individuals with OI.  Initial studies of the bisphosphonate drug, Pamidronate, have shown an increase in bone mineral density and a reduction in the frequency of fractures in individuals with severe forms of OI. More research is necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of OI.  Marrow mesenchymal cell therapy is currently (2006) being investigated in a clinical study that began in 2004. This involves a bone marrow transplant procedure.

What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  NHGRI Research on Osteogenesis imperfecta  Additional Resources on Osteogenesis imperfecta   What is Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes a person's bones to break easily, often from little or no apparent trauma. OI is also called "brittle bone disease." OI varies in severity from person to person, ranging from a mild type to a severe type that causes death before or shortly after birth. In addition to having fractures, people with OI also have teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), and hearing loss when they are adults. People who have OI may also have muscle weakness, loose joints (joint laxity) and skeletal malformations.  OI occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals, including people diagnosed after birth. OI occurs with equal frequency among males and females and among racial and ethnic groups. Life expectancy varies depending on how severe the OI is, ranging from very brief (lethal form, OI type II) to average.  There are four well-known types of OI. These types are distinguished mostly by fracture frequency and severity and by characteristic features. Three additional types of OI (type V, VI and VII) have also been identified.  The vast majority (90 percent) of OI is caused by a single dominant mutation in one of two type I collagen genes: COL1A1 or COL1A2 .The COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to create a larger molecule called type I collagen. This type of collagen is the most common protein in bone, skin and other tissues that provide structure and strength to the body (connective tissues). OI type VII is caused by recessive mutations in the CRTAP gene.  Top of page  What are the symptoms of Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) causes bones to be fragile and easily broken and is also responsible for other health problems.  Type I OI is the mildest form of the condition. People who have type I OI have bone fractures during childhood and adolescence often due to minor trauma When these individuals reach adulthood they have fewer fractures.  Type II OI is the most severe form of OI. Infants with type II have bones that appear bent or crumpled and fractured before birth. Their chest is narrow and they have fractured and misshapen ribs and underdeveloped lungs. These infants have short, bowed arms and legs; hips that turn outward; and unusually soft skull bones. Most infants with type II OI are stillborn or die shortly after birth, usually from breathing failure.  Type III OI also has relatively severe signs and symptoms. Infants with OI type III have very soft and fragile bones that may begin to fracture before birth or in early infancy. Some infants have rib fractures that can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. Bone abnormalities tend to get worse over time and often interfere with the ability to walk.  Type IV OI is the most variable form OI. Symptoms of OI type IV can range from mild to severe. About 25 percent of infants with OI type IV are born with bone fractures. Others may not have broken bones until later in childhood or adulthood. Infants with OI type IV have leg bones that are bowed at birth, but bowing usually lessens as they get older.  Some types of OI are also associated with progressive hearing loss, a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and loose joints. People with this condition may have other bone abnormalities and are often shorter in stature than average.  Top of page  How is Osteogenesis imperfecta diagnosed?  OI is often inherited from an affected parent. The diagnosis of OI is made on the basis of family history and/or clinical presentation. Frequent fractures, short stature, a blue hue to the white part of the eye (blue sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta) and hearing loss that progresses after puberty may be present.  X-rays are also used to diagnose OI. X-ray findings include fractures that are at different stages of healing; an unexpected skull bone pattern called Wormian bones; and bones in the spine called "codfish vertebrae."  Laboratory testing for OI may include either biochemical testing or DNA-based sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 . Biochemical testing involves studying collagens taken from a small skin biopsy. Changes in type I collagen are an indication of OI.  DNA sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 is used to identify the type I collagen gene mutation responsible for the altered collagen protein. DNA testing requires a blood sample for DNA extraction. Both tests are relatively sensitive, detecting approximately 90 percent and 95 percent, respectively, of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of OI. Normal biochemical and molecular testing in a child with OI warrants additional testing of less common collagen genes ( CRTAP and P3H (LEPRE1) ) responsible for some of the rare recessive forms of OI.  Top of page  What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  There is currently no cure for OI. Treatment involves supportive therapy to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities, help with independent living and maintain overall health. OI is best managed by a medical team including the child's own doctor, and genetic, orthopedic and rehabilitation medicine. Supportive therapy is unique to each individual depending on the severity of their condition and their age.  Physical and occupational therapies to help improve their ability to move, to prevent fractures and to increase muscle strength are often useful.  Fractures are treated as they would be in children and adults who do not have OI. An orthopedic treatment called intramedullary rodding (placing rods in the bones) is used to help with positioning of legs that helps with more normal functioning when necessary.  A newer treatment with medication called biophosphonates is being used to help with bone formation and to decrease the need for surgery.  Top of page  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  Most types of OI are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Almost all infants with the severe type II OI are born into families without a family history of the condition. Usually, the cause in these families is a new mutation in the egg or sperm or very early embryo in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. In the milder forms of OI, 25-30 percent of cases occur as a result of new mutations. The other cases are inherited from a parent who has the condition. Whether a person has OI due to a new mutation or an inherited genetic change, an adult with the disorder can pass the condition down to future generations.  In autosomal dominant inherited OI, a parent who has OI has one copy of a gene mutation that causes OI. With each of his/her pregnancies, there is a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the OI gene mutation to a child who would have OI, and a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the normal version of the gene to a child who would not have OI.  Rarely, OI can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. The autosomal recessive form of type III OI usually results from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .

Fall 2006.  Can people who have OI have children? Yes. Many men and women who have OI are parents. All young people who have OI need to receive information about reproductive health, sexuality and the genetics of OI. There is some research that indicates that couples with any genetic disorder may have a lower success rate for becoming pregnant, but OI does not prevent having children. Many people with OI conceive children naturally. Sometimes their children have OI. (See “What are the odds of passing OI on to your children?” below.) Adults with OI who chose to become parents report that they don’t regret their choice, but acknowledge sometimes feeling grief or sadness when their child with OI is in pain.  Can women who have OI use birth control pills? In most cases, the answer is yes. Women of short stature should consult with their doctor about whether a low dose pill would be more appropriate for them and whether the birth control pill they wish to use is associated with bone density loss.  Should adults considering parenthood seek genetic counseling? Many couples seek genetic counseling before they become pregnant. This can be a good way to get answers to personal questions about OI and genetics. Knowing the parent’s OI mutation is helpful in planning for delivery and for determining if the child has OI. Certain methods of prenatal diagnosis of OI are only possible if the affected parent’s mutation is known. If the parent with OI has never had a collagen biopsy or DNA analysis to identify the mutation, it is important to start the process either early in the pregnancy or before conception, since it takes many months to get test results.   What are the odds of passing OI on to your children? When one parent has OI there is a 50% chance with each pregnancy that the child will have OI. If both parents have OI there is a 75% chance that the child will have OI. Usually the child will have the same OI-causing mutation as the parent, although the child’s symptoms can be milder or more severe than the parent’s symptoms. No one knows for sure how or why this happens. It is possible that the child of a person with OI will have a spontaneous genetic mutation resulting in a different type of OI, but the chances of this happening are about 1 in 15,000. When a parent has a moderate or severe form of OI and no collagen mutation can be identified, then a test for one of the recessive forms of OI is needed. If a person with OI has a recessive form of OI, then his or her siblings have a 50% chance of being carriers of the recessive gene. When both parents are carriers of a recessive OI mutation, there is a 25% chance that their child will have OI. Excluding OI, the risk of other congenital disorders in pregnancies in which one parent has OI is the same as that of the general population.  Is it possible to change the odds? At this time, there are no treatments, or dietary supplements that can prevent the fetus from having OI or that will make the type of OI milder. There are several options for couples to consider including using a sperm or egg donor, a surrogate mother for the pregnancy, or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Detailed information about each option can be obtained from your primary care doctor, your gynecologist, a genetic counselor or from fertility clinic staff. PGD is a bio-technology that makes it possible to avoid passing on OI. It involves the standard in vitro fertilization process plus the added step of “embryo analysis.” After a couple goes through the initial stages for in vitro fertilization and embryos have been formed, a single cell is removed from the dividing cells at the 8 cell stage. It is tested for OI. If the embryo does not show any signs of OI, it is implanted in the mother to continue normal development. At this time there are no known negative effects on the fetus from having one cell removed at the 8 cell stage. The OI gene cannot be removed, but the process allows only embryos without the mutation to be implanted. Only one genetic condition can be tested for and the possibility exists that the embryo carries some other mutation. The success rate for in vitro fertilization averages 17-40% depending on the number of embryos implanted, the age of the parents, and other medical factors. To be candidates for this process, the parent’s exact OI mutation must have been previously identified, usually through DNA analysis. Then a test for OI must be developed by the bio-engineers. Since OI is caused by many different mutations, a separate test must be developed for each family. The test in the PGD process looks for the exact same mutation in the gene sequence of the embryo cell. In general, the extra step of “embryo analysis” comes close to doubling the cost for in vitro fertilization. In some cases, insurance covers at least part of the cost of the PGD portion of the process and the in vitro fertilization parts of this process. It is important to determine what your insurance will cover at the beginning of the process. The PGD and in vitro fertilization process is physically rigorous for the woman, and can be stressful for both parents. It can require more than one treatment cycle.  Are there special concerns if the mother is the person with OI? All women with OI need expert medical care during pregnancy. Women who are considering a pregnancy should work with their doctor to ensure that they go into pregnancy in good health and that any OI-related health issues are addressed. Short stature, a history of pelvic or spine fracture, back pain and a history of respiratory problems are important areas for discussion. It takes women with OI longer to recover from the bone loss associated with any pregnancy. The obstetrician can also provide information about prenatal testing, such as ultrasound, and may order additional testing to help plan for delivery. Please see the OI Foundation fact sheet OI Issues: Pregnancy Considerations for Women with OI for a more detailed discussion.  What are the special considerations when the father has OI? When the father has OI, the obstetrician may suggest additional ultrasounds to see if the fetus shows any signs of having OI. For more information about prenatal testing and options for giving birth, please see the OI Foundation fact sheet OI Issues: Obstetric Considerations for Women without OI.  Do people who have OI qualify to be adoptive or foster parents? Yes. Many resources are available to help adults learn about adoption or becoming a foster parent. Some of these resources are listed below. The OI Foundation posts information about children with OI who are available for adoption on its web site www.oif.org under “Programs and Support.” For information about foster parenting, contact your local government’s department of social services or the organizations listed below.

A classification system of different types of OI is commonly used to help describe how severely a person with OI is affected. For example, a person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.  Prevalence While the number of people affected with OI in the United States is unknown, the best estimate suggests a minimum of 20,000 and possibly as many as 50,000.  Diagnosis OI is caused by genetic defects that affect the body’s ability to make strong bones. In dominant (classical) OI, a person has too little type I collagen or a poor quality of type I collagen due to a mutation in one of the type I collagen genes. Collagen is the major protein of the body’s connective tissue. It is part of the framework that bones are formed around. In recessive OI, mutations in other genes interfere with collagen production. The result in all cases is fragile bones that break easily.  It is often, though not always, possible to diagnose OI based solely on clinical features. Clinical geneticists can also perform biochemical (collagen) or molecular (DNA) tests that can help confirm a diagnosis of OI in some situations. These tests generally require several weeks before results are known. Both the collagen biopsy test and DNA test are thought to detect almost 90% of all type I collagen mutations.  A positive type I collagen study confirms the diagnosis of dominant OI, but a negative result could mean that either a collagen type I mutation is present but was not detected or the patient has a form of the disorder that is not associated with type 1 collagen mutations or the patient has a recessive form of OI. Therefore, a negative type I collagen study does not rule out OI. When a type I collagen mutation is not found, other DNA tests to check for recessive forms are available.  Clinical Features The characteristic features of OI vary greatly from person to person, even among people with the same type of OI, and even within the same family. Not all characteristics are evident in each case. The majority of cases of OI (possibly 85-90 %) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type I collagen (Types I, II, III, and IV in the following list). Types VII and VIII are newly identified forms that are inherited in a recessive manner. The genes causing these two types have been identified. Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen mutation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. The general features of each known type of OI are as follows:  Type I   Most common and mildest type of OI.  Bones fracture easily. Most fractures occur before puberty.  Normal or near-normal stature.  Loose joints and muscle weakness.  Sclera (whites of the eyes) usually have a blue, purple, or gray tint.  Triangular face.  Tendency toward spinal curvature.  Bone deformity absent or minimal.  Brittle teeth possible.  Hearing loss possible, often beginning in early 20s or 30s.  Collagen structure is normal, but the amount is less than normal.   Type II   Most severe form.  Frequently lethal at or shortly after birth, often due to respiratory problems.  Numerous fractures and severe bone deformity.  Small stature with underdeveloped lungs.  Tinted sclera.  Collagen improperly formed.   Type III   Bones fracture easily. Fractures often present at birth, and x-rays may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth.  Short stature.  Sclera have a blue, purple, or gray tint.  Loose joints and poor muscle development in arms and legs.  Barrel-shaped rib cage.  Triangular face.  Spinal curvature.  Respiratory problems possible.  Bone deformity, often severe.  Brittle teeth possible.  Hearing loss possible.  Collagen improperly formed.   Type IV   Between Type I and Type III in severity.  Bones fracture easily. Most fractures occur before puberty.  Shorter than average stature.  Sclera are white or near-white (i.e. normal in color).  Mild to moderate bone deformity.  Tendency toward spinal curvature.  Barrel-shaped rib cage.  Triangular face.  Brittle teeth possible.  Hearing loss possible.  Collagen improperly formed.   By studying the appearance of OI bone under the microscope, investigators noticed that some people who are clinically within the Type IV group had a distinct pattern to their bone. When they reviewed the full medical history of these people, they found that groups had other features in common. They named these groups Types V and VI OI. The mutations causing these forms of OI have not been identified, but people in these two groups do not have mutations in the type I collagen genes.  Type V   Clinically similar to Type IV in appearance and symptoms of OI.  A dense band seen on x-rays adjacent to the growth plate of the long bones.  Unusually large calluses (hypertrophic calluses) at the sites of fractures or surgical procedures. (A callus is an area of new bone that is laid down at the fracture site as part of the healing process.)  Calcification of the membrane between the radius and ulna (the bones of the forearm). This leads to restriction of forearm rotation.  White sclera.  Normal teeth.  Bone has a “mesh-like” appearance when viewed under the microscope.  Dominant inheritance pattern   Type VI   Clinically similar to Type IV in appearance and symptoms of OI.  The alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme linked to bone formation) activity level is slightly elevated in OI Type VI. This can be determined by a blood test.  Bone has a distinctive “fish-scale” appearance when viewed under the microscope.  Diagnosed by bone biopsy.  Whether this form is inherited in a dominant or recessive manner is unknown, but researchers believe the mode of inheritance is most likely recessive.  Eight people with this type of OI have been identified.   Recessive Forms of OI After years of research, two forms of OI that are inherited in a recessive manner were discovered in 2006. Both types are caused by genes that affect collagen formation. These forms provide information for people who have severe or moderately severe OI but who do not have a primary collagen mutation.  Type VII   The first described cases resemble Type IV OI in many aspects of appearance and symptoms.  In other instances the appearance and symptoms are similar to Type II lethal OI, except infants had white sclera, a small head and a round face.  Short stature.  Short humerus (arm bone) and short femur (upper leg bone)  Coxa vera is common (the acutely angled femur head affects the hip socket).  Results from recessive inheritance of a mutation to the CRTAP (cartilage-associated protein) gene. Partial function of CRTAP leads to moderate symptoms while total absence of CRTAP was lethal in all 4 identified cases.   Type VIII   Resembles lethal Type II or Type III OI in appearance and symptoms except that infants have white sclera.  Severe growth deficiency.  Extreme skeletal under mineralization.  Caused by a deficiency of P3H1 (Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1) due to a mutation to the LEPRE1 gene.   Inheritance Factors Most cases of OI (85-90%) are caused by a dominant genetic defect. This means that only one copy of the mutation carrying gene is necessary for the child to have OI. Children who have the dominant form of OI have either inherited it from a parent or, when the parent does not have OI, as a spontaneous mutation.  Approximately 10-15 percent of cases of OI are the result of a recessive mutation. In this situation, the parents do not have OI, but both carry the mutation in their genes. To inherit recessive OI the child must receive a copy of the mutation from both parents.  When a child has recessive OI, there is a 25 percent chance per pregnancy that the parents will have another child with OI. Siblings of a person with a recessive form of OI have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier of the recessive gene. DNA testing is available to help parents and siblings determine if they are carriers of this type of gene mutation.  A person with a form of OI caused by a dominant mutation has a 50 percent chance of passing on the disorder to each of his or her children. If one parent has OI because of a recessive mutation, 100 percent of their children will be carriers of the recessive OI mutation. Whether any of these children will have OI will depend on their inheritance from the other parent. Genetic counselors can help people with OI and their family members further understand OI genetics and the possibility of recurrence, and assist in prenatal diagnosis for those who wish to exercise that option. For more information on OI inheritance, see the OI Foundation fact sheet titled “Genetics.”  Treatment There is not yet a cure for OI. Treatment is directed toward preventing or controlling the symptoms, maximizing independent mobility, and developing optimal bone mass and muscle strength. Care of fractures, extensive surgical and dental procedures, and physical therapy are often recommended for people with OI. Use of wheelchairs, braces, and other mobility aids is common, particularly (although not exclusively) among people with more severe types of OI.  People with OI are encouraged to exercise as much as possible to promote muscle and bone strength, which can help prevent fractures. Swimming and water therapy are common exercise choices for people with OI, as water allows independent movement with little risk of fracture. For those who are able, walking (with or without mobility aids) is excellent exercise. People with OI should consult their physician and/or physical therapist to discuss appropriate and safe exercise.  Children and adults with OI will also benefit from maintaining a healthy weight, eating a nutritious diet, and avoiding activities such as smoking, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption, and taking steroid medications — all of which may deplete bone and make bones more fragile. For more information on nutrition, see the OI Foundation fact sheet titled “Nutrition.”  A surgical procedure called “rodding” is frequently considered for people with OI. This treatment involves inserting metal rods through the length of the long bones to strengthen them and prevent and/or correct deformities. For more information, see the OI Foundation’s fact sheet on “Rodding Surgery.”  Several medications and other treatments are being explored for their potential use to treat OI. These include growth hormone treatment, treatment with intravenous and oral drugs called bisphosphonates, an injected drug called teriparatide (for adults only) and gene therapies. It is not clear if people with recessive OI will respond in the same manner as people with dominant OI to these treatments. The OI Foundation provides current information on research studies, as well as information about participating in clinical trials.  Prognosis The prognosis for a person with OI varies greatly depending on the number and severity of symptoms. Respiratory failure is the most frequent cause of death for people with OI, followed by accidental trauma. Despite numerous fractures, restricted physical activity, and short stature, most adults and children with OI lead productive and successful lives. They attend school, develop friendships and other relationships, have careers, raise families, participate in sports and other recreational activities and are active members of their communities.

Description        Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The term " osteogenesis imperfecta " means imperfect bone formation. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth.  Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes.  Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta . The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma.  Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma.  Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta .  The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.            Enlarge          Frequency        This condition affects an estimated 6 to 7 per 100,000 people worldwide.  Types I and IV are the most common forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , affecting 4 to 5 per 100,000 people.      Related Information    What information about a genetic condition can statistics provide? Why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethnic groups?          Genetic Changes        Mutations in the COL1A1 , COL1A2 , CRTAP , and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type I collagen.  This type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body. Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily.  The mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  These mutations typically alter the structure of type I collagen molecules.  A defect in the structure of type I collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the CRTAP and P3H1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  Cases caused by CRTAP mutations are usually classified as type VII; when P3H1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type VIII.  The proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. Mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. These defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth. In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. These cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types V and VI.  Researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.

How can gene mutations affect health and development? More about Mutations and Health          Inheritance Pattern        Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta  inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered.  The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene.  Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .  When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.

[8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

A classification system of different types of OI is commonly used to help describe how severely a person with OI is affected. For example, a person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.  Prevalence  Diagnosis  Clinical Features  New Recessive Forms of OI  Inheritance Factors  Treatment  Prognosis  Resource  For Your Information  Prevalence  Although the number of people affected with OI in the United States is unknown, the best estimate suggests a minimum of 25,000 and possibly as many as 50,000.  Diagnosis  OI is caused by genetic defects that affect the body’s ability to make strong bones. Collagen is the major protein of the body’s connective tissue and can be likened to the framework around which a building is constructed. In dominant (classical) OI, a person has either too little type 1 collagen or a poor quality of type 1 collagen caused by a mutation in one of the type 1 collagen genes. In recessive OI, mutations in other genes interfere with collagen production. The result in all cases is weak bones that break easily.  It is often possible to diagnose OI based solely on clinical features. Clinical geneticists can perform biochemical (collagen) or molecular (DNA) tests that can help confirm a diagnosis of OI in some situations.  These tests generally require several weeks before results are known. Both the collagen biopsy test and the DNA test are thought to detect nearly 90 percent of all type 1 collagen mutations.  A positive collagen type I test confirms the diagnosis of dominant OI, but a negative result leaves open the possibility that:  A type 1 collagen mutation is present but was not detected.  The patient has a form of the disorder that is not associated with type 1 collagen mutations.  The patient has a recessive form of OI.  Therefore, a negative type 1 collagen study does not rule out OI. When a type 1 collagen mutation is not found, other DNA tests can check for recessive forms.  Clinical Features  The characteristic features of OI vary greatly from person to person, even among people with the same type of OI and even within the same family. Not all characteristics are evident in each case. The majority of OI cases (possibly 85 to 90 percent) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type 1 collagen (Types I, II, III, and IV in the following list). Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen mutation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. Types VII and VIII are newly discovered forms that are inherited in a recessive manner, and the genes causing these two types have been identified. The general features of each of the known types of OI, which vary in characteristics and severity, are as follows:  Type I OI  most common and mildest type of OI  bones predisposed to fracture (most fractures occur before puberty)  normal or near-normal stature  loose joints and muscle weakness  blue, purple, or gray tint to sclera (whites of the eyes)  triangular face  tendency toward spinal curvature  absent or minimal bone deformity  possible brittle teeth  possible hearing loss, often beginning in early twenties or thirties  normal collagen structure, but less than normal amount  Type II OI  most severe form of OI  frequently causes death at birth or shortly after, because of respiratory problems  numerous fractures and severe bone deformity  small stature with underdeveloped lungs  blue, purple, or gray tinted sclera  improperly formed collagen  Type III OI  most severe type among those who survive the neonatal period  easily fractured bones (Fractures often present at birth, and x-rays may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth.)  small stature  blue, purple, or gray tinted sclera  loose joints and poor muscle development in arms and legs  barrel-shaped rib cage  triangular face  spinal curvature  possible respiratory problems  often severe bone deformity  possible brittle teeth  possible hearing loss  improperly formed collagen  Type IV OI  between Type I and Type III OI in severity  bones easily fractured (most fractures occur before puberty)  smaller than average stature  sclera normal in color (i.e., white or near-white)  mild to moderate bone deformity  tendency toward spinal curvature  barrel-shaped rib cage  triangular face  possible brittle teeth  possible hearing loss  improperly formed collagen  By studying the appearance of OI bone under the microscope, investigators noticed that some people who are clinically within the Type IV group had a distinct pattern to their bone. When they reviewed the full medical history of these people, they found the groups had other features in common. They named these groups Type V and Type VI OI. The mutations causing these forms of OI have not been identified, but people in these two groups do not have mutations in the type 1 collagen genes.  Type V OI  clinically similar to Type IV OI in appearance and symptoms  a dense band seen on x-rays adjacent to the growth plate of the long bones  unusually large calluses, called hypertrophic calluses, at the sites of fractures or surgical procedures (A callus is an area of new bone that is laid down at the fracture site as part of the healing process.)  calcification of the membrane between the radius and ulna (the bones of the forearm), which leads to restriction of forearm rotation  sclera normal in color (i.e., white or near-white)  normal teeth “mesh-like” appearance to bone when viewed under the microscope  dominant inheritance pattern  Type VI OI  clinically similar to Type IV OI in appearance and symptoms, but is extremely rare  slightly elevated activity level of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme linked to bone formation), which can be determined by a blood test  distinctive “fish-scale” appearance to bone when viewed under the microscope  diagnosed by bone biopsy  unknown whether this form is inherited in a dominant or recessive manner, but researchers believe the mode of inheritance is most likely recessive  New Recessive Forms of OI  After years of research, in 2006, scientists discovered two forms of OI that are inherited in a recessive manner. Genes that affect collagen formation cause both types. The discovery of these new forms of OI provides information for people who have severe or moderately severe OI but do not have a primary collagen mutation.  Type VII OI  resembles Type IV OI in many aspects of appearance and symptoms in the first described cases  in other instances, similar appearance and symptoms to Type II lethal OI, except infants had white sclera, a small head, and a round face  small stature  short humerus (arm bone) and short femur (upper leg bone)  coxa vara (a deformed hip joint in which the neck of the femur is bent downward) is common; the acutely angled femur head affects the hip socket  results from recessive inheritance of a mutation in the CRTAP gene. Partial (10 percent) expression of CRTAP leads to moderate bone dysplasia. Total absence of the cartilage-associated protein has been lethal in all identified cases  Type VIII OI  resembles lethal Type II or Type III OI in appearance and symptoms, except infants have white sclera  severe growth deficiency  extreme skeletal undermineralization  caused by absence or severe deficiency of prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity due to mutations in the LEPRE1 gene  Inheritance Factors  Most cases of OI (85 to 90 percent) are caused by a dominant genetic defect. This means that only one copy of the mutation-carrying gene is necessary for the child to have OI. A person with a form of OI caused by a dominant mutation has a 50 percent chance of passing on the disorder to each of his or her children.  Some children who have the dominant form of OI inherit the disorder from a parent. Other children are born with the dominant form of OI even though there is no family history of the disorder. In these children, the genetic defect occurred as a spontaneous mutation.  Approximately 10 to 15 percent of OI cases are the result of a recessive mutation. In this situation, the parents do not have OI, but both carry the mutation in their genes. To inherit recessive OI, the child must receive a copy of the mutation from both parents.  The parents of a child with recessive OI have a 25-percent chance per pregnancy of having another child with OI. Siblings of a person with recessive OI have a 50-percent chance of being a carrier of the recessive gene. DNA testing is available to help parents and siblings determine if they are carriers of this type of gene mutation.  If one parent has OI because of a recessive mutation, 100 percent of their children will be carriers of the recessive OI mutation. Whether any of these children will have OI will depend on the genes inherited from the other parent. Genetic counselors can help people with OI and their family members understand OI genetics and the possibility of recurrence, and they can assist in prenatal diagnosis for those who wish to exercise that option. For more information on OI inheritance, see the fact sheet, Genetics , from the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation.  Treatment  There is not yet a cure for OI. Treatment is directed toward preventing or controlling the symptoms, maximizing independent mobility, and developing optimal bone mass and muscle strength. Care of fractures, extensive surgical and dental procedures, and physical therapy are often recommended for people with OI. Use of wheelchairs, braces, and other mobility aids is common, particularly (although not exclusively) among people with more severe types of OI.  Doctors frequently consider a surgical procedure called “rodding” for people with OI. This treatment involves inserting metal rods through the length of the long bones to strengthen them. The treatment also prevents or corrects deformities. For more information, see the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation’s fact sheet, Rodding Surgery .  Scientists are exploring several medications and other treatments for their potential use to treat OI. These include growth hormone treatment, intravenous and oral drugs called bisphosphonates, an injected drug called teriparatide (for adults only), and gene therapies. It is not clear whether people with recessive OI and those with dominant OI will respond to these treatments in the same manner. The OI Foundation can provide current information on research studies and experimental treatments to help individuals with OI decide whether to participate in clinical trials.  People with OI are encouraged to exercise as much as possible to promote muscle and bone strength, which can help prevent fractures. Swimming and water therapy are common exercise choices for people with OI, as water allows independent movement with little risk of fracture. For those who are able, walking (with or without mobility aids) is excellent exercise. People with OI should consult their doctor or physical therapist to discuss appropriate and safe exercise.  Children and adults with OI also will benefit from maintaining a healthy weight, eating a nutritious diet, and avoiding activities such as smoking, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption, and taking steroid medications—all of which may deplete bone and exacerbate bone fragility. For more information on nutrition, see the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation’s fact sheet, Nutrition .  Prognosis  The prognosis for a person with OI varies greatly depending on the number and severity of symptoms. Respiratory failure is the most frequent cause of death for people with OI, followed by accidental trauma. Despite numerous fractures, restricted activity, and small stature, most adults and children with OI lead productive and successful lives. They attend school, develop friendships and other relationships, have careers, raise families, participate in sports and other recreational activities, and are active members of their communities.

What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  NHGRI Research on Osteogenesis imperfecta  Additional Resources on Osteogenesis imperfecta   What is Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes a person's bones to break easily, often from little or no apparent trauma. OI is also called "brittle bone disease." OI varies in severity from person to person, ranging from a mild type to a severe type that causes death before or shortly after birth. In addition to having fractures, people with OI also have teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), and hearing loss when they are adults. People who have OI may also have muscle weakness, loose joints (joint laxity) and skeletal malformations.  OI occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals, including people diagnosed after birth. OI occurs with equal frequency among males and females and among racial and ethnic groups. Life expectancy varies depending on how severe the OI is, ranging from very brief (lethal form, OI type II) to average.  There are four well-known types of OI. These types are distinguished mostly by fracture frequency and severity and by characteristic features. Three additional types of OI (type V, VI and VII) have also been identified.  The vast majority (90 percent) of OI is caused by a single dominant mutation in one of two type I collagen genes: COL1A1 or COL1A2 .The COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to create a larger molecule called type I collagen. This type of collagen is the most common protein in bone, skin and other tissues that provide structure and strength to the body (connective tissues). OI type VII is caused by recessive mutations in the CRTAP gene.  Top of page  What are the symptoms of Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) causes bones to be fragile and easily broken and is also responsible for other health problems.  Type I OI is the mildest form of the condition. People who have type I OI have bone fractures during childhood and adolescence often due to minor trauma When these individuals reach adulthood they have fewer fractures.  Type II OI is the most severe form of OI. Infants with type II have bones that appear bent or crumpled and fractured before birth. Their chest is narrow and they have fractured and misshapen ribs and underdeveloped lungs. These infants have short, bowed arms and legs; hips that turn outward; and unusually soft skull bones. Most infants with type II OI are stillborn or die shortly after birth, usually from breathing failure.  Type III OI also has relatively severe signs and symptoms. Infants with OI type III have very soft and fragile bones that may begin to fracture before birth or in early infancy. Some infants have rib fractures that can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. Bone abnormalities tend to get worse over time and often interfere with the ability to walk.  Type IV OI is the most variable form OI. Symptoms of OI type IV can range from mild to severe. About 25 percent of infants with OI type IV are born with bone fractures. Others may not have broken bones until later in childhood or adulthood. Infants with OI type IV have leg bones that are bowed at birth, but bowing usually lessens as they get older.  Some types of OI are also associated with progressive hearing loss, a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and loose joints. People with this condition may have other bone abnormalities and are often shorter in stature than average.  Top of page  How is Osteogenesis imperfecta diagnosed?  OI is often inherited from an affected parent. The diagnosis of OI is made on the basis of family history and/or clinical presentation. Frequent fractures, short stature, a blue hue to the white part of the eye (blue sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta) and hearing loss that progresses after puberty may be present.  X-rays are also used to diagnose OI. X-ray findings include fractures that are at different stages of healing; an unexpected skull bone pattern called Wormian bones; and bones in the spine called "codfish vertebrae."  Laboratory testing for OI may include either biochemical testing or DNA-based sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 . Biochemical testing involves studying collagens taken from a small skin biopsy. Changes in type I collagen are an indication of OI.  DNA sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 is used to identify the type I collagen gene mutation responsible for the altered collagen protein. DNA testing requires a blood sample for DNA extraction. Both tests are relatively sensitive, detecting approximately 90 percent and 95 percent, respectively, of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of OI. Normal biochemical and molecular testing in a child with OI warrants additional testing of less common collagen genes ( CRTAP and P3H (LEPRE1) ) responsible for some of the rare recessive forms of OI.  Top of page  What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  There is currently no cure for OI. Treatment involves supportive therapy to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities, help with independent living and maintain overall health. OI is best managed by a medical team including the child's own doctor, and genetic, orthopedic and rehabilitation medicine. Supportive therapy is unique to each individual depending on the severity of their condition and their age.  Physical and occupational therapies to help improve their ability to move, to prevent fractures and to increase muscle strength are often useful.  Fractures are treated as they would be in children and adults who do not have OI. An orthopedic treatment called intramedullary rodding (placing rods in the bones) is used to help with positioning of legs that helps with more normal functioning when necessary.  A newer treatment with medication called biophosphonates is being used to help with bone formation and to decrease the need for surgery.  Top of page  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  Most types of OI are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Almost all infants with the severe type II OI are born into families without a family history of the condition. Usually, the cause in these families is a new mutation in the egg or sperm or very early embryo in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. In the milder forms of OI, 25-30 percent of cases occur as a result of new mutations. The other cases are inherited from a parent who has the condition. Whether a person has OI due to a new mutation or an inherited genetic change, an adult with the disorder can pass the condition down to future generations.  In autosomal dominant inherited OI, a parent who has OI has one copy of a gene mutation that causes OI. With each of his/her pregnancies, there is a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the OI gene mutation to a child who would have OI, and a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the normal version of the gene to a child who would not have OI.  Rarely, OI can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder.

Other times, the IO is not inherited, but is caused by a mutation. In this case, neither parent shows no sign of OI. The mutation is again dominant inheritance.  And a particularly complicated is the possibility of mosaicism. Because of all this complexity, it is recommended to seek genetic counseling staff.  The Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a disease of genetic type, and therefore is hereditary. Types I and IV sometimes appear in families over several generations. The kind of inheritance is dominant: a parent or medre affected has a 50% chance of transmitting the altered gene to each child, and another 50% to transmit the gene-altered (all of us have two copies of each gene, except for the genes linked to the chromosomes that carry the legacy sex).  Although there is some degree of variation between affected family members (eg number of fractures), the clinical classification of the disease in each affected family is generally the same throughout the generations, as it is the same genetic defect that passed on from father to son.  Moreover, the O.I. Is a very heterogeneous among cases without family relationship: the individual case may be a genetic defect in different genes that carry the information of collagen.  The RO, like other dominant genetic diseases may occur spontaneously. This is particularly true in types II and III, which are typically more severe forms of OI, but it may occur in other cases. When a child is born / a parent is not affected because it usually has appeared a mutation in a gene of collagen. Mutations are sporadic and unpredictable changes in the genetic information carried by DNA. It is most likely that the mutation occurred in one of the two gametes (egg or sperm), whose union leads the child to affected / a.  In those families in which appears a case of spontaneous OI The siblings unaffected citizens are not carriers of the mutation, therefore, the children of those do not have a particular genetic risk of having the disease, by contrast, a child affected is a student with a probability of 50% convey the mutant gene, and thus the disease to their own children, starting a new chain of genetic inheritance, with 50% probability, over new generations.  With regard to the parents, studies in a large number of families with children born with OI type II (lethal) parents not affected, it has shown a certain recurrence of the disease (ie, new children with OI) , in a 5 to 7% of cases.  This strange situation was explained wrongly long with a different type of genetic inheritance (autosomal recessive), and even today can lead to confusion (and therefore, a genetic counseling wrong) to physicians who are not fully up to date in terms to new research on the IO Peter Byers and his colleagues at the University of Seattle, USA, and subsequently many other researchers have shown that the recurrence of cases of OI Families with no previous cases of this disease is caused by mutations in one of the dominant genes of collagen (COL1A1 and COL1A2): spontaneous mutation, rather than affect a single cigoto (egg or sperm), has affected a certain portion of them in the parent, who, therefore, has a certain probability of breed more than one child affected by the disease.  This phenomenon is called mosaicism.  It is very difficult to diagnose cases of mosaicism: find the mutation in their cells could be worse than find the needle in the haystack. Only after the mutation has been identified in the child / concerned / a, which the carrier in all its cells, it is possible to design molecular analysis to try to seek mosaicism in parents (usually in ova and / or sperm, and also in the white blood cells), and then, try to estimate the theoretical probability of repeat child with OI.  The mosaicism may occur in any type of OI, but so far has only been documented for more severe types of the disease (type II), and their frequency has been experimentally estimated between 5 and 7%.

      bones are formed improperly, making them fragile and prone to breaking.    Description          Collagen is a fibrous protein material that serves as the structural
      foundation of skin, bone, cartilage, and ligaments. In osteogenesis
      imperfecta, the collagen produced is abnormal and disorganized, which
      results in a number of abnormalities throughout the body, the most notable
      being fragile, easily broken bones.  There are four forms of OI, types I through IV. Of these, type II is the
      most severe and is usually fatal within a short time after birth. Types I,
      III, and IV have some overlapping and some distinctive symptoms, with the
      hallmark symptom being fragile bones.  OI is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. In autosomal
      dominant inheritance, a single abnormal gene on one of the autosomal
      chromosomes (one of the first 22 non-sex chromosomes) from either parent
      can cause the disease. Only one parent needs to be a carrier in order for
      the child to inherit the disease. The parent affected by OI will have one
      abnormal gene and one normal gene. A child who has one parent with the
      disease therefore has a 50 percent chance of also inheriting the disease.  If both parents have OI caused by an autosomal dominant gene change, there
      is a 75 percent chance that the child will inherit one or both OI genes.
      In other words, there is a 25 percent chance of inheriting a faulty gene
      from the mother and a normal gene from the father, a 25 percent chance of
      inheriting a normal gene from the mother and a faulty gene from the
      father, a 25 percent chance of inheriting faulty genes from both parents,
      and a 25 percent chance of inheriting normal genes from both parents. It
      is difficult to predict the severity of OI in a child who has inherited
      two copies of the faulty gene because of its rarity.  There is no  family  history of OI in about 25 percent of children born with the disease. This
      occurs as a result of a spontaneous mutation of the gene in either the
      sperm or egg. The cause of such mutations is not known. Called new
      dominant mutation, the affected child subsequently has a 50 percent of
      passing the abnormal gene to his or her children. The risk of normal
      parents having a second child with OI, or of normal siblings going on to
      have affected children, does not appear to be greater than that of the
      general population.  In studies of families into which infants with OI type II were born, most
      of the babies had a new dominant mutation in a collagen gene. In some of
      these families, however, more than one infant was born with OI.
      Previously, researchers had seen this recurrence as evidence of recessive
      inheritance of OI type II. Subsequently, however, researchers concluded
      that the rare recurrence 
       of OI to a couple with a child with autosomal dominant OI is more likely
      due to gonadal mosaicism. Instead of mutation occurring in an individual
      sperm or egg, it occurs in a percentage of the cells that give rise to a
      parent's multiple sperm or eggs. This mutation, present in a
      percentage of his or her reproductive cells, can result in more than one
      affected child without affecting the parent with the disorder. An
      estimated 2 percent to 4 percent of families into which an infant with OI
      type II is born are at risk of having another affected child because of
      gonadal mosaicism.    Demographics  OI affects equal numbers of males and females. It occurs in about one of
      every 20,000 births.    Causes and symptoms  Evidence suggests that OI results from abnormalities in the collagen gene
      COL1A1 or COL1A2 and possibly abnormalities in other genes. In OI, the
      genetic abnormality causes one of two things to occur. It may direct cells
      to make an altered collagen protein and the presence of this altered
      collagen causes OI type II, III, or IV. Alternately, the dominant altered
      gene may fail to direct cells to make any collagen protein. Although some
      collagen is produced by instructions from the normal gene, an overall
      decrease in the total amount of collagen produced results in OI type I.    Type I  OI type I is the most common and mildest type. Among the common features
      of type I are the following:   Bones are predisposed to fracture, with most  fractures  occurring before  puberty  ; people with OI type I typically have about 20 to 40 fractures before
        puberty.  Stature is normal or near-normal.  Joints are loose and muscle tone is low.  Sclerae (whites of the eyes) have blue, purple, or gray tint.  Face shape is triangular.  Tendency toward  scoliosis  (a curvature of the spine) is present.  Bone deformity is absent or minimal.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur, causing brittle teeth.  Hearing loss is a possible symptom, often beginning in early 20s or 30s.  Structure of collagen is normal but the amount is lower than normal.     Type II  Sometimes called the lethal form, type II is the most severe form of OI.
      Among the common features of type II are the following:   Frequently, OI type II is lethal at or shortly after birth, often as a
        result of respiratory problems.  Fractures are numerous and bone deformity is severe.  Stature is small with underdeveloped lungs.  Collagen is formed improperly.     Type III  Among the common features of type III are the following:   Bones fracture easily (Fractures are often present at birth, and x rays
        may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth; people with OI
        type III may have more than 100 fractures before puberty.)  Stature is significantly shorter than normal.  Sclerae have blue, purple, or gray tint.  Joints are loose and muscle development is poor in arms and legs.  Rib cage is barrel-shaped.  Face shape is triangular.  Scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) is present.  Respiratory problems are possible.  Bones are deformed and deformity is often severe.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur.  Hearing loss is possible.  Collagen is formed improperly.     Type IV  OI type IV falls between type I and type III in severity. Among the common
      features of type IV are the following:   Bones fracture easily, with most fractures occurring before puberty.  Stature is shorter than average.  Sclerae are normal in color, appearing white or near-white.  Bone deformity is mild to moderate.  Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) is likely.  Rib cage is barrel-shaped.  Face is triangular.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur.  Hearing loss is possible.  Collagen is formed improperly.     When to call the doctor  Parents should contact a healthcare professional if their child exhibits
      any of the symptoms of OI, particularly a tendency to fracture bones
      easily.    Diagnosis  It is often possible to diagnose OI solely on clinical features and x-ray
      findings. Collagen or DNA tests may help confirm a diagnosis of OI; test
      results may take several weeks to confirm. Approximately 10 to 15 percent
      of individuals with mild OI who have collagen testing, and approximately 5
      percent of those who have genetic testing, test negative for OI despite
      having the disorder.  Diagnosis is usually suspected when a baby has bone fractures after having
      suffered no apparent injury. Another indication is small, irregular,
      isolated bones in the sutures between the bones of the skull (wormian
      bones). Sometimes the bluish sclerae serve as a diagnostic clue.
      Unfortunately, because of the unusual nature of the fractures occurring in
      a baby who is not yet mobile, some parents have been accused of  child abuse  before the actual diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta was reached.    Prenatal diagnosis  Testing is available to assist in prenatal diagnosis. Women with OI who
      become pregnant or women who conceive a child with a man who has OI may
      wish to explore prenatal diagnosis. Because of the relatively small risk
      (2–4%) of recurrence of OI type II in a family, families may opt
      for ultrasound studies to determine if a developing fetus has the
      disorder.  Ultrasound is the least invasive procedure for prenatal diagnosis and
      carries the least risk. Using ultrasound, a doctor can examine the
      fetus's skeleton for bowing of the leg or arm bones, fractures,
      shortening, or other bone abnormalities that may indicate OI. Different
      forms of OI may be detected by ultrasound in the second trimester. When OI
      occurs as a new dominant mutation and is found inadvertently on
      ultrasound, it may be difficult to confirm the diagnosis until after
      delivery since other genetic conditions can cause bowing and/or fractures
      prenatally.  Chorionic villus sampling is a procedure that obtains a sampling of cells
      from the placenta for testing. Examination of fetal collagen proteins in
      the tissue can reveal information about the quantitative or qualitative
      collagen defects that leads to OI. When a parent has OI, it is necessary
      for the affected parent to have the results of his or her own collagen
      test available. Chorionic villus sampling can be performed at ten to 12
      weeks of pregnancy.   Amniocentesis is a procedure that involves inserting a thin needle into the uterus,
      into the amniotic sac, and withdrawing a small amount of amniotic fluid.
      Genetic material can be extracted from the fetal cells contained in the
      amniotic fluid and tested for the specific mutation known to cause OI in
      that family. This technique is useful only when the mutation causing OI in
      a particular family has been identified through previous genetic testing
      of affected family members, including previous pregnancies involving a
      baby with OI. Amniocentesis is performed at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy.    Treatment  There are no treatments available to cure OI, nor to prevent most of its
      complications. Most treatments are aimed at treating the fractures and
      bone deformities caused by OI. Splints, casts, braces, and rods are all
      used. Rodding is a surgical procedure in which a metal rod is implanted
      within a bone (usually the long bones of the thigh and leg). This surgery
      is performed when bowing or repeated fractures of these bones has
      interfered with a child's ability to walk.  Other treatments include hearing aids and early capping of teeth. Patients
      may require the use of a walker or wheelchair. Pain may be treated with a variety of medications. Exercise is encouraged as a means to promote muscle and bone strength. Swimming is
      a form of exercise that puts a minimal amount of strain on muscles,
      joints, and bones. Walking is encouraged for those who are able.    Alternative treatment  Alternative treatment such as acupuncture, naturopathic therapies,
      hypnosis, relaxation training, visual imagery, and biofeedback have all
      been used to try to decrease the constant pain of fractures.    Nutritional concerns   Smoking , excessive alcohol and  caffeine  consumption, and steroid medications may deplete bone and exacerbate bone
      fragility.    Prognosis  The lifespan of people with OI types I, III, and IV is not generally
      shortened. The prognosis for people with these types of OI is quite
      variable, depending on the severity of the disorder and the number and
      severity of the fractures and bony deformities.  Fifty percent of all babies with OI type II are stillborn. The rest of
      these babies usually die within a very short time after birth. In the
      early 2000s, some people with type II have lived into young adulthood.    Prevention  As a congenital birth defect, OI cannot be prevented. Individuals at risk
      of having a child with OI should be encouraged to undergo genetic
      counseling to more accurately determine their chances of having a child
      with OI. The risk of fractures can be minimized with bone- and
      muscle-strengthening exercises, rehabilitative therapy, and use of leg
      braces.    Nutritional concerns  Because the symptoms of OI are caused by collagen abnormalities and not a
      calcium deficiency (such as in osteoporosis), supplementation of  vitamins  or  minerals  will not cure the disease. To prevent bone loss related to calcium
      deficiency, which could exacerbate the fragility of bones, it is important
      that children with OI consume an adequate amount of calcium (generally 500
      mg for children ages one to three, 800 mg for children ages four to eight,
      and 1,300 mg a day for preteens and teenagers).    Parental concerns  In cases in which OI is not diagnosed at birth, a child may experience
      numerous fractures of seemingly unexplained cause, leading healthcare
      providers to suspect the child is being abused. Once a child has been
      diagnosed, it may be helpful for parents to carry with them a letter from
      the child's healthcare provider detailing the diagnosis in order to
      facilitate care in an emergency.   KEY TERMS   Chromosome —A microscopic thread-like structure found within each cell of
        the human body and consisting of a complex of proteins and DNA. Humans

        genetic information necessary to direct the development and functioning
        of all cells and systems in the body. They pass on hereditary traits
        from parents to child (like eye color) and determine whether the child
        will be male or female.   Collagen —The main supportive protein of cartilage, connective tissue,
        tendon, skin, and bone.   Ligament —A type of tough, fibrous tissue that connects bones or cartilage

Families should seek counseling from a qualified physician or genetics clinic.)  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is the result of a mutation in one of the two genes that carry instructions for making type 1 collagen (the major protein in bone and skin). The mutation may result in either a change in the structure of type 1 collagen molecules, or in the number of collagen molecules made. Either of these changes results in weak bones that fracture easily.  In recent years, researchers have studied skin cells, the collagen molecules they make, and the genes themselves from individuals with different forms of OI. Results of these studies show that the great majority of people with OI, even those who are the only affected person in a family, have dominantly inherited forms of the disorder.  How Genes Work Genes are units of hereditary material (DNA) that tell the cells in our bodies how to function. We receive two copies of each gene--one from each parent. Most of the time, genes function the way they are supposed to. However, genes can sometimes be altered by a mutation , in which there is a change in the structure of the gene's DNA. When a mutation occurs, it can disrupt the normal function of a gene.  Dominant Inheritance Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta involve a dominant mutation . When a gene with a dominant mutation is paired with a normal gene, the faulty gene "dominates" the normal gene. In OI, a dominant genetic defect causes one of two things to occur:   The dominant altered gene directs cells to make an altered collagen protein. Even though the normal gene directs cells to make normal collagen, the presence of altered collagen causes Type II, III, or IV OI. These types result from a problem with the quality of collagen.  The dominant altered gene fails to direct cells to make any collagen protein. Although some collagen is produced by instructions from the normal gene, there is an overall decrease in the total amount of collagen produced, resulting in Type I OI. This type results from a problem with the quantity of collagen.  When a mutation is dominant, a person only has to receive one faulty gene to have a genetic disorder. This is the case with most people who have OI: they have one faulty gene for type 1 collagen, and one normal gene for type 1 collagen.  Recessive Inheritance With recessive inheritance, both copies of a gene must be defective for a person to have a genetic disorder. This occurs when both parents carry a single altered copy of the gene. The parents do not have the genetic disorder (because they have only one faulty gene), but they are carriers of the disorder. With each pregnancy, there is a 25 percent chance that the child will receive two altered genes, one from each parent. In this case, the child would have the genetic disorder. There is a 50 percent chance that the child will receive only one altered gene, in which case he or she will be a carrier (like his or her parents), but not have the disorder. Most researchers now agree that recessive inheritance rarely causes osteogenesis imperfecta.  OI in Families There are essentially three scenarios that occur to cause a child to be born with osteogenesis imperfecta.   Direct Inheritance from a Parent   A person with OI has two genes for type 1 collagen--one gene is faulty, the other is normal. Each time that person conceives a child, he or she passes on one of the two genes to the child. Therefore, there is a 50 percent chance that his or her child will inherit the faulty gene. If the child inherits the faulty gene, he or she will have the same type of OI as the parent. However, the child may be affected in different ways than the parent (e.g., the child's number of fractures, level of mobility, stature, etc. may not be identical to his or her parent's).  If the parent with OI passes on his or her normal gene to a child, that child will not have OI and cannot pass on the disorder to his or her own children.  A New Dominant Mutation   About 25 percent of children with OI are born into a family with no history of the disorder. That is, a child is born with a dominant genetic mutation that causes OI, yet neither parent has OI. This occurs when the child has a "new" or "spontaneous" dominant mutation. The gene spontaneously mutated in either the sperm or the egg before the child's conception. Now that the child has a dominant gene for OI, he or she has a 50 percent chance of passing the disorder on to his or her children, as explained above.  As far as we know, nothing the parents did caused a spontaneous mutation to occur. There are no known environmental, dietary, or behavioral triggers for this type of mutation.  In most cases, when a family with no history of OI has a child with OI, they are not at any greater risk than the general population for having a second child with OI. (For the exception to this rule, see "Mosaicism" below.) In addition, unaffected siblings of a person with OI are at no greater risk of having children with OI than the general population.  Mosaicism   In studies of families into which infants with OI Type II (the perinatal lethal form) were born, it was found that most of the babies had a new dominant mutation in a collagen gene. However, in some of these families, more than one infant was born with OI. Previously, researchers had seen this recurrence as evidence of recessive inheritance of this form of OI. More recently, however, researchers have concluded that the rare recurrence of OI in a previously unaffected family is more likely due to a phenomenon called mosaicism. Studies suggested that the mutation, instead of occurring in an individual sperm or egg, occurred in a percentage of the cells that give rise to a parent's multiple sperm or eggs . Thus, although the parent is not affected by the disorder, the mutation present in a percentage of his or her reproductive cells can result in more than one affected child. It is estimated that 2 to 4 percent of families into which an infant with OI Type II is born are at risk of having another affected child because of this problem with sperm or eggs. When Both Parents Have OI If two people with OI have a child, there is a 75 percent chance that the child will inherit one or both OI genes, as follows: There is a 25 percent chance the child will inherit only the mother's OI gene (and the father's unaffected gene), a 25 percent chance the child will inherit only the father's OI gene (and the mother's unaffected gene), and a 25 percent chance the child will inherit both parents' OI genes. Because this situation has been uncommon, the outcome of a child inheriting two OI genes is hard to predict. It is likely (even if both parents have mild OI) that the child would have a severe, possibly lethal, form of the disorder. Prenatal Diagnosis Testing is available to help families further understand what type of OI someone has, provide some insight into the natural history of the condition (i.e., what the family can expect), and assist in prenatal diagnosis for families who wish to exercise that option. One of these tests examines collagen proteins to look for the quantitative or qualitative collagen defects that lead to OI. A second test is done directly on DNA obtained from a blood sample, and looks for a genetic mutation that causes OI. Because of the relatively small 2 to 4 percent risk of recurrence of Type II OI in a family, many genetic centers now recommend very early ultrasound studies to determine if a developing fetus has the disorder. Women with OI who become pregnant, or women who conceive a child with a man who has OI, may also want to explore prenatal diagnosis. Undergoing prenatal diagnosis does not obligate parents to elect pregnancy termination, and the information obtained may be useful in managing pregnancy and delivery.  Ultrasound  is the least invasive procedure for prenatal diagnosis, and therefore carries the least risk. Using ultrasound, a doctor can examine the fetus' skeleton for bowing (bending of the leg or arm bones), fractures, shortening, or other bone abnormalities that may indicate OI. Type II OI is usually identifiable by 14 to 16 weeks gestation, and Type III by 16 to 18 weeks gestation. Though ultrasound has been used occasionally to diagnose milder forms of OI, mild OI is often not detected until late in the pregnancy, if at all. There are different levels of ultrasound, some of which are more useful than others for detecting OI in a fetus. Even when ultrasound is performed by a highly qualified ultrasonographer, it may be difficult to accurately pinpoint the type of OI before birth.  Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) examines placental cells, and, under some circumstances, can be used to detect abnormal collagen proteins or a genetic mutation that indicates that the fetus has OI. CVS can be performed at 10 to 14 weeks gestation. There is a 1 percent risk of miscarriage associated with CVS.  Amniocentesis examines fetal cells shed into the amniotic fluid. Because these cells carry all the genes that a fetus has inherited, amniocentesis can be used to look for a genetic mutation that causes OI. This technique is most useful when the mutation causing OI in a particular family has been identified through previous genetic testing of affected family members, including previous pregnancies involving a baby with OI. Amniocentesis is performed at 15 to 18 weeks gestation, and there is a 1 in 200 risk of miscarriage associated with the procedure. Various circumstances affect the usefulness and accuracy of these tests. Not all types of tests are available in all geographic areas. When CVS or amniocentesis are used to attempt prenatal diagnosis of a fetus who has a parent with OI, it is helpful for the affected parent to have the results of his or her own collagen or DNA test available. Families are encouraged to discuss these techniques with their physician, as well as a geneticist and/or genetic counselor, to learn more about which techniques are appropriate for their situation.

Description        Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The term " osteogenesis imperfecta " means imperfect bone formation. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth.  Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes.  Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta . The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma.  Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma.  Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta .  The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.            Enlarge          Frequency        This condition affects an estimated 6 to 7 per 100,000 people worldwide.  Types I and IV are the most common forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , affecting 4 to 5 per 100,000 people.      Related Information    What information about a genetic condition can statistics provide? Why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethnic groups?          Genetic Changes        Mutations in the COL1A1 , COL1A2 , CRTAP , and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type I collagen.  This type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body. Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily.  The mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  These mutations typically alter the structure of type I collagen molecules.  A defect in the structure of type I collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the CRTAP and P3H1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  Cases caused by CRTAP mutations are usually classified as type VII; when P3H1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type VIII.  The proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. Mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. These defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth. In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. These cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types V and VI.  Researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.

How can gene mutations affect health and development? More about Mutations and Health          Inheritance Pattern        Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta  inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered.  The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene.  Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .  When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

[1] It results in bones that break easily. [1] The severity may be mild to severe. [1] Other symptoms may include a blue tinge to the whites of the eye , short height, loose joints , hearing loss , breathing problems and problems with the teeth. [1] [3] Complications may include cervical artery dissection and aortic dissection . [5] [6] [7]  The underlying mechanism is usually a problem with connective tissue due to a lack of type I collagen . [1] This occurs in more than 90% of cases due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. [1] These genetic problems are often inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner or occur via a new mutation. [1] There are eight types, with type I being the least severe and type II the most severe. [1] Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and may be confirmed by collagen or DNA testing . [3]  There is no cure. [3] Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures. [4] Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy , braces or wheelchairs and surgery. [4] A type of surgery that puts metal rods through long bones may be done to strengthen them. [4] Tentative evidence supports the use of medications of the bisphosphonate type. [8] [9]  OI affects about one in 15,000 people. [1] Outcomes depend on the type of disease. [3] Most people, however, have good outcomes. [3] The condition has been described since ancient history. [10] The term "osteogenesis imperfecta" came into use in 1895 and means imperfect bone formation.

Bones fracture easily  Slight spinal curvature  Loose joints  Poor muscle tone  Discoloration of the sclera (whites of the eyes), usually giving them a blue-gray color. The blue-gray color of the sclera is due to the underlying choroidal veins which show through. This is due to the sclera being thinner than normal because the defective Type I collagen is not forming correctly.  Early loss of hearing in some children [13]  Slight protrusion of the eyes   IA and IB are defined to be distinguished by the absence/presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (characterized by opalescent teeth; absent in IA, present in IB). Life expectancy is slightly reduced compared to the general population due to the possibility of fatal bone fractures and complications related to OI Type I such as basilar invagination . [ citation needed ]  Type II [ edit ]  Collagen is not of a sufficient quality or quantity.   Most cases die within the first year of life due to respiratory failure or intracerebral hemorrhage  Severe respiratory problems due to underdeveloped lungs  Severe bone deformity and small stature   Type II can be further subclassified into groups A, B, and C, which are distinguished by radiographic evaluation of the long bones and ribs. Type IIA demonstrates broad and short long bones with broad and beaded ribs. Type IIB demonstrates broad and short long bones with thin ribs that have little or no beading. Type IIC demonstrates thin and longer long bones with thin and beaded ribs.  Type III [ edit ]  Collagen improperly formed, enough collagen is made but it is defective.   Bones fracture easily, sometimes even before birth  Bone deformity, often severe  Respiratory problems possible  Short stature, spinal curvature and sometimes barrel-shaped rib cage  Triangular face [14]  Loose joints (double-jointed)  Poor muscle tone in arms and legs  Discolouration of the sclera (the 'whites' of the eyes are blue)  Early loss of hearing possible   Type III is distinguished among the other classifications as being the "progressive deforming" type, wherein a neonate presents with mild symptoms at birth and develops the aforementioned symptoms throughout life. Lifespans may be normal, albeit with severe physical handicapping.  Type IV [ edit ]  Collagen quantity is sufficient but is not of a high enough quality   Bones fracture easily, especially before puberty  Short stature, spinal curvature, and barrel-shaped rib cage  Bone deformity is mild to moderate  Early loss of hearing   Similar to Type I, Type IV can be further subclassified into types IVA and IVB characterized by absence (IVA) or presence (IVB) of dentinogenesis imperfecta .  Type V [ edit ]     OI Type V in an adult       OI Type V in a child    Having the same clinical features as Type IV, it is distinguished histologically by "mesh-like" bone appearance. Further characterized by the "V triad" consisting of a) radio-opaque band adjacent to growth plates, b) hypertrophic calluses at fracture sites, and c) calcification of the radio - ulnar  interosseous membrane . [15]  OI Type V leads to calcification of the membrane between the two forearm bones, making it difficult to turn the wrist. Another symptom is abnormally large amounts of repair tissue ( hyperplasic callus) at the site of fractures. Other features of this condition include radial head dislocation, long bone bowing, and mixed hearing loss.  At least some cases of this type are caused by mutations in the IFITM5 gene. [12]  Type VI [ edit ]  With the same clinical features as Type IV, it is distinguished histologically by "fish-scale" bone appearance. Type VI has recently been found to be caused by a loss of function mutation in the SERPINF1 gene. SERPINF1 , a member of the serpin family, is also known as pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), the most powerful endogenous antiangiogenic factor in mammals.  Type VII [ edit ]  In 2006, a recessive form called "Type VII" was discovered (phenotype severe to lethal). Thus far it seems to be limited to a First Nations people in Quebec . [16] Mutations in the gene CRTAP causes this type. [17]  Type VIII [ edit ]  OI caused by mutation in the gene LEPRE1 is classified as type VIII. [17]  Other genes [ edit ]  A family with recessive osteogenesis imperfecta has been reported to have a mutation in the TMEM38B gene on chromosome 9 . [18] This gene encodes TRIC-B, a component of TRIC, a monovalent cation -specific channel involved in calcium release from intracellular stores.  It is extremely likely that there are other genes associated with this disease that have yet to be reported.  Pathophysiology [ edit ]  People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen . [19] This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen  triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. [20] As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. [21] Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. [20] These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.  As a genetic disorder, OI has historically been viewed as an autosomal dominant disorder of type I collagen. Most cases have been caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. In the past several years, there has been the identification of autosomal recessive forms. [22] Most people with OI receive it from a parent but in 35% of cases it is an individual ( de novo or "sporadic") mutation. [ citation needed ]  Diagnosis [ edit ]  Diagnosis is typically based on medical imaging, including plain Xrays, and symptoms. Signs on medical imaging include abnormalities in all extremeties and the spine. [23] An OI diagnosis can be confirmed through DNA or collagen testing, but in many cases the occurrence of bone fractures with little trauma and the presence of other clinical features such as blue sclera are sufficient for a diagnosis. A skin biopsy can be performed to determine the structure and quantity of type I collagen. DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis, however, it cannot exclude it because not all mutations causing OI are known and/or tested for. OI type II is often diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy, where already multiple fractures and other characteristic features may be present. Relative to control, OI cortical bone shows increased porosity, canal diameter, and connectivity in micro-computed tomography. [24]  An important differential diagnosis of OI is child abuse , as both may present with multiple fractures in various stages of healing. Differentiating them can be difficult, especially when no other characteristic features of OI are present. Other differential diagnoses include rickets , osteomalacia , and other rare skeletal syndromes.  Treatment [ edit ]  There is no cure. [3] Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures. Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy , braces or wheelchairs, and surgery. A type of surgery that puts metal rods through long bones may be done to strengthen them. [4]  Bone infections are treated as and when they occur with the appropriate antibiotics and antiseptics .  Bisphosphonates [ edit ]  In 1998, a clinical trial demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous pamidronate , a bisphosphonate which had previously been used in adults to treat osteoporosis. In severe OI, pamidronate reduced bone pain, prevented new vertebral fractures, reshaped previously fractured vertebral bodies, and reduced the number of long-bone fractures. [25]  Although oral bisphosphonates are more convenient and cheaper, they are not absorbed as well, and intravenous bisphosphonates are generally more effective, although this is under study. Some studies have found oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as oral alendronate and intravenous pamidronate, equivalent. [26] In a trial of children with mild OI, oral risedronate increased bone mineral densities, and reduced nonvertebral fractures. However, it did not decrease new vertebral fractures. [27] [28] A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that though bisphosphonates seem to improve bone mineral density, it is uncertain whether this leads to a reduction in fractures or an improvement in the quality of life of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. [9]  Bisphosphonates are less effective for OI in adults. [29]  Surgery [ edit ]  Metal rods can be surgically inserted in the long bones to improve strength, a procedure developed by Harold A. Sofield, MD, at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Chicago . During the late 1940s, Sofield, Chief of Staff at Shriners Hospitals in Chicago, worked there with large numbers of children with OI and experimented with various methods to strengthen the bones in these children. [30] In 1959, with Edward A. Miller, MD, Sofield wrote a seminal article describing a solution that seemed radical at the time: the placement of stainless steel rods into the intramedullary canals of the long bones to stabilize and strengthen them. His treatment proved extremely useful in the rehabilitation and prevention of fractures; it was adopted throughout the world and still forms the basis for orthopedic treatment of OI.  Spinal fusion can be performed to correct scoliosis , although the inherent bone fragility makes this operation more complex in OI patients. Surgery for basilar impressions can be carried out if pressure being exerted on the spinal cord and brain stem is causing neurological problems.  Physiotherapy [ edit ]  Physiotherapy is used to strengthen muscles and improve motility in a gentle manner, while minimizing the risk of fracture. This often involves hydrotherapy and the use of support cushions to improve posture. Individuals are encouraged to change positions regularly throughout the day to balance the muscles being used and the bones under pressure.  Children often develop a fear of trying new ways of moving due to movement being associated with pain. This can make physiotherapy difficult to administer to young children.  Physical aids [ edit ]  With adaptive equipment such as crutches , wheelchairs, splints, grabbing arms, or modifications to the home, many individuals with OI can maintain a significant degree of autonomy.  Teeth [ edit ]  More than 1 in 2 people with OI also have dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) - a congenital disorder of formation of dentine . [31] Dental treatment may pose as a challenge as a result of the various deformities, skeletal and dental, due to OI. Children with OI should go for a dental check-up as soon as their teeth erupt, this may minimize tooth structure loss as a result of abnormal dentine, and they should be monitored regularly to preserve their teeth and oral health. [31]  Many people with OI are treated with bisphosphonates, and there are several complications with dental procedures when a person is taking BP, namely bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ).  History [ edit ]  The condition, or types of it, has had various other names over the years and in different nations. Among some of the most common alternatives are Ekman-Lobstein syndrome, Vrolik syndrome, and the colloquial glass-bone disease. The name osteogenesis imperfecta dates to at least 1895 [32] and has been the usual medical term in the 20th century to present. The current four type system began with Sillence in 1979. [33] An older system deemed less severe types "osteogenesis imperfecta tarda" while more severe forms were deemed "osteogenesis imperfecta congenita." [34] As this terminology did not differentiate well between the types, and all forms of osteogenesis are congenital, this naming convention has since fallen out of favour.  The condition has been found in an ancient Egyptian  mummy from 1000 BC. The Norse  king  Ivar the Boneless may have had this condition, as well. The earliest studies of it began in 1788 with the Swede Olof Jakob Ekman. He described the condition in his doctoral thesis and mentioned cases of it going back to 1678. In 1831, Edmund Axmann described it in himself and two brothers. Jean Lobstein dealt with it in adults in 1833. Willem Vrolik did work on the condition in the 1850s. The idea that the adult and newborn forms were the same came in 1897 with Martin Benno Schmidt . [35]  Epidemiology [ edit ]  In the United States, the incidence of osteogenesis imperfecta is estimated to be one per 20,000 live births. [36] An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people are affected by OI in the United States.  Frequency is approximately the same across groups, but for unknown reasons, the Shona and Ndebele of Zimbabwe seem to have a higher proportion of Type III to Type I than other groups. [37] A similar pattern was found in segments of the Nigerian and South African populations. [ citation needed ] In these varied cases, the total number of OIs of all four types was roughly the same as any other ethnicity.  Society and culture [ edit ]  See also: List of people with osteogenesis imperfecta  The Brittle Bone Society is a UK charity that supports people with the condition.  Figures in film, television, video games and novels depicted as having osteogenesis imperfecta include:   Robby Novak (also known as Kid President), a motivational speaker and YouTube personality as of 2013. [38] He often comments on his own ability to overcome the disorder. [39]  Samuel L. Jackson 's fictional character Elijah Price in M. Night Shyamalan 's 2000 film Unbreakable and its 2019 follow-up Glass , who was born with type I osteogenesis imperfecta. [40]  Asa Butterfield 's fictional character Gardner Elliot in Peter Chelsom 's 2017 film The Space Between Us was born with osteogenesis imperfecta due to being born on the planet Mars . [41]  Jeff "Joker" Moreau, a fictional character from the Mass Effect video game series voiced by Seth Green . Given that the series is set in the fictional future, he is able to take medications to help with his disease and is a pilot. The medication, along with a mix of Cerberus implants and braces, allow him to walk and dance, although not as fluidly as others without the disease. [42]   Other animals [ edit ]  In dogs, OI is an autosomal-recessive condition. In Golden Retrievers, it is caused by a mutation in the COL1A1 , and in Beagles, the COL1A2 . A separate mutation in the SERPINH1 gene has been found to cause the condition in Dachshunds. [43] Several mouse models of OI have been described, whereby the abnormal gait 2 (AGA2) mouse line exhibits severe skeletal [44] and cardio-pulmonary [45] phenotypes due to a carboxy-terminus mutation in the COL1A1 gene in the mouse.

The specific symptoms and physical findings associated with OI vary greatly from case to case. The severity of OI also varies greatly, even among individuals of the same family. OI may be a mild disorder or may result in severe complications. Four main types of OI have been identified. OI type I is the most common and the mildest form of the disorder. OI type II is the most severe. In most cases, the various forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are inherited as autosomal dominant traits.     Signs & Symptoms  In all types of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, the associated symptoms vary greatly from case to case, even within families. Some affected individuals may not experience any bone fractures or only a few; other affected individuals may experience multiple fractures. OI may range from a mild disorder with few symptoms to a severe, debilitating disorder. The age of onset of fractures also varies from case to case.  Osteogenesis Type I  Osteogenesis type I is the most common and usually the mildest form of OI. In most cases, it is characterized by multiple bone fractures usually occurring during childhood through puberty. Fractures usually begin when an affected child begins to walk; fractures during the newborn (neonatal) period are rare. The frequency of fractures usually declines after puberty. Repeated fractures may result in slight malformation of the bones of the arms and legs (e.g., bowing of the tibia and femur).  A distinguishing feature associated with OI type I is bluish discoloration of the whites of the eyes (blue sclera). In some cases, individuals with OI type I may develop abnormalities affecting the middle and/or inner ears contributing to, or resulting in, hearing impairment (i.e., conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss). Hearing loss occurs most often in the third decade of life; however, it can occur as early as the second decade or as late as the seventh.  Individuals with OI type I may have a triangular facial appearance and an abnormally large head (macrocephaly).  In approximately 50 percent of cases, individuals with OI type I will experience growth deficiencies after birth (postnatal), resulting in mild short stature (e.g., affected individuals will be shorter than unaffected family members). Approximately 20 percent of adults with OI type I develop abnormal sideways or front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis).  Additional symptoms associated with OI type I include loose (hyperextensible) joints, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and thin skin that bruises easily.  Some researchers believe that a subgroup of OI type I exists in which affected individuals experience dental abnormalities in addition to the abovementioned features.  Osteogenesis Type II  OI type II is the most severe type of osteogenesis imperfecta. Affected infants often experience life-threatening complications at, or shortly after, birth. Infants with OI type II have low birth weight, abnormally short arms and legs (limbs), and bluish discoloration of the whites of the eyes (blue sclera). In addition, affected infants may have extremely fragile bones and numerous fractures present at birth. The ribs and long bones of the legs of affected infants are often malformed.  Infants with OI type II often have underdeveloped lungs and an abnormally small upper chest (thorax) that may result in life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. In some cases, affected infants may experience congestive heart failure.  Infants with OI type II may also have a small, narrow nose; a small jaw (micrognathia); and an abnormally soft top of the skull (calvaria) with abnormally large soft spots (large fonatanelle). Affected infants may also have abnormally thin, fragile skin and low muscle tone (hypotonia).  OI type II has been subdivided into three subgroups (A, B, and C) based upon small differences in bone formation seen only on x-rays (radiographic features).  Osteogenesis Type III  OI type III is characterized by extremely fragile bones, multiple fractures, and malformed bones. Multiple fractures are often present at birth. Fractures and malformation of various bones (most often the ribs and long bones) may become worse (progressive malformation) as affected infants and children age.  Progressive malformation of various bones may result in short stature, sideways and front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis), and malformation of the area where the bone in the back of the skull (occipital bone) and the top of the spine meet (basilar impression). In some cases, affected individuals may develop pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory problems. In severe cases, progressive bone malformation may result in affected individuals requiring wheelchairs.  Infants with OI type III may have a slight blue discoloration to the whites of the eyes (blue sclera) at birth. In most cases, the bluish tinge fades during the first year of life. Affected infants may have a triangular facial appearance due to an abnormally prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia). In some cases, hearing impairment and brittle, discolored teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta) may also be present.  Osteogenesis Type IV  Individuals with OI type IV have fragile bones that often fracture easily. Fractures are more common before puberty. Affected individuals experience mild to moderate bone malformation and are usually shorter than average. Affected individuals may develop sideways and front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis).  Individuals with OI type IV may have a triangular facial appearance. In most cases, the whites of the eyes (sclera) are normal or pale blue during infancy. As an affected infant ages, the pale blue discoloration of the sclera fades. Affected individuals may also experience hearing impairment and brittle, discolored teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta)  Unclassified Osteogenesis Imperfecta  Many cases of individuals with the bone abnormalities characteristic of osteogenesis imperfecta have been reported in the medical literature. However, these cases have additional symptoms that prevent them from being classified under one of the four main types of OI. Researchers have speculated that these cases may be subgroups of one of the four main types of OI, an additional type of OI (e.g., OI type V), or separate disorders. (For more information on these disorders, see the Related Disorders section below.)      Causes  In most cases, osteogenesis imperfecta types I, II, and IV are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Most cases of OI type II occur without a previous family history of the disorder, resulting instead from a spontaneous genetic change (i.e., new mutation). The inheritance of this mutation is autosomal dominant.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed “dominating” the other normal gene and resulting in the appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.  The risk is the same for each pregnancy.  Rare subgroups of OI types II and III may be inherited as autosomal recessive genetic traits. In recessive disorders, the condition does not occur unless an individual inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy.  Investigators have determined that most types of osteogenesis imperfecta are caused by disruption or changes (mutations) of one of two genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2). These genes carry instructions for the production of type 1 collagen. Collagen is the major protein of bone and connective tissue including the skin, tendons, and sclera.  The COL1A1 gene is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 17 (17q21.31-q22). Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of all body cells. They carry the genetic characteristics of each individual. Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22, with an unequal 23rd pair of X and Y chromosomes for males and two X chromosomes for females. Each chromosome has a short arm designated as “p” and a long arm identified by the letter “q.” Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered. For example, “chromosome 17q21.31-q22” refers to bands 21.31-22 on the long arm of chromosome 17.  The COL1A2 gene is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 7 (7q22.1).  In 2006, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) discovered that a previously unexplained fatal form of osteogenesis imperfecta results from a genetic defect in a different gene known as CRTAP.  The CRTAP gene codes for (contains the information for) cartilage-associated protein.  These mutations are associated with a recessive form of the disorder.  The discovery of this gene was described in an article published in the December 28, 2006, New England Journal of Medicine.      Affected Populations  Osteogenesis imperfecta affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of individuals with OI in the United States (prevalence) is unknown. OI type I is estimated to occur in one in 30,000 live births. OI type II is estimated to occur in one in 60,000 live births. The overall prevalence of all types of OI is estimated at .5 per 10,000 individuals in the United States. Approximately 20,000 to 50,000 individuals in the United States have OI.      Related Disorders  Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of osteogenesis imperfecta.  Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis:  Achondroplasia is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short arms and legs and short stature (short-limbed dwarfism), abnormal facial features, and/or skeletal malformations. Characteristic facial features may include an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), unusual prominence of the forehead (frontal bossing), a low nasal bridge, and/or underdevelopment of the middle portion of the face (midface hypoplasia). Skeletal malformations may include unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), abnormally increased backward curvature of the spine (lordosis), legs that bow outward (genu varum), and/or narrowing (stenosis) of the spine. Additional abnormalities may include limited extension of the elbows and hips, diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), and/or frequent infections of the middle ear (otitis media). In most cases, achondroplasia appears to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadic). (For more information on this disorder, choose “Achondroplasia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Hypophosphatasia is a rare disorder characterized by defective bone hardening (mineralization) resulting in weakened bones. The long bones of the arms and legs may be abnormally thick, short and bowed. Affected infants may also have an abnormally small head (microcepahly). Many adults with hypophosphatasia have short stature. Hypophosphatasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Hypophosphatasia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Pyknodysostosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased density of bones (osteosclerosis), short stature, an underdeveloped lower jaw (mandible), and dental abnormalities. Affected individuals often have fragile bones and may be prone to stress fractures. Pyknodysostosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Pyknodysostosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Osteopetrosis is a rare disorder marked by increased bone density, brittle bones, and, in some cases, skeletal abnormalities. Although symptoms may not initially be apparent in people with mild forms of this disorder, trivial injuries may cause bone fractures, due to abnormalities of the bone. The adult type of osteopetrosis is milder than the malignant infantile and intermediate types of osteopetrosis, and may not be diagnosed until adolescence or adulthood when symptoms first appear. More serious complications occur in the malignant infantile and intermediate types of osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis may be inherited as an autosomal recessive or dominant trait. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Osteopetrosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)  Osteogenesis imperfecta syndromes is the term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by bone abnormalities (e.g., fragile bones and multiple fractures) similar to those found in the main four types of OI. However, these disorders have associated features that differentiate them from the main four types of OI. These so-called osteogenesis imperfecta syndromes are extremely rare with only a few cases for each syndrome described in the medical literature. Cole-Carpenter syndrome described below is an osteogenesis imperfecta syndrome.  Cole-Carpenter syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by extremely fragile bones and multiple fractures like those seen in OI. In addition, affected infants may experience bluish discoloration of the whites of the eyes (blue sclera), premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), an abnormally prominent forehead (frontal bossing), an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), and abnormal protrusion of the eye (proptosis). Affected infants may also experience growth failure. Approximately five cases of this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. Cole-Carpenter syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.      Diagnosis  A diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of specialized tests. Surgical removal and microscopic examination (biopsy) of the skin may be done to determine whether abnormalities of collagen are present. A blood sample may be taken and tested to detect the presence of the genetic mutation that causes OI.  In some cases, the diagnosis of OI may be made before birth (prenatally), based upon specialized tests such as ultrasound, amniocentesis, and/or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Ultrasound studies may reveal characteristic findings such as fractures or bowing of the long bones. During amniocentesis, a sample of fluid that surrounds the developing fetus is removed and studied. During chorionic villus sampling, a tissue sample is removed from a portion of the placenta. Chromosomal studies performed on this fluid or tissue sample may reveal the genetic mutation that causes OI.      Standard Therapies  Treatment  The treatment of OI is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms, maintaining individual mobility, and strengthening bone and muscle.  Exercise and physical therapy programs have proven beneficial in strengthening muscles, increasing weight-bearing capacity, and reducing the tendency to fracture. Physical therapy in the water (hydrotherapy) has also been proven helpful since moving around in water lessens the chance of fracture. Individuals with OI should consult with their physicians and physical therapists to determine a safe and appropriate exercise program.  A procedure in which metal rods are surgically placed in the long bones to prevent fractures (rodding) is often used to treat individuals with OI. Plastic braces are replacing plaster casts as protective devices because they permit greater freedom of movement and can be used in water. Inflatable suits can provide added protection, especially to very young children.  Surgery may prove necessary for individuals with severe malformation of the bones of the spine or basilar impression. Dental procedures may be necessary to correct various dental abnormalities. Affected individuals, especially adults, should be monitored for hearing impairment often associated with OI. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for affected individuals and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.      Investigational Therapies  Information on current clinical trials is posted on the Internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov.  All studies receiving U.S. government funding, and some supported by private industry, are posted on this government web site.

As of January 2007, there were seven clinical trials listed on www.clinicaltrials.gov investigating various treatment strategies for osteogenesis imperfecta.  Among them, researchers were studying new treatment options for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, including bisphosphonate drugs, growth hormones, and bone marrow transplants.  One of these drugs is Fosomax, which earned an FDA orphan drug designation in 2004.  Another drug study is a phase IV trial involving the drug Teriparatide for the treatment of adults with this disorder.  Growth hormone (GH) therapy has proven beneficial in individuals with mild or moderate forms of OI. GH has helped improve collagen production and increased growth and bone mineral density. More research is necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of this treatment for individuals with OI.  Initial studies of the bisphosphonate drug, Pamidronate, have shown an increase in bone mineral density and a reduction in the frequency of fractures in individuals with severe forms of OI. More research is necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of OI.  Marrow mesenchymal cell therapy is currently (2006) being investigated in a clinical study that began in 2004. This involves a bone marrow transplant procedure.

NHGRI Research on Osteogenesis imperfecta  Additional Resources on Osteogenesis imperfecta   What is Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes a person's bones to break easily, often from little or no apparent trauma. OI is also called "brittle bone disease." OI varies in severity from person to person, ranging from a mild type to a severe type that causes death before or shortly after birth. In addition to having fractures, people with OI also have teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), and hearing loss when they are adults. People who have OI may also have muscle weakness, loose joints (joint laxity) and skeletal malformations.  OI occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals, including people diagnosed after birth. OI occurs with equal frequency among males and females and among racial and ethnic groups. Life expectancy varies depending on how severe the OI is, ranging from very brief (lethal form, OI type II) to average.  There are four well-known types of OI. These types are distinguished mostly by fracture frequency and severity and by characteristic features. Three additional types of OI (type V, VI and VII) have also been identified.  The vast majority (90 percent) of OI is caused by a single dominant mutation in one of two type I collagen genes: COL1A1 or COL1A2 .The COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to create a larger molecule called type I collagen. This type of collagen is the most common protein in bone, skin and other tissues that provide structure and strength to the body (connective tissues). OI type VII is caused by recessive mutations in the CRTAP gene.  Top of page  What are the symptoms of Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) causes bones to be fragile and easily broken and is also responsible for other health problems.  Type I OI is the mildest form of the condition. People who have type I OI have bone fractures during childhood and adolescence often due to minor trauma When these individuals reach adulthood they have fewer fractures.  Type II OI is the most severe form of OI. Infants with type II have bones that appear bent or crumpled and fractured before birth. Their chest is narrow and they have fractured and misshapen ribs and underdeveloped lungs. These infants have short, bowed arms and legs; hips that turn outward; and unusually soft skull bones. Most infants with type II OI are stillborn or die shortly after birth, usually from breathing failure.  Type III OI also has relatively severe signs and symptoms. Infants with OI type III have very soft and fragile bones that may begin to fracture before birth or in early infancy. Some infants have rib fractures that can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. Bone abnormalities tend to get worse over time and often interfere with the ability to walk.  Type IV OI is the most variable form OI. Symptoms of OI type IV can range from mild to severe. About 25 percent of infants with OI type IV are born with bone fractures. Others may not have broken bones until later in childhood or adulthood. Infants with OI type IV have leg bones that are bowed at birth, but bowing usually lessens as they get older.  Some types of OI are also associated with progressive hearing loss, a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and loose joints. People with this condition may have other bone abnormalities and are often shorter in stature than average.  Top of page  How is Osteogenesis imperfecta diagnosed?  OI is often inherited from an affected parent. The diagnosis of OI is made on the basis of family history and/or clinical presentation. Frequent fractures, short stature, a blue hue to the white part of the eye (blue sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta) and hearing loss that progresses after puberty may be present.  X-rays are also used to diagnose OI. X-ray findings include fractures that are at different stages of healing; an unexpected skull bone pattern called Wormian bones; and bones in the spine called "codfish vertebrae."  Laboratory testing for OI may include either biochemical testing or DNA-based sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 . Biochemical testing involves studying collagens taken from a small skin biopsy. Changes in type I collagen are an indication of OI.  DNA sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 is used to identify the type I collagen gene mutation responsible for the altered collagen protein. DNA testing requires a blood sample for DNA extraction. Both tests are relatively sensitive, detecting approximately 90 percent and 95 percent, respectively, of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of OI. Normal biochemical and molecular testing in a child with OI warrants additional testing of less common collagen genes ( CRTAP and P3H (LEPRE1) ) responsible for some of the rare recessive forms of OI.  Top of page  What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  There is currently no cure for OI. Treatment involves supportive therapy to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities, help with independent living and maintain overall health. OI is best managed by a medical team including the child's own doctor, and genetic, orthopedic and rehabilitation medicine. Supportive therapy is unique to each individual depending on the severity of their condition and their age.  Physical and occupational therapies to help improve their ability to move, to prevent fractures and to increase muscle strength are often useful.  Fractures are treated as they would be in children and adults who do not have OI. An orthopedic treatment called intramedullary rodding (placing rods in the bones) is used to help with positioning of legs that helps with more normal functioning when necessary.  A newer treatment with medication called biophosphonates is being used to help with bone formation and to decrease the need for surgery.  Top of page  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  Most types of OI are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Almost all infants with the severe type II OI are born into families without a family history of the condition. Usually, the cause in these families is a new mutation in the egg or sperm or very early embryo in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. In the milder forms of OI, 25-30 percent of cases occur as a result of new mutations. The other cases are inherited from a parent who has the condition. Whether a person has OI due to a new mutation or an inherited genetic change, an adult with the disorder can pass the condition down to future generations.  In autosomal dominant inherited OI, a parent who has OI has one copy of a gene mutation that causes OI. With each of his/her pregnancies, there is a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the OI gene mutation to a child who would have OI, and a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the normal version of the gene to a child who would not have OI.  Rarely, OI can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. The autosomal recessive form of type III OI usually results from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .

Fall 2006.  Can people who have OI have children? Yes. Many men and women who have OI are parents. All young people who have OI need to receive information about reproductive health, sexuality and the genetics of OI. There is some research that indicates that couples with any genetic disorder may have a lower success rate for becoming pregnant, but OI does not prevent having children. Many people with OI conceive children naturally. Sometimes their children have OI. (See “What are the odds of passing OI on to your children?” below.) Adults with OI who chose to become parents report that they don’t regret their choice, but acknowledge sometimes feeling grief or sadness when their child with OI is in pain.  Can women who have OI use birth control pills? In most cases, the answer is yes. Women of short stature should consult with their doctor about whether a low dose pill would be more appropriate for them and whether the birth control pill they wish to use is associated with bone density loss.  Should adults considering parenthood seek genetic counseling? Many couples seek genetic counseling before they become pregnant. This can be a good way to get answers to personal questions about OI and genetics. Knowing the parent’s OI mutation is helpful in planning for delivery and for determining if the child has OI. Certain methods of prenatal diagnosis of OI are only possible if the affected parent’s mutation is known. If the parent with OI has never had a collagen biopsy or DNA analysis to identify the mutation, it is important to start the process either early in the pregnancy or before conception, since it takes many months to get test results.   What are the odds of passing OI on to your children? When one parent has OI there is a 50% chance with each pregnancy that the child will have OI. If both parents have OI there is a 75% chance that the child will have OI. Usually the child will have the same OI-causing mutation as the parent, although the child’s symptoms can be milder or more severe than the parent’s symptoms. No one knows for sure how or why this happens. It is possible that the child of a person with OI will have a spontaneous genetic mutation resulting in a different type of OI, but the chances of this happening are about 1 in 15,000. When a parent has a moderate or severe form of OI and no collagen mutation can be identified, then a test for one of the recessive forms of OI is needed. If a person with OI has a recessive form of OI, then his or her siblings have a 50% chance of being carriers of the recessive gene. When both parents are carriers of a recessive OI mutation, there is a 25% chance that their child will have OI. Excluding OI, the risk of other congenital disorders in pregnancies in which one parent has OI is the same as that of the general population.  Is it possible to change the odds? At this time, there are no treatments, or dietary supplements that can prevent the fetus from having OI or that will make the type of OI milder. There are several options for couples to consider including using a sperm or egg donor, a surrogate mother for the pregnancy, or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Detailed information about each option can be obtained from your primary care doctor, your gynecologist, a genetic counselor or from fertility clinic staff. PGD is a bio-technology that makes it possible to avoid passing on OI. It involves the standard in vitro fertilization process plus the added step of “embryo analysis.” After a couple goes through the initial stages for in vitro fertilization and embryos have been formed, a single cell is removed from the dividing cells at the 8 cell stage. It is tested for OI. If the embryo does not show any signs of OI, it is implanted in the mother to continue normal development. At this time there are no known negative effects on the fetus from having one cell removed at the 8 cell stage. The OI gene cannot be removed, but the process allows only embryos without the mutation to be implanted. Only one genetic condition can be tested for and the possibility exists that the embryo carries some other mutation. The success rate for in vitro fertilization averages 17-40% depending on the number of embryos implanted, the age of the parents, and other medical factors. To be candidates for this process, the parent’s exact OI mutation must have been previously identified, usually through DNA analysis. Then a test for OI must be developed by the bio-engineers. Since OI is caused by many different mutations, a separate test must be developed for each family. The test in the PGD process looks for the exact same mutation in the gene sequence of the embryo cell. In general, the extra step of “embryo analysis” comes close to doubling the cost for in vitro fertilization. In some cases, insurance covers at least part of the cost of the PGD portion of the process and the in vitro fertilization parts of this process. It is important to determine what your insurance will cover at the beginning of the process. The PGD and in vitro fertilization process is physically rigorous for the woman, and can be stressful for both parents. It can require more than one treatment cycle.  Are there special concerns if the mother is the person with OI? All women with OI need expert medical care during pregnancy. Women who are considering a pregnancy should work with their doctor to ensure that they go into pregnancy in good health and that any OI-related health issues are addressed. Short stature, a history of pelvic or spine fracture, back pain and a history of respiratory problems are important areas for discussion. It takes women with OI longer to recover from the bone loss associated with any pregnancy. The obstetrician can also provide information about prenatal testing, such as ultrasound, and may order additional testing to help plan for delivery. Please see the OI Foundation fact sheet OI Issues: Pregnancy Considerations for Women with OI for a more detailed discussion.  What are the special considerations when the father has OI? When the father has OI, the obstetrician may suggest additional ultrasounds to see if the fetus shows any signs of having OI. For more information about prenatal testing and options for giving birth, please see the OI Foundation fact sheet OI Issues: Obstetric Considerations for Women without OI.  Do people who have OI qualify to be adoptive or foster parents? Yes. Many resources are available to help adults learn about adoption or becoming a foster parent. Some of these resources are listed below. The OI Foundation posts information about children with OI who are available for adoption on its web site www.oif.org under “Programs and Support.” For information about foster parenting, contact your local government’s department of social services or the organizations listed below.

A classification system of different types of OI is commonly used to help describe how severely a person with OI is affected. For example, a person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.  Prevalence While the number of people affected with OI in the United States is unknown, the best estimate suggests a minimum of 20,000 and possibly as many as 50,000.  Diagnosis OI is caused by genetic defects that affect the body’s ability to make strong bones. In dominant (classical) OI, a person has too little type I collagen or a poor quality of type I collagen due to a mutation in one of the type I collagen genes. Collagen is the major protein of the body’s connective tissue. It is part of the framework that bones are formed around. In recessive OI, mutations in other genes interfere with collagen production. The result in all cases is fragile bones that break easily.  It is often, though not always, possible to diagnose OI based solely on clinical features. Clinical geneticists can also perform biochemical (collagen) or molecular (DNA) tests that can help confirm a diagnosis of OI in some situations. These tests generally require several weeks before results are known. Both the collagen biopsy test and DNA test are thought to detect almost 90% of all type I collagen mutations.  A positive type I collagen study confirms the diagnosis of dominant OI, but a negative result could mean that either a collagen type I mutation is present but was not detected or the patient has a form of the disorder that is not associated with type 1 collagen mutations or the patient has a recessive form of OI. Therefore, a negative type I collagen study does not rule out OI. When a type I collagen mutation is not found, other DNA tests to check for recessive forms are available.  Clinical Features The characteristic features of OI vary greatly from person to person, even among people with the same type of OI, and even within the same family. Not all characteristics are evident in each case. The majority of cases of OI (possibly 85-90 %) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type I collagen (Types I, II, III, and IV in the following list). Types VII and VIII are newly identified forms that are inherited in a recessive manner. The genes causing these two types have been identified. Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen mutation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. The general features of each known type of OI are as follows:  Type I   Most common and mildest type of OI.  Bones fracture easily. Most fractures occur before puberty.  Normal or near-normal stature.  Loose joints and muscle weakness.  Sclera (whites of the eyes) usually have a blue, purple, or gray tint.  Triangular face.  Tendency toward spinal curvature.  Bone deformity absent or minimal.  Brittle teeth possible.  Hearing loss possible, often beginning in early 20s or 30s.  Collagen structure is normal, but the amount is less than normal.   Type II   Most severe form.  Frequently lethal at or shortly after birth, often due to respiratory problems.  Numerous fractures and severe bone deformity.  Small stature with underdeveloped lungs.  Tinted sclera.  Collagen improperly formed.   Type III   Bones fracture easily. Fractures often present at birth, and x-rays may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth.  Short stature.  Sclera have a blue, purple, or gray tint.  Loose joints and poor muscle development in arms and legs.  Barrel-shaped rib cage.  Triangular face.  Spinal curvature.  Respiratory problems possible.  Bone deformity, often severe.  Brittle teeth possible.  Hearing loss possible.  Collagen improperly formed.   Type IV   Between Type I and Type III in severity.  Bones fracture easily. Most fractures occur before puberty.  Shorter than average stature.  Sclera are white or near-white (i.e. normal in color).  Mild to moderate bone deformity.  Tendency toward spinal curvature.  Barrel-shaped rib cage.  Triangular face.  Brittle teeth possible.  Hearing loss possible.  Collagen improperly formed.   By studying the appearance of OI bone under the microscope, investigators noticed that some people who are clinically within the Type IV group had a distinct pattern to their bone. When they reviewed the full medical history of these people, they found that groups had other features in common. They named these groups Types V and VI OI. The mutations causing these forms of OI have not been identified, but people in these two groups do not have mutations in the type I collagen genes.  Type V   Clinically similar to Type IV in appearance and symptoms of OI.  A dense band seen on x-rays adjacent to the growth plate of the long bones.  Unusually large calluses (hypertrophic calluses) at the sites of fractures or surgical procedures. (A callus is an area of new bone that is laid down at the fracture site as part of the healing process.)  Calcification of the membrane between the radius and ulna (the bones of the forearm). This leads to restriction of forearm rotation.  White sclera.  Normal teeth.  Bone has a “mesh-like” appearance when viewed under the microscope.  Dominant inheritance pattern   Type VI   Clinically similar to Type IV in appearance and symptoms of OI.  The alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme linked to bone formation) activity level is slightly elevated in OI Type VI. This can be determined by a blood test.  Bone has a distinctive “fish-scale” appearance when viewed under the microscope.  Diagnosed by bone biopsy.  Whether this form is inherited in a dominant or recessive manner is unknown, but researchers believe the mode of inheritance is most likely recessive.  Eight people with this type of OI have been identified.   Recessive Forms of OI After years of research, two forms of OI that are inherited in a recessive manner were discovered in 2006. Both types are caused by genes that affect collagen formation. These forms provide information for people who have severe or moderately severe OI but who do not have a primary collagen mutation.  Type VII   The first described cases resemble Type IV OI in many aspects of appearance and symptoms.  In other instances the appearance and symptoms are similar to Type II lethal OI, except infants had white sclera, a small head and a round face.  Short stature.  Short humerus (arm bone) and short femur (upper leg bone)  Coxa vera is common (the acutely angled femur head affects the hip socket).  Results from recessive inheritance of a mutation to the CRTAP (cartilage-associated protein) gene. Partial function of CRTAP leads to moderate symptoms while total absence of CRTAP was lethal in all 4 identified cases.   Type VIII   Resembles lethal Type II or Type III OI in appearance and symptoms except that infants have white sclera.  Severe growth deficiency.  Extreme skeletal under mineralization.  Caused by a deficiency of P3H1 (Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1) due to a mutation to the LEPRE1 gene.   Inheritance Factors Most cases of OI (85-90%) are caused by a dominant genetic defect. This means that only one copy of the mutation carrying gene is necessary for the child to have OI. Children who have the dominant form of OI have either inherited it from a parent or, when the parent does not have OI, as a spontaneous mutation.  Approximately 10-15 percent of cases of OI are the result of a recessive mutation. In this situation, the parents do not have OI, but both carry the mutation in their genes. To inherit recessive OI the child must receive a copy of the mutation from both parents.  When a child has recessive OI, there is a 25 percent chance per pregnancy that the parents will have another child with OI. Siblings of a person with a recessive form of OI have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier of the recessive gene. DNA testing is available to help parents and siblings determine if they are carriers of this type of gene mutation.  A person with a form of OI caused by a dominant mutation has a 50 percent chance of passing on the disorder to each of his or her children. If one parent has OI because of a recessive mutation, 100 percent of their children will be carriers of the recessive OI mutation. Whether any of these children will have OI will depend on their inheritance from the other parent. Genetic counselors can help people with OI and their family members further understand OI genetics and the possibility of recurrence, and assist in prenatal diagnosis for those who wish to exercise that option. For more information on OI inheritance, see the OI Foundation fact sheet titled “Genetics.”  Treatment There is not yet a cure for OI. Treatment is directed toward preventing or controlling the symptoms, maximizing independent mobility, and developing optimal bone mass and muscle strength. Care of fractures, extensive surgical and dental procedures, and physical therapy are often recommended for people with OI. Use of wheelchairs, braces, and other mobility aids is common, particularly (although not exclusively) among people with more severe types of OI.  People with OI are encouraged to exercise as much as possible to promote muscle and bone strength, which can help prevent fractures. Swimming and water therapy are common exercise choices for people with OI, as water allows independent movement with little risk of fracture. For those who are able, walking (with or without mobility aids) is excellent exercise. People with OI should consult their physician and/or physical therapist to discuss appropriate and safe exercise.  Children and adults with OI will also benefit from maintaining a healthy weight, eating a nutritious diet, and avoiding activities such as smoking, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption, and taking steroid medications — all of which may deplete bone and make bones more fragile. For more information on nutrition, see the OI Foundation fact sheet titled “Nutrition.”  A surgical procedure called “rodding” is frequently considered for people with OI. This treatment involves inserting metal rods through the length of the long bones to strengthen them and prevent and/or correct deformities. For more information, see the OI Foundation’s fact sheet on “Rodding Surgery.”  Several medications and other treatments are being explored for their potential use to treat OI. These include growth hormone treatment, treatment with intravenous and oral drugs called bisphosphonates, an injected drug called teriparatide (for adults only) and gene therapies. It is not clear if people with recessive OI will respond in the same manner as people with dominant OI to these treatments. The OI Foundation provides current information on research studies, as well as information about participating in clinical trials.  Prognosis The prognosis for a person with OI varies greatly depending on the number and severity of symptoms. Respiratory failure is the most frequent cause of death for people with OI, followed by accidental trauma. Despite numerous fractures, restricted physical activity, and short stature, most adults and children with OI lead productive and successful lives. They attend school, develop friendships and other relationships, have careers, raise families, participate in sports and other recreational activities and are active members of their communities.

Description        Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The term " osteogenesis imperfecta " means imperfect bone formation. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth.  Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes.  Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta . The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma.  Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma.  Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta .  The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.            Enlarge          Frequency        This condition affects an estimated 6 to 7 per 100,000 people worldwide.  Types I and IV are the most common forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , affecting 4 to 5 per 100,000 people.      Related Information    What information about a genetic condition can statistics provide? Why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethnic groups?          Genetic Changes        Mutations in the COL1A1 , COL1A2 , CRTAP , and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type I collagen.  This type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body. Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily.  The mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  These mutations typically alter the structure of type I collagen molecules.  A defect in the structure of type I collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta . Mutations in the CRTAP and P3H1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta .  Cases caused by CRTAP mutations are usually classified as type VII; when P3H1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type VIII.  The proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. Mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. These defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth. In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. These cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types V and VI.  Researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.

How can gene mutations affect health and development? More about Mutations and Health          Inheritance Pattern        Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta  inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered.  The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene.  Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .  When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems ( dentinogenesis imperfecta ) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. [1] [2] There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. [3] Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and aims to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities.

OI is most commonly due to a variation (mutation) in either the collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which cause OI types I through IV.  The collagen genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific variation has on normal collagen production. [3] OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of the variations that cause OI type I occur in the COL1A1 gene.  In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to variations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. [3] [4] Variation in the CRTAP gene usually cause OI type VII; and variations in the LEPRE1  gene (also called P3H1 gene) are classified as type VIII.  Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen variation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. However, there are other genes in which variations may be responsible for these types or other less common types of OI, which have been reported in only one individual or family:   IFITM5 (type V)  SERPINF1 (type VI)  PPIB (type IX)  SERPINH1 (type X)  FKBP10 (type XI)  SP7 (type XII)  BMP1 (type XIII)  TMEM38B (type XIV)  WNT1 (type XV)  SPARC (type XVII)  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Inheritance   Inheritance        Listen          Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [5] [1] This means that having only one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene . [6] If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. [7]  OI subtypes  VII and VIII (and some cases of type III) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [5] This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. [7]  People concerned about inheritance risks for OI should talk with a genetic professional.  Last updated: 2/16/2018            Diagnosis   Diagnosis        Listen           Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. [8]  Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative. [8] GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for different types of osteogenesis imperfecta. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing, click here and click on "Testing" next to the type of OI in which you are interested. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or genetics professional. Genetics professionals, such as genetic counselors , can also explain the inheritance of OI in detail including information about genetic risks to specific family members.

A classification system of different types of OI is commonly used to help describe how severely a person with OI is affected. For example, a person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.  Prevalence  Diagnosis  Clinical Features  New Recessive Forms of OI  Inheritance Factors  Treatment  Prognosis  Resource  For Your Information  Prevalence  Although the number of people affected with OI in the United States is unknown, the best estimate suggests a minimum of 25,000 and possibly as many as 50,000.  Diagnosis  OI is caused by genetic defects that affect the body’s ability to make strong bones. Collagen is the major protein of the body’s connective tissue and can be likened to the framework around which a building is constructed. In dominant (classical) OI, a person has either too little type 1 collagen or a poor quality of type 1 collagen caused by a mutation in one of the type 1 collagen genes. In recessive OI, mutations in other genes interfere with collagen production. The result in all cases is weak bones that break easily.  It is often possible to diagnose OI based solely on clinical features. Clinical geneticists can perform biochemical (collagen) or molecular (DNA) tests that can help confirm a diagnosis of OI in some situations.  These tests generally require several weeks before results are known. Both the collagen biopsy test and the DNA test are thought to detect nearly 90 percent of all type 1 collagen mutations.  A positive collagen type I test confirms the diagnosis of dominant OI, but a negative result leaves open the possibility that:  A type 1 collagen mutation is present but was not detected.  The patient has a form of the disorder that is not associated with type 1 collagen mutations.  The patient has a recessive form of OI.  Therefore, a negative type 1 collagen study does not rule out OI. When a type 1 collagen mutation is not found, other DNA tests can check for recessive forms.  Clinical Features  The characteristic features of OI vary greatly from person to person, even among people with the same type of OI and even within the same family. Not all characteristics are evident in each case. The majority of OI cases (possibly 85 to 90 percent) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type 1 collagen (Types I, II, III, and IV in the following list). Types V and VI do not have a type 1 collagen mutation, but the genes causing them have not yet been identified. Types VII and VIII are newly discovered forms that are inherited in a recessive manner, and the genes causing these two types have been identified. The general features of each of the known types of OI, which vary in characteristics and severity, are as follows:  Type I OI  most common and mildest type of OI  bones predisposed to fracture (most fractures occur before puberty)  normal or near-normal stature  loose joints and muscle weakness  blue, purple, or gray tint to sclera (whites of the eyes)  triangular face  tendency toward spinal curvature  absent or minimal bone deformity  possible brittle teeth  possible hearing loss, often beginning in early twenties or thirties  normal collagen structure, but less than normal amount  Type II OI  most severe form of OI  frequently causes death at birth or shortly after, because of respiratory problems  numerous fractures and severe bone deformity  small stature with underdeveloped lungs  blue, purple, or gray tinted sclera  improperly formed collagen  Type III OI  most severe type among those who survive the neonatal period  easily fractured bones (Fractures often present at birth, and x-rays may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth.)  small stature  blue, purple, or gray tinted sclera  loose joints and poor muscle development in arms and legs  barrel-shaped rib cage  triangular face  spinal curvature  possible respiratory problems  often severe bone deformity  possible brittle teeth  possible hearing loss  improperly formed collagen  Type IV OI  between Type I and Type III OI in severity  bones easily fractured (most fractures occur before puberty)  smaller than average stature  sclera normal in color (i.e., white or near-white)  mild to moderate bone deformity  tendency toward spinal curvature  barrel-shaped rib cage  triangular face  possible brittle teeth  possible hearing loss  improperly formed collagen  By studying the appearance of OI bone under the microscope, investigators noticed that some people who are clinically within the Type IV group had a distinct pattern to their bone. When they reviewed the full medical history of these people, they found the groups had other features in common. They named these groups Type V and Type VI OI. The mutations causing these forms of OI have not been identified, but people in these two groups do not have mutations in the type 1 collagen genes.  Type V OI  clinically similar to Type IV OI in appearance and symptoms  a dense band seen on x-rays adjacent to the growth plate of the long bones  unusually large calluses, called hypertrophic calluses, at the sites of fractures or surgical procedures (A callus is an area of new bone that is laid down at the fracture site as part of the healing process.)  calcification of the membrane between the radius and ulna (the bones of the forearm), which leads to restriction of forearm rotation  sclera normal in color (i.e., white or near-white)  normal teeth “mesh-like” appearance to bone when viewed under the microscope  dominant inheritance pattern  Type VI OI  clinically similar to Type IV OI in appearance and symptoms, but is extremely rare  slightly elevated activity level of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme linked to bone formation), which can be determined by a blood test  distinctive “fish-scale” appearance to bone when viewed under the microscope  diagnosed by bone biopsy  unknown whether this form is inherited in a dominant or recessive manner, but researchers believe the mode of inheritance is most likely recessive  New Recessive Forms of OI  After years of research, in 2006, scientists discovered two forms of OI that are inherited in a recessive manner. Genes that affect collagen formation cause both types. The discovery of these new forms of OI provides information for people who have severe or moderately severe OI but do not have a primary collagen mutation.  Type VII OI  resembles Type IV OI in many aspects of appearance and symptoms in the first described cases  in other instances, similar appearance and symptoms to Type II lethal OI, except infants had white sclera, a small head, and a round face  small stature  short humerus (arm bone) and short femur (upper leg bone)  coxa vara (a deformed hip joint in which the neck of the femur is bent downward) is common; the acutely angled femur head affects the hip socket  results from recessive inheritance of a mutation in the CRTAP gene. Partial (10 percent) expression of CRTAP leads to moderate bone dysplasia. Total absence of the cartilage-associated protein has been lethal in all identified cases  Type VIII OI  resembles lethal Type II or Type III OI in appearance and symptoms, except infants have white sclera  severe growth deficiency  extreme skeletal undermineralization  caused by absence or severe deficiency of prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity due to mutations in the LEPRE1 gene  Inheritance Factors  Most cases of OI (85 to 90 percent) are caused by a dominant genetic defect. This means that only one copy of the mutation-carrying gene is necessary for the child to have OI. A person with a form of OI caused by a dominant mutation has a 50 percent chance of passing on the disorder to each of his or her children.  Some children who have the dominant form of OI inherit the disorder from a parent. Other children are born with the dominant form of OI even though there is no family history of the disorder. In these children, the genetic defect occurred as a spontaneous mutation.  Approximately 10 to 15 percent of OI cases are the result of a recessive mutation. In this situation, the parents do not have OI, but both carry the mutation in their genes. To inherit recessive OI, the child must receive a copy of the mutation from both parents.  The parents of a child with recessive OI have a 25-percent chance per pregnancy of having another child with OI. Siblings of a person with recessive OI have a 50-percent chance of being a carrier of the recessive gene. DNA testing is available to help parents and siblings determine if they are carriers of this type of gene mutation.  If one parent has OI because of a recessive mutation, 100 percent of their children will be carriers of the recessive OI mutation. Whether any of these children will have OI will depend on the genes inherited from the other parent. Genetic counselors can help people with OI and their family members understand OI genetics and the possibility of recurrence, and they can assist in prenatal diagnosis for those who wish to exercise that option. For more information on OI inheritance, see the fact sheet, Genetics , from the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation.  Treatment  There is not yet a cure for OI. Treatment is directed toward preventing or controlling the symptoms, maximizing independent mobility, and developing optimal bone mass and muscle strength. Care of fractures, extensive surgical and dental procedures, and physical therapy are often recommended for people with OI. Use of wheelchairs, braces, and other mobility aids is common, particularly (although not exclusively) among people with more severe types of OI.  Doctors frequently consider a surgical procedure called “rodding” for people with OI. This treatment involves inserting metal rods through the length of the long bones to strengthen them. The treatment also prevents or corrects deformities. For more information, see the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation’s fact sheet, Rodding Surgery .  Scientists are exploring several medications and other treatments for their potential use to treat OI. These include growth hormone treatment, intravenous and oral drugs called bisphosphonates, an injected drug called teriparatide (for adults only), and gene therapies. It is not clear whether people with recessive OI and those with dominant OI will respond to these treatments in the same manner. The OI Foundation can provide current information on research studies and experimental treatments to help individuals with OI decide whether to participate in clinical trials.  People with OI are encouraged to exercise as much as possible to promote muscle and bone strength, which can help prevent fractures. Swimming and water therapy are common exercise choices for people with OI, as water allows independent movement with little risk of fracture. For those who are able, walking (with or without mobility aids) is excellent exercise. People with OI should consult their doctor or physical therapist to discuss appropriate and safe exercise.  Children and adults with OI also will benefit from maintaining a healthy weight, eating a nutritious diet, and avoiding activities such as smoking, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption, and taking steroid medications—all of which may deplete bone and exacerbate bone fragility. For more information on nutrition, see the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation’s fact sheet, Nutrition .  Prognosis  The prognosis for a person with OI varies greatly depending on the number and severity of symptoms. Respiratory failure is the most frequent cause of death for people with OI, followed by accidental trauma. Despite numerous fractures, restricted activity, and small stature, most adults and children with OI lead productive and successful lives. They attend school, develop friendships and other relationships, have careers, raise families, participate in sports and other recreational activities, and are active members of their communities.

What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  NHGRI Research on Osteogenesis imperfecta  Additional Resources on Osteogenesis imperfecta   What is Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes a person's bones to break easily, often from little or no apparent trauma. OI is also called "brittle bone disease." OI varies in severity from person to person, ranging from a mild type to a severe type that causes death before or shortly after birth. In addition to having fractures, people with OI also have teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), and hearing loss when they are adults. People who have OI may also have muscle weakness, loose joints (joint laxity) and skeletal malformations.  OI occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals, including people diagnosed after birth. OI occurs with equal frequency among males and females and among racial and ethnic groups. Life expectancy varies depending on how severe the OI is, ranging from very brief (lethal form, OI type II) to average.  There are four well-known types of OI. These types are distinguished mostly by fracture frequency and severity and by characteristic features. Three additional types of OI (type V, VI and VII) have also been identified.  The vast majority (90 percent) of OI is caused by a single dominant mutation in one of two type I collagen genes: COL1A1 or COL1A2 .The COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to create a larger molecule called type I collagen. This type of collagen is the most common protein in bone, skin and other tissues that provide structure and strength to the body (connective tissues). OI type VII is caused by recessive mutations in the CRTAP gene.  Top of page  What are the symptoms of Osteogenesis imperfecta?  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) causes bones to be fragile and easily broken and is also responsible for other health problems.  Type I OI is the mildest form of the condition. People who have type I OI have bone fractures during childhood and adolescence often due to minor trauma When these individuals reach adulthood they have fewer fractures.  Type II OI is the most severe form of OI. Infants with type II have bones that appear bent or crumpled and fractured before birth. Their chest is narrow and they have fractured and misshapen ribs and underdeveloped lungs. These infants have short, bowed arms and legs; hips that turn outward; and unusually soft skull bones. Most infants with type II OI are stillborn or die shortly after birth, usually from breathing failure.  Type III OI also has relatively severe signs and symptoms. Infants with OI type III have very soft and fragile bones that may begin to fracture before birth or in early infancy. Some infants have rib fractures that can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. Bone abnormalities tend to get worse over time and often interfere with the ability to walk.  Type IV OI is the most variable form OI. Symptoms of OI type IV can range from mild to severe. About 25 percent of infants with OI type IV are born with bone fractures. Others may not have broken bones until later in childhood or adulthood. Infants with OI type IV have leg bones that are bowed at birth, but bowing usually lessens as they get older.  Some types of OI are also associated with progressive hearing loss, a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta), abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and loose joints. People with this condition may have other bone abnormalities and are often shorter in stature than average.  Top of page  How is Osteogenesis imperfecta diagnosed?  OI is often inherited from an affected parent. The diagnosis of OI is made on the basis of family history and/or clinical presentation. Frequent fractures, short stature, a blue hue to the white part of the eye (blue sclera), teeth problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta) and hearing loss that progresses after puberty may be present.  X-rays are also used to diagnose OI. X-ray findings include fractures that are at different stages of healing; an unexpected skull bone pattern called Wormian bones; and bones in the spine called "codfish vertebrae."  Laboratory testing for OI may include either biochemical testing or DNA-based sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 . Biochemical testing involves studying collagens taken from a small skin biopsy. Changes in type I collagen are an indication of OI.  DNA sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 is used to identify the type I collagen gene mutation responsible for the altered collagen protein. DNA testing requires a blood sample for DNA extraction. Both tests are relatively sensitive, detecting approximately 90 percent and 95 percent, respectively, of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of OI. Normal biochemical and molecular testing in a child with OI warrants additional testing of less common collagen genes ( CRTAP and P3H (LEPRE1) ) responsible for some of the rare recessive forms of OI.  Top of page  What is the treatment for Osteogenesis imperfecta?  There is currently no cure for OI. Treatment involves supportive therapy to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities, help with independent living and maintain overall health. OI is best managed by a medical team including the child's own doctor, and genetic, orthopedic and rehabilitation medicine. Supportive therapy is unique to each individual depending on the severity of their condition and their age.  Physical and occupational therapies to help improve their ability to move, to prevent fractures and to increase muscle strength are often useful.  Fractures are treated as they would be in children and adults who do not have OI. An orthopedic treatment called intramedullary rodding (placing rods in the bones) is used to help with positioning of legs that helps with more normal functioning when necessary.  A newer treatment with medication called biophosphonates is being used to help with bone formation and to decrease the need for surgery.  Top of page  Is Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited?  Most types of OI are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Almost all infants with the severe type II OI are born into families without a family history of the condition. Usually, the cause in these families is a new mutation in the egg or sperm or very early embryo in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. In the milder forms of OI, 25-30 percent of cases occur as a result of new mutations. The other cases are inherited from a parent who has the condition. Whether a person has OI due to a new mutation or an inherited genetic change, an adult with the disorder can pass the condition down to future generations.  In autosomal dominant inherited OI, a parent who has OI has one copy of a gene mutation that causes OI. With each of his/her pregnancies, there is a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the OI gene mutation to a child who would have OI, and a 1 in 2 (50 percent) chance to pass on the normal version of the gene to a child who would not have OI.  Rarely, OI can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. The autosomal recessive form of type III OI usually results from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2 .

Other times, the IO is not inherited, but is caused by a mutation. In this case, neither parent shows no sign of OI. The mutation is again dominant inheritance.  And a particularly complicated is the possibility of mosaicism. Because of all this complexity, it is recommended to seek genetic counseling staff.  The Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a disease of genetic type, and therefore is hereditary. Types I and IV sometimes appear in families over several generations. The kind of inheritance is dominant: a parent or medre affected has a 50% chance of transmitting the altered gene to each child, and another 50% to transmit the gene-altered (all of us have two copies of each gene, except for the genes linked to the chromosomes that carry the legacy sex).  Although there is some degree of variation between affected family members (eg number of fractures), the clinical classification of the disease in each affected family is generally the same throughout the generations, as it is the same genetic defect that passed on from father to son.  Moreover, the O.I. Is a very heterogeneous among cases without family relationship: the individual case may be a genetic defect in different genes that carry the information of collagen.  The RO, like other dominant genetic diseases may occur spontaneously. This is particularly true in types II and III, which are typically more severe forms of OI, but it may occur in other cases. When a child is born / a parent is not affected because it usually has appeared a mutation in a gene of collagen. Mutations are sporadic and unpredictable changes in the genetic information carried by DNA. It is most likely that the mutation occurred in one of the two gametes (egg or sperm), whose union leads the child to affected / a.  In those families in which appears a case of spontaneous OI The siblings unaffected citizens are not carriers of the mutation, therefore, the children of those do not have a particular genetic risk of having the disease, by contrast, a child affected is a student with a probability of 50% convey the mutant gene, and thus the disease to their own children, starting a new chain of genetic inheritance, with 50% probability, over new generations.  With regard to the parents, studies in a large number of families with children born with OI type II (lethal) parents not affected, it has shown a certain recurrence of the disease (ie, new children with OI) , in a 5 to 7% of cases.  This strange situation was explained wrongly long with a different type of genetic inheritance (autosomal recessive), and even today can lead to confusion (and therefore, a genetic counseling wrong) to physicians who are not fully up to date in terms to new research on the IO Peter Byers and his colleagues at the University of Seattle, USA, and subsequently many other researchers have shown that the recurrence of cases of OI Families with no previous cases of this disease is caused by mutations in one of the dominant genes of collagen (COL1A1 and COL1A2): spontaneous mutation, rather than affect a single cigoto (egg or sperm), has affected a certain portion of them in the parent, who, therefore, has a certain probability of breed more than one child affected by the disease.  This phenomenon is called mosaicism.  It is very difficult to diagnose cases of mosaicism: find the mutation in their cells could be worse than find the needle in the haystack. Only after the mutation has been identified in the child / concerned / a, which the carrier in all its cells, it is possible to design molecular analysis to try to seek mosaicism in parents (usually in ova and / or sperm, and also in the white blood cells), and then, try to estimate the theoretical probability of repeat child with OI.  The mosaicism may occur in any type of OI, but so far has only been documented for more severe types of the disease (type II), and their frequency has been experimentally estimated between 5 and 7%.

      bones are formed improperly, making them fragile and prone to breaking.    Description          Collagen is a fibrous protein material that serves as the structural
      foundation of skin, bone, cartilage, and ligaments. In osteogenesis
      imperfecta, the collagen produced is abnormal and disorganized, which
      results in a number of abnormalities throughout the body, the most notable
      being fragile, easily broken bones.  There are four forms of OI, types I through IV. Of these, type II is the
      most severe and is usually fatal within a short time after birth. Types I,
      III, and IV have some overlapping and some distinctive symptoms, with the
      hallmark symptom being fragile bones.  OI is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. In autosomal
      dominant inheritance, a single abnormal gene on one of the autosomal
      chromosomes (one of the first 22 non-sex chromosomes) from either parent
      can cause the disease. Only one parent needs to be a carrier in order for
      the child to inherit the disease. The parent affected by OI will have one
      abnormal gene and one normal gene. A child who has one parent with the
      disease therefore has a 50 percent chance of also inheriting the disease.  If both parents have OI caused by an autosomal dominant gene change, there
      is a 75 percent chance that the child will inherit one or both OI genes.
      In other words, there is a 25 percent chance of inheriting a faulty gene
      from the mother and a normal gene from the father, a 25 percent chance of
      inheriting a normal gene from the mother and a faulty gene from the
      father, a 25 percent chance of inheriting faulty genes from both parents,
      and a 25 percent chance of inheriting normal genes from both parents. It
      is difficult to predict the severity of OI in a child who has inherited
      two copies of the faulty gene because of its rarity.  There is no  family  history of OI in about 25 percent of children born with the disease. This
      occurs as a result of a spontaneous mutation of the gene in either the
      sperm or egg. The cause of such mutations is not known. Called new
      dominant mutation, the affected child subsequently has a 50 percent of
      passing the abnormal gene to his or her children. The risk of normal
      parents having a second child with OI, or of normal siblings going on to
      have affected children, does not appear to be greater than that of the
      general population.  In studies of families into which infants with OI type II were born, most
      of the babies had a new dominant mutation in a collagen gene. In some of
      these families, however, more than one infant was born with OI.
      Previously, researchers had seen this recurrence as evidence of recessive
      inheritance of OI type II. Subsequently, however, researchers concluded
      that the rare recurrence 
       of OI to a couple with a child with autosomal dominant OI is more likely
      due to gonadal mosaicism. Instead of mutation occurring in an individual
      sperm or egg, it occurs in a percentage of the cells that give rise to a
      parent's multiple sperm or eggs. This mutation, present in a
      percentage of his or her reproductive cells, can result in more than one
      affected child without affecting the parent with the disorder. An
      estimated 2 percent to 4 percent of families into which an infant with OI
      type II is born are at risk of having another affected child because of
      gonadal mosaicism.    Demographics  OI affects equal numbers of males and females. It occurs in about one of
      every 20,000 births.    Causes and symptoms  Evidence suggests that OI results from abnormalities in the collagen gene
      COL1A1 or COL1A2 and possibly abnormalities in other genes. In OI, the
      genetic abnormality causes one of two things to occur. It may direct cells
      to make an altered collagen protein and the presence of this altered
      collagen causes OI type II, III, or IV. Alternately, the dominant altered
      gene may fail to direct cells to make any collagen protein. Although some
      collagen is produced by instructions from the normal gene, an overall
      decrease in the total amount of collagen produced results in OI type I.    Type I  OI type I is the most common and mildest type. Among the common features
      of type I are the following:   Bones are predisposed to fracture, with most  fractures  occurring before  puberty  ; people with OI type I typically have about 20 to 40 fractures before
        puberty.  Stature is normal or near-normal.  Joints are loose and muscle tone is low.  Sclerae (whites of the eyes) have blue, purple, or gray tint.  Face shape is triangular.  Tendency toward  scoliosis  (a curvature of the spine) is present.  Bone deformity is absent or minimal.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur, causing brittle teeth.  Hearing loss is a possible symptom, often beginning in early 20s or 30s.  Structure of collagen is normal but the amount is lower than normal.     Type II  Sometimes called the lethal form, type II is the most severe form of OI.
      Among the common features of type II are the following:   Frequently, OI type II is lethal at or shortly after birth, often as a
        result of respiratory problems.  Fractures are numerous and bone deformity is severe.  Stature is small with underdeveloped lungs.  Collagen is formed improperly.     Type III  Among the common features of type III are the following:   Bones fracture easily (Fractures are often present at birth, and x rays
        may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth; people with OI
        type III may have more than 100 fractures before puberty.)  Stature is significantly shorter than normal.  Sclerae have blue, purple, or gray tint.  Joints are loose and muscle development is poor in arms and legs.  Rib cage is barrel-shaped.  Face shape is triangular.  Scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) is present.  Respiratory problems are possible.  Bones are deformed and deformity is often severe.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur.  Hearing loss is possible.  Collagen is formed improperly.     Type IV  OI type IV falls between type I and type III in severity. Among the common
      features of type IV are the following:   Bones fracture easily, with most fractures occurring before puberty.  Stature is shorter than average.  Sclerae are normal in color, appearing white or near-white.  Bone deformity is mild to moderate.  Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) is likely.  Rib cage is barrel-shaped.  Face is triangular.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur.  Hearing loss is possible.  Collagen is formed improperly.     When to call the doctor  Parents should contact a healthcare professional if their child exhibits
      any of the symptoms of OI, particularly a tendency to fracture bones
      easily.    Diagnosis  It is often possible to diagnose OI solely on clinical features and x-ray
      findings. Collagen or DNA tests may help confirm a diagnosis of OI; test
      results may take several weeks to confirm. Approximately 10 to 15 percent
      of individuals with mild OI who have collagen testing, and approximately 5
      percent of those who have genetic testing, test negative for OI despite
      having the disorder.  Diagnosis is usually suspected when a baby has bone fractures after having
      suffered no apparent injury. Another indication is small, irregular,
      isolated bones in the sutures between the bones of the skull (wormian
      bones). Sometimes the bluish sclerae serve as a diagnostic clue.
      Unfortunately, because of the unusual nature of the fractures occurring in
      a baby who is not yet mobile, some parents have been accused of  child abuse  before the actual diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta was reached.    Prenatal diagnosis  Testing is available to assist in prenatal diagnosis. Women with OI who
      become pregnant or women who conceive a child with a man who has OI may
      wish to explore prenatal diagnosis. Because of the relatively small risk
      (2–4%) of recurrence of OI type II in a family, families may opt
      for ultrasound studies to determine if a developing fetus has the
      disorder.  Ultrasound is the least invasive procedure for prenatal diagnosis and
      carries the least risk. Using ultrasound, a doctor can examine the
      fetus's skeleton for bowing of the leg or arm bones, fractures,
      shortening, or other bone abnormalities that may indicate OI. Different
      forms of OI may be detected by ultrasound in the second trimester. When OI
      occurs as a new dominant mutation and is found inadvertently on
      ultrasound, it may be difficult to confirm the diagnosis until after
      delivery since other genetic conditions can cause bowing and/or fractures
      prenatally.  Chorionic villus sampling is a procedure that obtains a sampling of cells
      from the placenta for testing. Examination of fetal collagen proteins in
      the tissue can reveal information about the quantitative or qualitative
      collagen defects that leads to OI. When a parent has OI, it is necessary
      for the affected parent to have the results of his or her own collagen
      test available. Chorionic villus sampling can be performed at ten to 12
      weeks of pregnancy.   Amniocentesis is a procedure that involves inserting a thin needle into the uterus,
      into the amniotic sac, and withdrawing a small amount of amniotic fluid.
      Genetic material can be extracted from the fetal cells contained in the
      amniotic fluid and tested for the specific mutation known to cause OI in
      that family. This technique is useful only when the mutation causing OI in
      a particular family has been identified through previous genetic testing
      of affected family members, including previous pregnancies involving a
      baby with OI. Amniocentesis is performed at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy.    Treatment  There are no treatments available to cure OI, nor to prevent most of its
      complications. Most treatments are aimed at treating the fractures and
      bone deformities caused by OI. Splints, casts, braces, and rods are all
      used. Rodding is a surgical procedure in which a metal rod is implanted
      within a bone (usually the long bones of the thigh and leg). This surgery
      is performed when bowing or repeated fractures of these bones has
      interfered with a child's ability to walk.  Other treatments include hearing aids and early capping of teeth. Patients
      may require the use of a walker or wheelchair. Pain may be treated with a variety of medications. Exercise is encouraged as a means to promote muscle and bone strength. Swimming is
      a form of exercise that puts a minimal amount of strain on muscles,
      joints, and bones. Walking is encouraged for those who are able.    Alternative treatment  Alternative treatment such as acupuncture, naturopathic therapies,
      hypnosis, relaxation training, visual imagery, and biofeedback have all
      been used to try to decrease the constant pain of fractures.    Nutritional concerns   Smoking , excessive alcohol and  caffeine  consumption, and steroid medications may deplete bone and exacerbate bone
      fragility.    Prognosis  The lifespan of people with OI types I, III, and IV is not generally
      shortened. The prognosis for people with these types of OI is quite
      variable, depending on the severity of the disorder and the number and
      severity of the fractures and bony deformities.  Fifty percent of all babies with OI type II are stillborn. The rest of
      these babies usually die within a very short time after birth. In the
      early 2000s, some people with type II have lived into young adulthood.    Prevention  As a congenital birth defect, OI cannot be prevented. Individuals at risk
      of having a child with OI should be encouraged to undergo genetic
      counseling to more accurately determine their chances of having a child
      with OI. The risk of fractures can be minimized with bone- and
      muscle-strengthening exercises, rehabilitative therapy, and use of leg
      braces.    Nutritional concerns  Because the symptoms of OI are caused by collagen abnormalities and not a
      calcium deficiency (such as in osteoporosis), supplementation of  vitamins  or  minerals  will not cure the disease. To prevent bone loss related to calcium
      deficiency, which could exacerbate the fragility of bones, it is important
      that children with OI consume an adequate amount of calcium (generally 500
      mg for children ages one to three, 800 mg for children ages four to eight,
      and 1,300 mg a day for preteens and teenagers).    Parental concerns  In cases in which OI is not diagnosed at birth, a child may experience
      numerous fractures of seemingly unexplained cause, leading healthcare
      providers to suspect the child is being abused. Once a child has been
      diagnosed, it may be helpful for parents to carry with them a letter from
      the child's healthcare provider detailing the diagnosis in order to
      facilitate care in an emergency.   KEY TERMS   Chromosome —A microscopic thread-like structure found within each cell of
        the human body and consisting of a complex of proteins and DNA. Humans
        have 46 chromosomes arranged into 23 pairs. Chromosomes contain the
        genetic information necessary to direct the development and functioning
        of all cells and systems in the body. They pass on hereditary traits
        from parents to child (like eye color) and determine whether the child
        will be male or female.   Collagen —The main supportive protein of cartilage, connective tissue,
        tendon, skin, and bone.   Ligament —A type of tough, fibrous tissue that connects bones or cartilage
        and provides support and strength to joints.   Mutation —A permanent change in the genetic material that may alter a
        trait or characteristic of an individual, or manifest as disease. This
        change can be transmitted to offspring.   Sclera —The tough, fibrous, white outer protective covering of the
        eyeball.   Scoliosis —An abnormal, side-to-side curvature of the spine.     Resources    BOOKS  Marini, Joan C. "Osteogenesis Imperfecta." In Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics , 17th ed.
