The Ranger worked as a Tree Officer for some months not too long ago, and got quite an insight into the arcane world of TPOs and irate householders. A bit different from being a real Ranger, where pretty much everyone is glad to see you. A tree officer often has the thankless task of trying to preserve a tree against the wishes of the tree’s owner, who wants to fell the thing to get a sea view, or build a house. For some reason they rarely come out with the truth and say they want to fell it. They usually proffer some excuse, prefaced with “ I like trees but …”. Perhaps the most common of these is the constant refrain heard by tree officers “ But it’s a dangerous tree! “. Often the complainant then over-eggs the pudding with references to their little, blond grandchildren, innocently gamboling underneath the looming tree, which has regularly been heard to creak and groan ominously, and even, believe it or not, sway in the wind! It’s hard not to get cynical about some of these requests. It would be a lot better if they just came out and said “I want to sell off half my garden to build a block of eight flats on it.” Then at least we’d know where we all stood. But, can they always be wrong? Just how dangerous are trees, generically?   Indeed, some individual trees are dangerous and need work. But that does not mean they all are. Often the dangers of trees are considerably overestimated. Just what are the chances of a tree falling on you and killing you? Chris Hastie, arboriculturalist and webmaster of the The UK Tree Care Mailing List recently got fed up with the assumptions that are made about such things. He writes:  After the storms the other month I was phoned by a journalist who questioned me about various things, mostly to do with a very large horse chestnut by the side of a busy road which managed to blow over and do no harm to anything except a lamp post. Trying to explain the nuances of risk management to her and knowing everything I said was going to be massively dumbed down, I started to wish I had a few soundbites at my fingertips.  So Chris took the question at face value and worked out some statistics . He started by pointing out that the chances of being killed by a tree in a public space in the UK is about 1 in 20,000,000 ( according to the UK Health & Safety Executive , “Management of the risk from falling trees – Internal guidance”). So, what about winning the lottery jackpot? Actually, Chris also demonstrated that rather than the 14 million to one which is usually quoted, the chances of winning it are actually better expressed as 1 in 268,920. This is because although the chances of winning with one ticket are indeed 1 in 13,983,816, accidental deaths are usually expressed as the chances of any incident happening to any person in one year. So, assuming a lottery player buys one ticket per week every week for a year, the odds are reduced to 1 in 268,920. Thus a regular lottery player is 75 times more likely to win the lottery jackpot than be killed by a tree in a public space. He goes on with some other sobering illustrations. The total number of accidental deaths in the UK number is over 12,000 per year. About 6 of these are due to trees. So you are 2000 times more likely to die from some other type of accident than by being hit by a falling tree. More specifically, 3,501 people were killed in road traffic accidents in the UK in 2005. So you are around 600 times more likely to be killed in a road accident than by a falling tree. The Ranger adds one of his own – the annual risk of being struck (and not necessarily killed) by lightning is 1 in 10,000,000 . So you are more likely to be hit by a bolt of lightning than killed by a falling tree. That seems to put things into perspective. Anyone else want to have a try? Cite your sources if you do!

Also…is the forest trying to reclaim me, or what? – hebspeaks        Wayne Tyson  says:     27th November, 2017 at 2:50 am      This discussion frequently lacks intellectual discipline. There is too much indulgence in logical fallacies, especially of the straw-man sort. Opinion is no substitute for reason, and believing is no substitute for thinking. Rudeness does not equate with honesty.  “. . . some individual trees are dangerous and need work. But that does not mean they all are.” Be honest, please. NO one is saying that all trees are dangerous. And it must be presumed that the “Ranger” is knowledgeable enough to guarantee that the “work” done on a defective tree will remove the hazard potential and improve the health and strength of the tree.  But it is fallacious to imply that the same degree of risk applies to all trees, greatly stable and those defective and liable to fall in the foreseeable future. Suggested reading: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.  In the cases of the two trees photographed, it is apparent that severe, probably irreparable defects existed before they fell, such as a weak crotch, heart rot, root rot, though there is no substitute for having been there, as the “Ranger” was. We must depend upon him to answer our questions. (Would the “Ranger” please supply the location/address of the tree that fell in the city?)  Risk is an entirely different matter than assessing the potential for tree failure. Those who wish to “preserve” trees in known hazardous condition and are beyond preservation (possessing irreparable defects—if tree work can preserve the tree and cause it to become stronger and stronger with time, by all means preserve it) should be required to pay compensation and punitive damages to the victims if their action or inaction results in damage, injury, or death, including forfeiting their property.  Certainly, the chances that a defective tree will cause damage, injury, or death is far greater in the case of the tree that fell in the city and in the middle of some farmer’s field, but that has nothing to do with assessing whether or not the tree is likely or not likely to fall. In an unmanaged forest, it may be impractical to fell trees that dangerous, but they do kill people. I came within a second or two of certain death when a huge limb fell from a tall pine tree to where I had been standing a moment before. A friend of mine was killed when a tree fell on his vehicle as he was driving down a road. Another friend spent a long time in hospital after a tree branch grazed his ribs. A forest worker I didn’t know was killed by a “widow-maker” (a falling tree branch); his head was obliterated by a direct hit. This latter type of accident is common enough to have a nickname.  As to statistics, “the more you generalize about a population, the less you know about any individual in that population.”   Reply        Adz  says:     21st March, 2018 at 10:28 pm      It’s probably a bit much to ask The Ranger to provide further detail on tree failures they photographed 11 years ago.  There is provision for compensation within the Town and Country Planning Act 1990; if a LPA refuses permission for works and the tree was cause foreseeable harm or damage exceeding £500, within a year of the refusal, they will be liable to pay compensation. This applies to England, I’m not sure how it applies in USA.   Reply          Wayne Tyson  says:     15th July, 2017 at 6:34 pm      A reasoning man is always wrong.

What would you suspect if you saw a black hole in a not-quite-healed old cut as seen in the lead photo?   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     30th July, 2017 at 11:10 pm      Depends entirely on the risk and the target. So in the top pic, the oak was in an agricultural field, not a public place. No pressing need to either inspect or do any work and as far as I know neither was done. In the second pic, the tree was in an urban environment. It should have been inspected and action taken if problems were detected. Looks a lot as if that didn’t happen. But even so, no tree can be 100% safe, even if it’s inspected and work regularly undertaken.   Reply        Wayne Tyson  says:     31st July, 2017 at 12:24 am      There were two questions. Would you answer the second one please?  Also, just who is saying that all trees must be 100% safe?  Thank you.   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     31st July, 2017 at 1:01 am      It’s not really possible to diagnose tree ailments from photos. I didn’t look in the hole so I don’t know what was in it. I’d say the feature needs further examination, for sure. But beyond that I couldn’t say. Here’s a video of the same tree, so have a look and share your conclusions if you like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVgWvZDKWTo  I don’t remember the names of people who asked me if trees could be 100% safe, as it was over ten years ago I was doing the job. Do you need to get in touch with them or something? We could maybe ask on Facebook and see if anyone remembers me.           Wayne Tyson  says:     31st July, 2017 at 4:06 am      Am I to understand that you were physically there at the time and did not look into the hole(s)? I was referring to the one in your photo (which did not appear in the video), but the video revealed another similar one on the “stump.”  While I do agree that one cannot reach definitive CONCLUSIONS based on photos and videos, they sometimes do reveal evidence that would lead one to further investigation. Was any further investigation done? If so, is there a published or unpublished report of any sort? Would you care to comment on what you believe caused the failure?  As to who is claiming that trees should be 100% safe, I had in mind organisations or other authorities.  As to the other tree, it appeared to be dead or dormant, and it appeared to show evidence of rot. Do you believe that trees that are dead or in unrecoverable decline should be preserved? Where was that tree and when did it fail?  Thank you for your prompt and responsive replies.   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     8th August, 2017 at 12:28 pm      I was there to see the oak tree after it fell, it was on private land and not in a public place. As far as I know nobody did any report on it either before or after it fell, nor would one have been expected.  The second image was not my own and I did not see the tree myself, I do not know the circumstances of it but I chose it as it appeared to be in a public place, to contrast with the other one.           Wayne Tyson  says:     31st July, 2017 at 6:36 am      It would seem that the scale is backwards. No tree is 100% dangerous until it destroys. To tree or not to tree, that is the question.   Reply              Malcolm Knowles  says:     26th March, 2017 at 3:38 am      I actually found the Ranger’s approach to human life quite disturbing, very disturbing in fact. Equating a person’s life who you don’t know, with family and friends that you do not know into the statistical aboration of chance whether that be 1 in 10 or 1 in 100 million is a clear example of just how out of touch you are with reality and how little value you place on human life as against a stupid tree. Does it really matter what the chances are? Does it really matter the chances of something else happening is less? If I am fearful thast a tree in my backyard or my neighbour’s backyard will fall on me, or my neighbour, isnt that the issue that should be addressed and not the well being of a tree? Trees can be replanted to replace a removed tree but me, my family, my freinds, my neighbours or even strangers can not. I am not a statistic that you can merely write off, I am real, I am a human being.This nonsense of tree preservation is exactly that nonsense. Remove the source of the problem and plant something else in its place. Its pretty simple but only if you value human life more highly than trees. I clearly do, you clearly don’t and you should be ashamed to justify tree preservation over and above that of human life. Trees are not part of human endeavour. It always amazes me that councild and governments will remove thousands of trees for a new road or housing development but when Mr and Mrs Joe Average want to remove a tree from their backyard all hell breaks loose….its the environment…its the this…its the that…..If its my property and its my tree it should be my decision to remove it, no matter why I want it removed. If you want balance then simply plant another tree in the local park or some other open space….but please dont tell me I must accept the risk of death simply on the basis that the statistical chance of me being killed is greater than winning the lottery…..

The negative poster above obviously has never had a neighbor who wanted to cut down seven 200 year old trees in no danger if dying just because they don’t like leaves or want sun for a mint patch. Buy, they claim they’re afraid that they will fall. Trees provide privacy, sound barriers, habitat, the shade underneath is specific to necessary bacteria and insects. You just can’t replace old-growth trees with saplings and call it even. I’m posting this information on my neighborhood blog today! Thank you.

It had rot in the bottom.  I am grateful to be alive but suffer from permanent nerve and soft tissue damage.  I still love trees and plant them whenever I can, but a property owner should be proactive concerning the health of trees on his property that are near roadways or other areas that humans my travel.  If you are not sure if the tree is stable, you can call a tree professional and usually get a free evaluation of the tree and whether it doe indeed need to come down before it falls on an unsuspecting motorist or pedestrian   Reply          Mark Benniman  says:     12th November, 2015 at 1:47 pm      Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the mental health charity Rethink, claimed “you are more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by someone with schizophrenia”. (therefore more likely to be killed by a tree falling on you 🙂 (actually that is someone you don’t know)  The number of people killed by lightning strikes is around three a year, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, though there are more strikes which cause only injury.  This compares with an average of 32 homicides a year by schizophrenics, according to the Manchester University project.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10358251/Truth-about-dangerous-mental-patients-let-out-to-kill.html   Reply        Don  says:     2nd September, 2015 at 3:28 pm      on my way to work Monday 20 July  on my Valkyrie large limn came down on me broken arm compound fracture  lower leg broken jaw  and noes .

This is for all the people all over the earth, who may or may not be standing, sitting, or living, under a tree for most of their life. What about people who live under the branches of a massive tree? The risk goes up surely? And what about if that tree is very old? Even higher risk. I’ve read that the risk of an old tree dropping a branch is 10% per year. And they’re a lot heavier than they look. You try sleeping under one in a storm and see how you feel!   Reply        John Doe  says:     12th January, 2017 at 12:47 am      This x1000. The chance here is represented as 1 single individual randomly being killed by a tree in a public place while walking under it. This does not apply if you live with one of these trees over your house 24/7. The chance goes up many, many time. For example, 1 in 400 here: http://council-tree-hostages.blogspot.com.au/2017/01/calculating-risk-of-fatality-from.html   Reply          Gail  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      Dear Ranger,  Is there any evidence that risks of personal or property injury from falling trees or branches have changed over the past few decades? Of course you would have to allow for population growth and development.  But my observation is that trees are dying at a very rapidly accelerating rate, with a sharp increase in falling branches and entire trees. Trees of all ages, in various habitats.  thanks,  Gail in NJ, USA   Reply        Nate  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      Yeah.. some creepy stuff huh? I can’t believe that the annual risk of death by lightning is 1 in 18,700,000. So you are more likely to be killed by a bolt of lightning than a falling tree. So that falling huge branch that almost crushed us is was 1 in 18,700,000 likely to happen?!!!! I should play the lottery!   Reply        Adz  says:     23rd November, 2017 at 10:17 pm      No, the risk of death was 1 in 18,700,000. You were one of the overwhelming majority not killed or injured by trees.   Reply          Mark Hartley  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      The odds of dying falling down stairs are about 1 in 1,000,000. The odds of dying from drowning in Australia are about 1 in 300,000. The odds of dying under a general anaesthetic are 1 in 10,000 (source Australian College of Anaesthetists and people choose to undergo elective surgery).  The odds of dying from food poisoning and influenza are each far greater than the odds of dying from trees. In Australia influenza kills more than 1,500 people a year (about 1 in 14,000). In the Australia about 120 people a year die from food poisoning (Australian Academy of Science) which equates to about 1 in 175,000 … perhaps we should also stop eating and breathing when we cut down those dangerous trees   Reply        Chris  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      It’s a weird feeling idly surfing and coming across a discussion about something I said once 🙂   Reply        Graeme Duckworth  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      A couple more points: (1) The chances of winning by buying 52 (differently-numbered) tickets in a single lottery are not the same as the chances of winning at least once in 52 successive attempts with a single ticket. The former’s value is 52/14,000,000 = 0.00000371429 (6sf), which is ever-so-slightly greater than the latter’s, 0.00000371428 (6sf). Hence you are 1.000002 (7sf) times as likely to win by buying 52 tickets in a single week as to win by buying one ticket a week for 52 weeks.  (2) How long would it take to be virtually certain of winning the lottery at least once by buying a single ticket every week? A very long time indeed! If you did this for 1,000 years (i.e. ~52,000 weeks), your chances of winning would be 0.0037 (2sf), i.e. just under 4 in a thousand. If you did this for 100,000 years (~5,200,000 weeks), your chances of winning would be 0.31, i.e. just under one in three. Finally, if you did the lottery for one million years (~52,000,000 weeks), your chances of winning at least once would be 0.9756 (4sf), i.e. nearly 98%, which is getting close to certain. Of course, you’d have spent   Reply        Graeme Duckworth  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      I remember very little of my 1st year probability studies (nearly 30 years ago), but I do remember this … and the probability of winning *at least* once in 52 successive lottery attempts is not the same as the probability of winning once in a single attempt. The best way of thinking about the former probability is to consider the opposite, i.e. the probability of winning precisely no times in 52 attempts.  If the probability of winning on each occasion is 1 in 14 million, then the probability of not winning on each occasion is 13,999,999 in 14,000,000. Therefore the probability of failing to win on every occasion (out of 52) is (13,999,999/14,000,000)^52, i.e. 13,999,999 divided by 14,000,000 and raised to the power of 52. Therefore the probability of winning at least once in these 52 attempts is  1 – ((13,999,999/14,000,000)^52)  A quick calculation in my head (only kidding) gives 0.00000371428 (to six sig. figs.), whereas 1 in 14,000,000 equals 0.0000000714286 (6sf).  Therefore you are 51.9999 (6sf) times as likely to win the lottery entering it 52 times as to win it by entering it only once. This should come as a relief to Camelot, since if it were equally likely to win the lottery once from one attempt as it were to win it from x attempts, there would be no logical reason to enter more than once.   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      You’re kinda right, and kinda wrong. The chances of winning the lottery are, of course, exactly the same for any given ticket. But the chances of winning it over a given period of time are not the same, if you play regularly. In this case it’s a year, so the chances of a weekly player winning during that year are 52 times the chances of a single ticket winning. Or think of it another way – if all the tickets were bought on the same day, who has the greater chance of winning, someone who buys one ticket, or someone who buys 52 tickets?   Reply        SimonTeW  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      I haven’t done statistics since high school, over 20 years ago, so I’m a bit hazy. But I thought the probability of winning a lottery ticket if you played every week for a year was the same as if you played only once. This is because the probability isn’t cumulative – you have just the same probability of winning next week whether or not you played this week. If this were not the case then if you played long enough the probability of winning would be 1: an absolute certainty.  This is in contrast to some probabilities that are cumulative, eg If I’m waiting for a bus, the longer I wait the more likely it is that the bus will appear (except in London where they operate using probability from another dimension).

By Graham Allison    February 19, 2016         Terror-watchers in Massachusetts have a new cause for alarm: The sky really is falling — or at least, objects are falling from the skies. Earlier this month, two of Canton’s 21,000 residents, sadly, were struck dead by tree limbs in less than 24 hours. As various commentators asked: How likely is that? Could that really be a coincidence? Polls find that 80 percent of Americans expect another major terrorist attack in the near future. Fifty-one percent fear that they or one of their family members will be the victim of such an attack. Little wonder, then, that Republican voters in South Carolina have said terrorism is the most important issue facing the country. Those of us who live in the snowbelt now discover that we must not only look out for threats from abroad. Additional dangers lurk directly above us as we attempt to keep our families safe. Terrorism experts — and their eager amplifiers in the media — are quick to note any whiff of links to Islamist jihadists or cyberterrorists. So far, however, no one appears to have discovered any direct connection between those perpetrators and falling objects. Indeed, when the nation’s top intelligence officers presented their annual worldwide threat assessment to Congress earlier this month, the threat from falling objects was nowhere to be found. They catalogued threats from North Korea, cyberterrorists, and Al Qaeda, and predicted an ISIS-sponsored terrorist attack in the US in 2016 — but they said nothing about the threat of falling objects — despite the fact that they kill nearly 700 people in the United States every year.   Advertisement     As sane adults think about risks to themselves and their families, how should they compare the threat of killer tree limbs and Islamist terrorists? How much more likely is an American to be killed in the year ahead by terrorists than by falling objects?    Get Truth and Consequences in your inbox:  Michael A. Cohen takes on the absurdities and hypocrisies of the current political moment.        Sign Up      Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here    Comparing causes of violent deaths in the past decade, a person living in the United States is more than over 100 times more likely to be killed by falling objects than by jihadi terrorists. To repeat: On average, 4 people in the United States have been killed by jihadi terrorist attacks each year over the past decade; 688 by falling objects.  Falling objects are hardly the only violent death Americans should fear more than jihadi terrorism. Your chance of being killed by lightning is eight times that of dying from a jihadi terrorist attack; of being murdered with a firearm, 2,931 times greater. You are even slightly more likely to be killed by far-right-wing, homegrown terrorists in the United States than by jihadis. What are we to make of these brute facts? First, for anyone tempted to keep their family indoors to avoid getting hit by a limb, the message is: get real. The truth is that we live in a dangerous world. We can deny that truth and be shocked when violence happens. We can increase risks to ourselves by reckless actions, from driving while intoxicated to smoking to lingering below snow-laden limbs of old trees. And we can decrease risks like these by taking prudent precautions. Second, hysteria about the threat of jihadi terrorism is just that: hysterical. Media that scream terror distorts reality. Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other mutants of Islamist jihadism are real threats that must be addressed and defeated. But terror-mongering that elevates foreign jihadists to levels where a majority of Americans fear for their families’ lives is no more reasonable than fears of witches that led our ancestors in 17th-century Salem to acts we now find insane.

But every once in a while bad things happen. Last month, a woman was killed in Oregon while following her husband when a cedar tree fell on top of her car. The woman was also pregnant and tragically lost the child, as well. Source: The Oregonian       Related Questions    What state are most serial killers from?

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

(Christophe Ena/EPA)   If you are worried that ISIS might strike the United States and want to prevent the loss of American lives, consider urging Congress to invest in diabetes and Alzheimer’s research.  Terrorism is effective in doing what its name says: inspiring profound fear. But despite unremitting coverage of the Paris attacks , an objective examination of the facts shows that terrorism is an insignificant danger to the vast majority of people in the West.  You, your family members, your friends, and your community are all significantly more at risk from a host of threats that we usually ignore than from terrorism. For instance, while the Paris attacks left some 130 people dead, roughly three times that number of French citizens died on that same day from cancer.  In the United States, an individual’s likelihood of being hurt or killed by a terrorist (whether an Islamist radical or some other variety) is negligible.  Consider, for instance, that since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Americans have been no more likely to die at the hands of terrorists than being crushed to death by unstable televisions and furniture . Meanwhile, in the time it has taken you to read until this point, at least one American has died from a heart attack . Within the hour, a fellow citizen will have died from skin cancer . Roughly five minutes after that, a military veteran will commit suicide . And by the time you turn the lights off to sleep this evening, somewhere around 100 Americans will have died throughout the day in vehicular accidents – the equivalent of “a plane full of people crashing, killing everyone on board, every single day.” Daniel Kahneman, professor emeritus at Princeton University, has observed that “[e]ven in countries that have been targets of intensive terror campaigns, such as Israel, the weekly number of casualties almost never [comes] close to the number of traffic deaths.”  No one in the United States will die from ISIS’s —or anyone’s — terrorism today.  What accounts for the fear that terrorism inspires, considering that its actual risk in the United States and other Western countries is so low? The answer lies in basic human psychology. Scholars have repeatedly found that individuals have strong tendencies to miscalculate risk likelihood in predictable ways.  For instance, individuals’ sense of control directly influences their feeling about whether they are susceptible to a given risk. Thus, for instance, although driving is more likely to result in deadly accidents than flying, individuals tend to feel that the latter is riskier than the former. Flying involves giving up control to the pilot. The resulting sense of vulnerability increases the feeling of risk, inflating it far beyond the actual underlying risks.  When people dread a particular hazard, and when it can harm large numbers at once, it’s far more likely that someone will see it as riskier than it is–and riskier than more serious hazards without those characteristics. For instance, people have been found to estimate that the number killed each year by tornadoes and floods are about the same as those killed by asthma and diabetes. But the latter (diabetes, in particular) account for far more deaths each year than the former. In fact, in the year that study was conducted, actual annual diabetes deaths were estimated in the  tens of thousands while fewer than 1,000 people died in tornadoes.  Islamist terrorism has all three of these characteristics, inspiring excessive fear — surely by design. For instance, the Paris attacks harmed large numbers; its victims could have done very little to escape it, since the timing and location of such attacks are unpredictable; and the idea of being shot or blown up by a mysterious set of masked extremists is incredibly dreadful.  When we miscalculate risks, we sometimes behave in ways that are riskier than those we are trying to avoid. For instance, in the months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, millions of Americans elected not to fly. A significant proportion decided to drive to their destinations instead. Driving is more dangerous than flying. And so one scholar of risk, Gerd Gigerenzer, calculated that more people died from the resulting automobile accidents than the total number of individuals who were killed aboard the four hijacked planes Sept. 11.  Kahneman believes that the news media’s disproportionate focus on cases of Western terrorism reinforces such mistaken perceptions. As he explains in his book “ Thinking, Fast and Slow ,” “extremely vivid image[s] of death and damage” resulting from terrorist attacks are “reinforced by media attention and frequent conversation,” leaving us with highly accessible memories of such events. When people who have been exposed to such coverage later assess how likely more terrorism is, such events come readily to mind — and so they are likely to assign probabilities biased upward.  America’s panicked obsession with Islamist terrorism is understandable but may skew public policies in costly ways. In particular, a serious public policy problem emerges when unsubstantiated fear fuels excessive public spending. More than a decade after the Sept. 11  terrorist attacks, the U.S. government has committed trillions of dollars to fighting the war on terror . Certainly, some – perhaps even most – of this funding is warranted.  Consider, however, that federal spending on improving vehicular safety and research for Alzheimer’s and diabetes pales in comparison. Yet traffic deaths, Alzheimer’s and diabetes account for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year in the United States.  Whether diverting counterterrorism funding to research in Alzheimer’s and diabetes research would save more American lives depends on the respective marginal benefits. But our government is unlikely to objectively evaluate its investments as long as most Americans have outsized fears of the threat of Islamist terrorist attacks.  To be clear, I’m not suggesting that the United States and other Western countries are facing no risk of more terror. Quite the contrary: We will almost certainly be attacked by terrorists again during the coming years and decades.  But people will also die from other unlikely events during this same period: a number of unlucky individuals will die after falling out of bed. Others will die of head injuries from coconuts falling from trees. The likelihood that you or those you love will be directly affected by any of this in your lifetime is exceedingly small.  And so perhaps the best way to counter terrorists is to do just as the French pianist who played “ Imagine ” in public outside the Bataclan did after the attack, or as did the widower whose wife died in the attack, and whose open letter to the terrorists included this: “I will insult you with my happiness.” We can refuse to give them the fear they so desperately want from us.

The Ranger worked as a Tree Officer for some months not too long ago, and got quite an insight into the arcane world of TPOs and irate householders. A bit different from being a real Ranger, where pretty much everyone is glad to see you. A tree officer often has the thankless task of trying to preserve a tree against the wishes of the tree’s owner, who wants to fell the thing to get a sea view, or build a house. For some reason they rarely come out with the truth and say they want to fell it. They usually proffer some excuse, prefaced with “ I like trees but …”. Perhaps the most common of these is the constant refrain heard by tree officers “ But it’s a dangerous tree! “. Often the complainant then over-eggs the pudding with references to their little, blond grandchildren, innocently gamboling underneath the looming tree, which has regularly been heard to creak and groan ominously, and even, believe it or not, sway in the wind! It’s hard not to get cynical about some of these requests. It would be a lot better if they just came out and said “I want to sell off half my garden to build a block of eight flats on it.” Then at least we’d know where we all stood. But, can they always be wrong? Just how dangerous are trees, generically?   Indeed, some individual trees are dangerous and need work. But that does not mean they all are. Often the dangers of trees are considerably overestimated. Just what are the chances of a tree falling on you and killing you? Chris Hastie, arboriculturalist and webmaster of the The UK Tree Care Mailing List recently got fed up with the assumptions that are made about such things. He writes:  After the storms the other month I was phoned by a journalist who questioned me about various things, mostly to do with a very large horse chestnut by the side of a busy road which managed to blow over and do no harm to anything except a lamp post. Trying to explain the nuances of risk management to her and knowing everything I said was going to be massively dumbed down, I started to wish I had a few soundbites at my fingertips.  So Chris took the question at face value and worked out some statistics . He started by pointing out that the chances of being killed by a tree in a public space in the UK is about 1 in 20,000,000 ( according to the UK Health & Safety Executive , “Management of the risk from falling trees – Internal guidance”). So, what about winning the lottery jackpot? Actually, Chris also demonstrated that rather than the 14 million to one which is usually quoted, the chances of winning it are actually better expressed as 1 in 268,920. This is because although the chances of winning with one ticket are indeed 1 in 13,983,816, accidental deaths are usually expressed as the chances of any incident happening to any person in one year. So, assuming a lottery player buys one ticket per week every week for a year, the odds are reduced to 1 in 268,920. Thus a regular lottery player is 75 times more likely to win the lottery jackpot than be killed by a tree in a public space. He goes on with some other sobering illustrations. The total number of accidental deaths in the UK number is over 12,000 per year. About 6 of these are due to trees. So you are 2000 times more likely to die from some other type of accident than by being hit by a falling tree. More specifically, 3,501 people were killed in road traffic accidents in the UK in 2005. So you are around 600 times more likely to be killed in a road accident than by a falling tree. The Ranger adds one of his own – the annual risk of being struck (and not necessarily killed) by lightning is 1 in 10,000,000 . So you are more likely to be hit by a bolt of lightning than killed by a falling tree. That seems to put things into perspective. Anyone else want to have a try? Cite your sources if you do!

Also…is the forest trying to reclaim me, or what? – hebspeaks        Wayne Tyson  says:     27th November, 2017 at 2:50 am      This discussion frequently lacks intellectual discipline. There is too much indulgence in logical fallacies, especially of the straw-man sort. Opinion is no substitute for reason, and believing is no substitute for thinking. Rudeness does not equate with honesty.  “. . . some individual trees are dangerous and need work. But that does not mean they all are.” Be honest, please. NO one is saying that all trees are dangerous. And it must be presumed that the “Ranger” is knowledgeable enough to guarantee that the “work” done on a defective tree will remove the hazard potential and improve the health and strength of the tree.  But it is fallacious to imply that the same degree of risk applies to all trees, greatly stable and those defective and liable to fall in the foreseeable future. Suggested reading: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.  In the cases of the two trees photographed, it is apparent that severe, probably irreparable defects existed before they fell, such as a weak crotch, heart rot, root rot, though there is no substitute for having been there, as the “Ranger” was. We must depend upon him to answer our questions. (Would the “Ranger” please supply the location/address of the tree that fell in the city?)  Risk is an entirely different matter than assessing the potential for tree failure. Those who wish to “preserve” trees in known hazardous condition and are beyond preservation (possessing irreparable defects—if tree work can preserve the tree and cause it to become stronger and stronger with time, by all means preserve it) should be required to pay compensation and punitive damages to the victims if their action or inaction results in damage, injury, or death, including forfeiting their property.  Certainly, the chances that a defective tree will cause damage, injury, or death is far greater in the case of the tree that fell in the city and in the middle of some farmer’s field, but that has nothing to do with assessing whether or not the tree is likely or not likely to fall. In an unmanaged forest, it may be impractical to fell trees that dangerous, but they do kill people. I came within a second or two of certain death when a huge limb fell from a tall pine tree to where I had been standing a moment before. A friend of mine was killed when a tree fell on his vehicle as he was driving down a road. Another friend spent a long time in hospital after a tree branch grazed his ribs. A forest worker I didn’t know was killed by a “widow-maker” (a falling tree branch); his head was obliterated by a direct hit. This latter type of accident is common enough to have a nickname.  As to statistics, “the more you generalize about a population, the less you know about any individual in that population.”   Reply        Adz  says:     21st March, 2018 at 10:28 pm      It’s probably a bit much to ask The Ranger to provide further detail on tree failures they photographed 11 years ago.  There is provision for compensation within the Town and Country Planning Act 1990; if a LPA refuses permission for works and the tree was cause foreseeable harm or damage exceeding £500, within a year of the refusal, they will be liable to pay compensation. This applies to England, I’m not sure how it applies in USA.   Reply          Wayne Tyson  says:     15th July, 2017 at 6:34 pm      A reasoning man is always wrong.

What would you suspect if you saw a black hole in a not-quite-healed old cut as seen in the lead photo?   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     30th July, 2017 at 11:10 pm      Depends entirely on the risk and the target. So in the top pic, the oak was in an agricultural field, not a public place. No pressing need to either inspect or do any work and as far as I know neither was done. In the second pic, the tree was in an urban environment. It should have been inspected and action taken if problems were detected. Looks a lot as if that didn’t happen. But even so, no tree can be 100% safe, even if it’s inspected and work regularly undertaken.   Reply        Wayne Tyson  says:     31st July, 2017 at 12:24 am      There were two questions. Would you answer the second one please?  Also, just who is saying that all trees must be 100% safe?  Thank you.   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     31st July, 2017 at 1:01 am      It’s not really possible to diagnose tree ailments from photos. I didn’t look in the hole so I don’t know what was in it. I’d say the feature needs further examination, for sure. But beyond that I couldn’t say. Here’s a video of the same tree, so have a look and share your conclusions if you like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVgWvZDKWTo  I don’t remember the names of people who asked me if trees could be 100% safe, as it was over ten years ago I was doing the job. Do you need to get in touch with them or something? We could maybe ask on Facebook and see if anyone remembers me.           Wayne Tyson  says:     31st July, 2017 at 4:06 am      Am I to understand that you were physically there at the time and did not look into the hole(s)? I was referring to the one in your photo (which did not appear in the video), but the video revealed another similar one on the “stump.”  While I do agree that one cannot reach definitive CONCLUSIONS based on photos and videos, they sometimes do reveal evidence that would lead one to further investigation. Was any further investigation done? If so, is there a published or unpublished report of any sort? Would you care to comment on what you believe caused the failure?  As to who is claiming that trees should be 100% safe, I had in mind organisations or other authorities.  As to the other tree, it appeared to be dead or dormant, and it appeared to show evidence of rot. Do you believe that trees that are dead or in unrecoverable decline should be preserved? Where was that tree and when did it fail?  Thank you for your prompt and responsive replies.   Reply        The Virtual Ranger  says:     8th August, 2017 at 12:28 pm      I was there to see the oak tree after it fell, it was on private land and not in a public place. As far as I know nobody did any report on it either before or after it fell, nor would one have been expected.  The second image was not my own and I did not see the tree myself, I do not know the circumstances of it but I chose it as it appeared to be in a public place, to contrast with the other one.           Wayne Tyson  says:     31st July, 2017 at 6:36 am      It would seem that the scale is backwards. No tree is 100% dangerous until it destroys. To tree or not to tree, that is the question.   Reply              Malcolm Knowles  says:     26th March, 2017 at 3:38 am      I actually found the Ranger’s approach to human life quite disturbing, very disturbing in fact. Equating a person’s life who you don’t know, with family and friends that you do not know into the statistical aboration of chance whether that be 1 in 10 or 1 in 100 million is a clear example of just how out of touch you are with reality and how little value you place on human life as against a stupid tree. Does it really matter what the chances are? Does it really matter the chances of something else happening is less? If I am fearful thast a tree in my backyard or my neighbour’s backyard will fall on me, or my neighbour, isnt that the issue that should be addressed and not the well being of a tree? Trees can be replanted to replace a removed tree but me, my family, my freinds, my neighbours or even strangers can not. I am not a statistic that you can merely write off, I am real, I am a human being.This nonsense of tree preservation is exactly that nonsense. Remove the source of the problem and plant something else in its place. Its pretty simple but only if you value human life more highly than trees. I clearly do, you clearly don’t and you should be ashamed to justify tree preservation over and above that of human life. Trees are not part of human endeavour. It always amazes me that councild and governments will remove thousands of trees for a new road or housing development but when Mr and Mrs Joe Average want to remove a tree from their backyard all hell breaks loose….its the environment…its the this…its the that…..If its my property and its my tree it should be my decision to remove it, no matter why I want it removed. If you want balance then simply plant another tree in the local park or some other open space….but please dont tell me I must accept the risk of death simply on the basis that the statistical chance of me being killed is greater than winning the lottery…..

The negative poster above obviously has never had a neighbor who wanted to cut down seven 200 year old trees in no danger if dying just because they don’t like leaves or want sun for a mint patch. Buy, they claim they’re afraid that they will fall. Trees provide privacy, sound barriers, habitat, the shade underneath is specific to necessary bacteria and insects. You just can’t replace old-growth trees with saplings and call it even. I’m posting this information on my neighborhood blog today! Thank you.

It had rot in the bottom.  I am grateful to be alive but suffer from permanent nerve and soft tissue damage.  I still love trees and plant them whenever I can, but a property owner should be proactive concerning the health of trees on his property that are near roadways or other areas that humans my travel.  If you are not sure if the tree is stable, you can call a tree professional and usually get a free evaluation of the tree and whether it doe indeed need to come down before it falls on an unsuspecting motorist or pedestrian   Reply          Mark Benniman  says:     12th November, 2015 at 1:47 pm      Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the mental health charity Rethink, claimed “you are more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by someone with schizophrenia”. (therefore more likely to be killed by a tree falling on you 🙂 (actually that is someone you don’t know)  The number of people killed by lightning strikes is around three a year, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, though there are more strikes which cause only injury.

This is for all the people all over the earth, who may or may not be standing, sitting, or living, under a tree for most of their life. What about people who live under the branches of a massive tree? The risk goes up surely? And what about if that tree is very old? Even higher risk. I’ve read that the risk of an old tree dropping a branch is 10% per year. And they’re a lot heavier than they look. You try sleeping under one in a storm and see how you feel!   Reply        John Doe  says:     12th January, 2017 at 12:47 am      This x1000. The chance here is represented as 1 single individual randomly being killed by a tree in a public place while walking under it. This does not apply if you live with one of these trees over your house 24/7. The chance goes up many, many time. For example, 1 in 400 here: http://council-tree-hostages.blogspot.com.au/2017/01/calculating-risk-of-fatality-from.html   Reply          Gail  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      Dear Ranger,  Is there any evidence that risks of personal or property injury from falling trees or branches have changed over the past few decades? Of course you would have to allow for population growth and development.  But my observation is that trees are dying at a very rapidly accelerating rate, with a sharp increase in falling branches and entire trees. Trees of all ages, in various habitats.  thanks,  Gail in NJ, USA   Reply        Nate  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      Yeah.. some creepy stuff huh? I can’t believe that the annual risk of death by lightning is 1 in 18,700,000. So you are more likely to be killed by a bolt of lightning than a falling tree. So that falling huge branch that almost crushed us is was 1 in 18,700,000 likely to happen?!!!! I should play the lottery!   Reply        Adz  says:     23rd November, 2017 at 10:17 pm      No, the risk of death was 1 in 18,700,000. You were one of the overwhelming majority not killed or injured by trees.   Reply          Mark Hartley  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      The odds of dying falling down stairs are about 1 in 1,000,000. The odds of dying from drowning in Australia are about 1 in 300,000. The odds of dying under a general anaesthetic are 1 in 10,000 (source Australian College of Anaesthetists and people choose to undergo elective surgery).  The odds of dying from food poisoning and influenza are each far greater than the odds of dying from trees. In Australia influenza kills more than 1,500 people a year (about 1 in 14,000). In the Australia about 120 people a year die from food poisoning (Australian Academy of Science) which equates to about 1 in 175,000 … perhaps we should also stop eating and breathing when we cut down those dangerous trees   Reply        Chris  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      It’s a weird feeling idly surfing and coming across a discussion about something I said once 🙂   Reply        Graeme Duckworth  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      A couple more points: (1) The chances of winning by buying 52 (differently-numbered) tickets in a single lottery are not the same as the chances of winning at least once in 52 successive attempts with a single ticket. The former’s value is 52/14,000,000 = 0.00000371429 (6sf), which is ever-so-slightly greater than the latter’s, 0.00000371428 (6sf). Hence you are 1.000002 (7sf) times as likely to win by buying 52 tickets in a single week as to win by buying one ticket a week for 52 weeks.  (2) How long would it take to be virtually certain of winning the lottery at least once by buying a single ticket every week? A very long time indeed! If you did this for 1,000 years (i.e. ~52,000 weeks), your chances of winning would be 0.0037 (2sf), i.e. just under 4 in a thousand. If you did this for 100,000 years (~5,200,000 weeks), your chances of winning would be 0.31, i.e. just under one in three. Finally, if you did the lottery for one million years (~52,000,000 weeks), your chances of winning at least once would be 0.9756 (4sf), i.e. nearly 98%, which is getting close to certain. Of course, you’d have spent   Reply        Graeme Duckworth  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      I remember very little of my 1st year probability studies (nearly 30 years ago), but I do remember this … and the probability of winning *at least* once in 52 successive lottery attempts is not the same as the probability of winning once in a single attempt. The best way of thinking about the former probability is to consider the opposite, i.e. the probability of winning precisely no times in 52 attempts.  If the probability of winning on each occasion is 1 in 14 million, then the probability of not winning on each occasion is 13,999,999 in 14,000,000. Therefore the probability of failing to win on every occasion (out of 52) is (13,999,999/14,000,000)^52, i.e. 13,999,999 divided by 14,000,000 and raised to the power of 52. Therefore the probability of winning at least once in these 52 attempts is  1 – ((13,999,999/14,000,000)^52)  A quick calculation in my head (only kidding) gives 0.00000371428 (to six sig. figs.), whereas 1 in 14,000,000 equals 0.0000000714286 (6sf).  Therefore you are 51.9999 (6sf) times as likely to win the lottery entering it 52 times as to win it by entering it only once. This should come as a relief to Camelot, since if it were equally likely to win the lottery once from one attempt as it were to win it from x attempts, there would be no logical reason to enter more than once.

The chances of winning the lottery are, of course, exactly the same for any given ticket. But the chances of winning it over a given period of time are not the same, if you play regularly. In this case it’s a year, so the chances of a weekly player winning during that year are 52 times the chances of a single ticket winning. Or think of it another way – if all the tickets were bought on the same day, who has the greater chance of winning, someone who buys one ticket, or someone who buys 52 tickets?   Reply        SimonTeW  says:     12th May, 2012 at 6:12 pm      I haven’t done statistics since high school, over 20 years ago, so I’m a bit hazy. But I thought the probability of winning a lottery ticket if you played every week for a year was the same as if you played only once. This is because the probability isn’t cumulative – you have just the same probability of winning next week whether or not you played this week. If this were not the case then if you played long enough the probability of winning would be 1: an absolute certainty.  This is in contrast to some probabilities that are cumulative, eg If I’m waiting for a bus, the longer I wait the more likely it is that the bus will appear (except in London where they operate using probability from another dimension).

By Graham Allison    February 19, 2016         Terror-watchers in Massachusetts have a new cause for alarm: The sky really is falling — or at least, objects are falling from the skies. Earlier this month, two of Canton’s 21,000 residents, sadly, were struck dead by tree limbs in less than 24 hours. As various commentators asked: How likely is that? Could that really be a coincidence? Polls find that 80 percent of Americans expect another major terrorist attack in the near future. Fifty-one percent fear that they or one of their family members will be the victim of such an attack. Little wonder, then, that Republican voters in South Carolina have said terrorism is the most important issue facing the country. Those of us who live in the snowbelt now discover that we must not only look out for threats from abroad. Additional dangers lurk directly above us as we attempt to keep our families safe. Terrorism experts — and their eager amplifiers in the media — are quick to note any whiff of links to Islamist jihadists or cyberterrorists. So far, however, no one appears to have discovered any direct connection between those perpetrators and falling objects. Indeed, when the nation’s top intelligence officers presented their annual worldwide threat assessment to Congress earlier this month, the threat from falling objects was nowhere to be found. They catalogued threats from North Korea, cyberterrorists, and Al Qaeda, and predicted an ISIS-sponsored terrorist attack in the US in 2016 — but they said nothing about the threat of falling objects — despite the fact that they kill nearly 700 people in the United States every year.   Advertisement     As sane adults think about risks to themselves and their families, how should they compare the threat of killer tree limbs and Islamist terrorists? How much more likely is an American to be killed in the year ahead by terrorists than by falling objects?    Get Truth and Consequences in your inbox:  Michael A. Cohen takes on the absurdities and hypocrisies of the current political moment.        Sign Up      Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here    Comparing causes of violent deaths in the past decade, a person living in the United States is more than over 100 times more likely to be killed by falling objects than by jihadi terrorists. To repeat: On average, 4 people in the United States have been killed by jihadi terrorist attacks each year over the past decade; 688 by falling objects.  Falling objects are hardly the only violent death Americans should fear more than jihadi terrorism. Your chance of being killed by lightning is eight times that of dying from a jihadi terrorist attack; of being murdered with a firearm, 2,931 times greater. You are even slightly more likely to be killed by far-right-wing, homegrown terrorists in the United States than by jihadis. What are we to make of these brute facts? First, for anyone tempted to keep their family indoors to avoid getting hit by a limb, the message is: get real. The truth is that we live in a dangerous world. We can deny that truth and be shocked when violence happens. We can increase risks to ourselves by reckless actions, from driving while intoxicated to smoking to lingering below snow-laden limbs of old trees. And we can decrease risks like these by taking prudent precautions. Second, hysteria about the threat of jihadi terrorism is just that: hysterical. Media that scream terror distorts reality. Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other mutants of Islamist jihadism are real threats that must be addressed and defeated. But terror-mongering that elevates foreign jihadists to levels where a majority of Americans fear for their families’ lives is no more reasonable than fears of witches that led our ancestors in 17th-century Salem to acts we now find insane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

(Christophe Ena/EPA)   If you are worried that ISIS might strike the United States and want to prevent the loss of American lives, consider urging Congress to invest in diabetes and Alzheimer’s research.  Terrorism is effective in doing what its name says: inspiring profound fear. But despite unremitting coverage of the Paris attacks , an objective examination of the facts shows that terrorism is an insignificant danger to the vast majority of people in the West.  You, your family members, your friends, and your community are all significantly more at risk from a host of threats that we usually ignore than from terrorism. For instance, while the Paris attacks left some 130 people dead, roughly three times that number of French citizens died on that same day from cancer.  In the United States, an individual’s likelihood of being hurt or killed by a terrorist (whether an Islamist radical or some other variety) is negligible.  Consider, for instance, that since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Americans have been no more likely to die at the hands of terrorists than being crushed to death by unstable televisions and furniture . Meanwhile, in the time it has taken you to read until this point, at least one American has died from a heart attack . Within the hour, a fellow citizen will have died from skin cancer . Roughly five minutes after that, a military veteran will commit suicide . And by the time you turn the lights off to sleep this evening, somewhere around 100 Americans will have died throughout the day in vehicular accidents – the equivalent of “a plane full of people crashing, killing everyone on board, every single day.” Daniel Kahneman, professor emeritus at Princeton University, has observed that “[e]ven in countries that have been targets of intensive terror campaigns, such as Israel, the weekly number of casualties almost never [comes] close to the number of traffic deaths.”  No one in the United States will die from ISIS’s —or anyone’s — terrorism today.  What accounts for the fear that terrorism inspires, considering that its actual risk in the United States and other Western countries is so low? The answer lies in basic human psychology. Scholars have repeatedly found that individuals have strong tendencies to miscalculate risk likelihood in predictable ways.  For instance, individuals’ sense of control directly influences their feeling about whether they are susceptible to a given risk. Thus, for instance, although driving is more likely to result in deadly accidents than flying, individuals tend to feel that the latter is riskier than the former. Flying involves giving up control to the pilot. The resulting sense of vulnerability increases the feeling of risk, inflating it far beyond the actual underlying risks.  When people dread a particular hazard, and when it can harm large numbers at once, it’s far more likely that someone will see it as riskier than it is–and riskier than more serious hazards without those characteristics. For instance, people have been found to estimate that the number killed each year by tornadoes and floods are about the same as those killed by asthma and diabetes. But the latter (diabetes, in particular) account for far more deaths each year than the former. In fact, in the year that study was conducted, actual annual diabetes deaths were estimated in the  tens of thousands while fewer than 1,000 people died in tornadoes.  Islamist terrorism has all three of these characteristics, inspiring excessive fear — surely by design. For instance, the Paris attacks harmed large numbers; its victims could have done very little to escape it, since the timing and location of such attacks are unpredictable; and the idea of being shot or blown up by a mysterious set of masked extremists is incredibly dreadful.  When we miscalculate risks, we sometimes behave in ways that are riskier than those we are trying to avoid. For instance, in the months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, millions of Americans elected not to fly. A significant proportion decided to drive to their destinations instead. Driving is more dangerous than flying. And so one scholar of risk, Gerd Gigerenzer, calculated that more people died from the resulting automobile accidents than the total number of individuals who were killed aboard the four hijacked planes Sept. 11.  Kahneman believes that the news media’s disproportionate focus on cases of Western terrorism reinforces such mistaken perceptions. As he explains in his book “ Thinking, Fast and Slow ,” “extremely vivid image[s] of death and damage” resulting from terrorist attacks are “reinforced by media attention and frequent conversation,” leaving us with highly accessible memories of such events. When people who have been exposed to such coverage later assess how likely more terrorism is, such events come readily to mind — and so they are likely to assign probabilities biased upward.  America’s panicked obsession with Islamist terrorism is understandable but may skew public policies in costly ways. In particular, a serious public policy problem emerges when unsubstantiated fear fuels excessive public spending. More than a decade after the Sept. 11  terrorist attacks, the U.S. government has committed trillions of dollars to fighting the war on terror . Certainly, some – perhaps even most – of this funding is warranted.  Consider, however, that federal spending on improving vehicular safety and research for Alzheimer’s and diabetes pales in comparison. Yet traffic deaths, Alzheimer’s and diabetes account for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year in the United States.  Whether diverting counterterrorism funding to research in Alzheimer’s and diabetes research would save more American lives depends on the respective marginal benefits. But our government is unlikely to objectively evaluate its investments as long as most Americans have outsized fears of the threat of Islamist terrorist attacks.  To be clear, I’m not suggesting that the United States and other Western countries are facing no risk of more terror. Quite the contrary: We will almost certainly be attacked by terrorists again during the coming years and decades.  But people will also die from other unlikely events during this same period: a number of unlucky individuals will die after falling out of bed. Others will die of head injuries from coconuts falling from trees. The likelihood that you or those you love will be directly affected by any of this in your lifetime is exceedingly small.  And so perhaps the best way to counter terrorists is to do just as the French pianist who played “ Imagine ” in public outside the Bataclan did after the attack, or as did the widower whose wife died in the attack, and whose open letter to the terrorists included this: “I will insult you with my happiness.” We can refuse to give them the fear they so desperately want from us.
