Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I am pregnant and I was curious on the probability that our son will have red hair. My husband has bright red hair, and so did his mom. My grandmother, father and all my aunts and great grandmother had fire red hair while young. I have brownish-red hair. I would just like to know what our odds are.        -A curious adult from South Carolina   November 14, 2012  Usually these questions are tough to answer but not this time.  You (and I) are lucky enough to have all the right pieces in place to answer the question.  Because your husband and your dad have red hair, I can say pretty confidently that each of your kids has around a 50% chance for red hair.  This is so easy to figure out because we can figure out what red hair genes you and your husband have.  As I’ll show below, with that information in hand, figuring out your kids’ chances is a snap.  And this kind of analysis isn’t restricted to just red hair.  What I talk about here will work for blue eyes, green eyes, O blood type and any other simple recessive traits.  What I’ll do for the rest of the answer is show how I came up with the 50% number.  It has to do with the fact that we get one copy of each of our genes from each parent and that some traits can stay hidden.   Crouching Traits, Hidden Versions  Genes are pieces of DNA that each have the instructions for one small part of you.  So there is a gene that determines whether or not you’ll have brown eyes, another that determines green eyes, still another that determines whether or not you’ll have red hair and so on for each of your other 20,000 or so genes.  It is the red hair gene we are obviously interested in here.  The key gene involved in red hair is called MC1R.  It comes in two versions that we will call not-red and red.  For reasons that I’ll explain in a bit, I’ll call the not-red version R and the red version r.  We all have two sets of most of our genes--one set from mom and the other from dad.  This means we have two copies of the MC1R gene too.  So we have two copies of the MC1R gene and it comes in two versions.  Here are the three possible combinations of MC1R genes:    Remembering that R means not red and r means red, two of these three combinations are easy to figure out.  RR would mean not red and rr would mean red.  But what about Rr?  Turns out Rr almost never has red hair (although they can have red highlights).  This is because the R version of the MC1R gene is dominant over the recessive r version.  R beats out r and so an Rr person does not have red hair.  (In genetics, a capital letter means the dominant or winning version and a lower case letter means the recessive version.)  With this information, we can fill in our table like so:    We need just one more bit of information to figure out the chances that your kids will have red hair.  That final piece is that when we have kids, we pass just one of our copies down.  And that this copy is chosen at random. (Well, I guess there were two bits of information!)  So for example, an Rr person has a 50% chance of passing down an R and a 50% chance of passing down an r each time he or she has a child.  This is where your 50% comes from.   Figuring You Out  Now we are ready to figure out you and your husband’s genes.  From that, we can figure out your chances for having a redhead.  Let’s do the easy one first—your husband.  Since he has red hair, odds are he has two copies of the red version of the MC1R gene.  He is rr.  We can figure out your genes because of your father.  Since he is a redhead, he is rr.  What that means for you is that he had to pass you an r…that is all he had to give.  So we know you have at least one r.  But since you don’t have red hair, your other copy must be R.  So you are Rr, a carrier for red hair.  You do not have red hair but you can pass it down to your kids.  Now on to your kids. Your husband can only pass an r down to your kids.  This means they will all have at least one r (and so will all be at least carriers for red hair).  As you can see below, each time you have a child, there is a 50% chance you will pass an R and a 50% chance you will pass an r.  Combining you and your husband, we get a 50% chance for Rr (r from dad, R from mom) and a 50% chance for rr (r from both parents).  So there is a 50% chance for a redhead (rr) and a 50% chance for a child without red hair (Rr).    See, that wasn’t so hard!  We were saved by the fact that you had a red haired parent.  As we talk about in our previous answer , if you hadn’t, things would have got a lot more complicated very quickly.  One last point.  Just because each of your kids has a 50% chance for red hair, that does not mean half your kids will.  If you had four kids, they could all have red hair, none of them could, or you could have some combination of kids with and without red hair.  It all has to do with what copy of the MC1R gene you passed on with each pregnancy.  Remember, the copy is chosen at random and what came before doesn’t affect what comes after.  If you had three redheads, your chances for a redhead in the next pregnancy would still be 50%.  Because your chances for passing an r are still 50%.  This is sort of like flipping a coin.  Just because you get heads, that does not affect the next flip.  There is still a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  Just like your MC1R versions!

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

These are external links and will open in a new window   Close share panel                  About 200 people took part in the UK's first Ginger Pride march in August, and the world record for the largest gathering of natural redheads was broken last month when 1,600 attended the Redhead Day Festival in the Dutch town of Breda. But how many redheads are there in the world - and where do they live? Scotland is thought by some to have the highest concentration of redheads in the world, so maybe it was an appropriate location for the Ginger Pride march, led by Canadian comedian Shawn Hitchins. While they marched through the streets of Edinburgh, he made a startling claim. "It's a great opportunity to bring together all the redheads in the country that holds 19% of the world's population of redheads," he told BBC Radio . The claim was initially reported on BBC News too. But can it really be true that Scotland is home to almost a fifth of the world's redheads?     "I can't really believe that figure," says Jonathan Rees, professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh and one of a team of scientists to identify the gene responsible for red hair - the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) .  We don't have very detailed information about the frequency of people with red hair Jonathan Rees   So where did Hitchins get the figure from? It turns out it was a mistake. "It must have been in confusion," he says. "I was walking through Edinburgh with 200 redheads behind me and I was mostly trying not to lead people into traffic. Nobody really knows the exact [number]. There was someone from Glasgow saying it was 19% in just the population of Scotland." In the heat of the moment, it seems, he simply got his words muddled, and that proportion of redheads in Scotland became something very different. "I am very sorry. This is what happens when you let comedians be spokespeople," says Hitchins. "Also, I'm a ginger so I'm 10 times more likely to make up a statistic."      Image caption  Shawn Hitchins at the Edinburgh Ginger Pride march   So if we can now confidently say that a fifth of the world's redheads do not live in Scotland, do we know what proportion actually do? "It's fair to say we don't have very detailed information about what the frequency of people with red hair is throughout the world," says Rees.  More or Less: Behind the stats  Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast  Download the More or Less podcast  More stories from More or Less  "I wouldn't say there are no reliable estimates, but the ideal way to do this would of course be like the census, where everybody's examined at various ages and you have robust data. "We don't have that sort of data, but many different researchers have carried out smaller studies where the selection has not been entirely random in the way you would like." It is often said that between 1% and 2%, or 70 to 140 million people around the world, have red hair. In purely numerical terms, it is highly likely that the US has the highest number of people with red hair, because of the size of its population. If just 1% had red hair, for example, that would mean it had three million redheads.      Image caption  US actress Julianne Moore with fellow redheads   According to Rees, the figure for the UK is about 10%. If that was the case in Scotland, that would suggest that the country with its population of 5.3 million was home to just over half a million redheads - less than 1% of the global total. The prevalence of red hair may be slightly higher in Scotland than in England, Rees says, adding that it may be even higher in the Republic of Ireland. Overall, Northern European countries have a greater proportion of redheads than anywhere else in the world.  More on gingers from the Magazine  Do they really want to seek out those with similar colouring? The Magazine's Clare Spencer went to Breda's Red Hair Day in 2009 .  "I think redheads do enjoy being together and not being the odd one out," said Alan Petrie, of Aberdeen.  Civil servant Anneloes Rynders  prefers being unusual: "In my youth it wasn't nice to be different. It changed about the age of 16 or 17. I got more confidence, I went out and got attention because I'm a redhead."  But she is disappointed that none of her children has ginger hair.  Is gingerism as bad as racism?       "If you're in northern Europe, you get used to seeing people with different hair colour," says Rees. "But most of the people on this planet don't live in Europe and if you just think about Asia, it's very, very rare to see somebody with red hair. And in most of Africa it is exceedingly rare to see somebody with red hair. It is an unusual trait globally." To explain this, you have to go back tens of thousands of years, says Rees. "When humans moved out of Africa… skin lightened and people developed hair with different colours. There seems to be some advantage in having pale skin if you live in parts of the world where there isn't much sunshine," he says. "The probable reason for that is that we make vitamin D in our skin. We rely on sunshine to make vitamin D and if you have very dark skin, it's harder to make that vitamin D." Being pale, redheads are more efficient at making vitamin D and do not need so much sunlight in order to get the amount they need, he says. So, in certain places in the world at least, there's a big advantage to being in this minority.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I am pregnant and I was curious on the probability that our son will have red hair. My husband has bright red hair, and so did his mom. My grandmother, father and all my aunts and great grandmother had fire red hair while young. I have brownish-red hair. I would just like to know what our odds are.        -A curious adult from South Carolina   November 14, 2012  Usually these questions are tough to answer but not this time.  You (and I) are lucky enough to have all the right pieces in place to answer the question.  Because your husband and your dad have red hair, I can say pretty confidently that each of your kids has around a 50% chance for red hair.  This is so easy to figure out because we can figure out what red hair genes you and your husband have.  As I’ll show below, with that information in hand, figuring out your kids’ chances is a snap.  And this kind of analysis isn’t restricted to just red hair.  What I talk about here will work for blue eyes, green eyes, O blood type and any other simple recessive traits.  What I’ll do for the rest of the answer is show how I came up with the 50% number.  It has to do with the fact that we get one copy of each of our genes from each parent and that some traits can stay hidden.   Crouching Traits, Hidden Versions  Genes are pieces of DNA that each have the instructions for one small part of you.  So there is a gene that determines whether or not you’ll have brown eyes, another that determines green eyes, still another that determines whether or not you’ll have red hair and so on for each of your other 20,000 or so genes.  It is the red hair gene we are obviously interested in here.  The key gene involved in red hair is called MC1R.  It comes in two versions that we will call not-red and red.  For reasons that I’ll explain in a bit, I’ll call the not-red version R and the red version r.  We all have two sets of most of our genes--one set from mom and the other from dad.  This means we have two copies of the MC1R gene too.  So we have two copies of the MC1R gene and it comes in two versions.  Here are the three possible combinations of MC1R genes:    Remembering that R means not red and r means red, two of these three combinations are easy to figure out.  RR would mean not red and rr would mean red.  But what about Rr?  Turns out Rr almost never has red hair (although they can have red highlights).  This is because the R version of the MC1R gene is dominant over the recessive r version.  R beats out r and so an Rr person does not have red hair.  (In genetics, a capital letter means the dominant or winning version and a lower case letter means the recessive version.)  With this information, we can fill in our table like so:    We need just one more bit of information to figure out the chances that your kids will have red hair.  That final piece is that when we have kids, we pass just one of our copies down.  And that this copy is chosen at random. (Well, I guess there were two bits of information!)  So for example, an Rr person has a 50% chance of passing down an R and a 50% chance of passing down an r each time he or she has a child.  This is where your 50% comes from.   Figuring You Out  Now we are ready to figure out you and your husband’s genes.  From that, we can figure out your chances for having a redhead.  Let’s do the easy one first—your husband.  Since he has red hair, odds are he has two copies of the red version of the MC1R gene.  He is rr.  We can figure out your genes because of your father.  Since he is a redhead, he is rr.  What that means for you is that he had to pass you an r…that is all he had to give.  So we know you have at least one r.  But since you don’t have red hair, your other copy must be R.  So you are Rr, a carrier for red hair.  You do not have red hair but you can pass it down to your kids.  Now on to your kids. Your husband can only pass an r down to your kids.  This means they will all have at least one r (and so will all be at least carriers for red hair).  As you can see below, each time you have a child, there is a 50% chance you will pass an R and a 50% chance you will pass an r.  Combining you and your husband, we get a 50% chance for Rr (r from dad, R from mom) and a 50% chance for rr (r from both parents).  So there is a 50% chance for a redhead (rr) and a 50% chance for a child without red hair (Rr).    See, that wasn’t so hard!  We were saved by the fact that you had a red haired parent.  As we talk about in our previous answer , if you hadn’t, things would have got a lot more complicated very quickly.  One last point.  Just because each of your kids has a 50% chance for red hair, that does not mean half your kids will.  If you had four kids, they could all have red hair, none of them could, or you could have some combination of kids with and without red hair.  It all has to do with what copy of the MC1R gene you passed on with each pregnancy.  Remember, the copy is chosen at random and what came before doesn’t affect what comes after.  If you had three redheads, your chances for a redhead in the next pregnancy would still be 50%.  Because your chances for passing an r are still 50%.  This is sort of like flipping a coin.  Just because you get heads, that does not affect the next flip.  There is still a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  Just like your MC1R versions!

By: Rosemary O. Fernandez Around this time last year, I got the best news of my life: My husband and I were expecting a baby! We kept it to ourselves for a while, but soon told our family and friends. As I inevitably expanded, I was asked the inevitable question: Will the little one have red hair too? This was a perfectly reasonable question as I was born with screaming red hair –the kind of shade that has prompted numerous strangers to tell me I have the map of Ireland written on my face despite the fact that I’m mostly Italian. I inherited these locks from my (Italian) mother, and my husband’s mother and grandfather are also gingers. Needless to say, the odds were in the little guy’s favor. Thirty-eight weeks slugged by, and I’d estimate that I heard the question about three times a week. Coworkers joked about it. Family members hoped for it. Random people at the grocery store thought it would be terrific. Naturally all my husband and I prayed for was a healthy child. Whether he popped out with red, blonde, brown, or green hair, we’d cuddle and dote on him just the same. But I’d be lying if I said I never crossed my fingers and daydreamed about strolling down the street with a fiery-headed toddler in tow. Here are some facts to see if  you will have a redhead baby: 1. In order for a baby to have red hair, both parents have to carry the gene, since it’s a recessive trait. So if you’re a ginger and you marry a ginger, odds are, your kids will be gingers, too. If only one parent has the locks but the other is a carrier, the baby’s chances are 50/50. If neither of you are red but you both are carriers, you have a one in four chance of a fiery-haired child. And, sorry to say, if only one parent is not a carrier (even though the other is), you’ve got no shot. [ Source ] 2. Even though you might not be a redhead yourself, studies estimate that 25 percent of Caucasian Americans carry the ginger gene, so if you fall into this category you might end up with a redheaded baby when you’re least expecting it. [ Source ] READ: 10 Things To Know If You’re a Redhead Baby My reasons weren’t purely aesthetic, because for me, my hair color is a huge part of my personality. I’m confident. I’m intelligent. I’m friendly. I’m funny (though my husband says it’s usually when I don’t mean to be). Growing up, my hair helped me cultivate these qualities. I’m used to strangers addressing me simply because they want to pay me a compliment about my hair; therefore I have no problem doing the same to someone else when I like their outfit or a speech they presented. On the first day of school when teachers called my name, they also told me they liked my hair; hence I became comfortable in a classroom from an early age, absorbed more information, and was never too timid to raise my hand when I knew the answer. I’m often the only redheaded in my group of friends, so I developed a good sense of direction; since I’m the most easily spotted in a crowd, my pals often followed me when we were out. Here are some other fun facts about redheads in general: Enjoy those baby blues while they last. The world’s rarest hair and eye color combo is red hair and blue eyes.

READ: Facts About Redheads That May Surprise You I want all this and more for my child. More than I want to dress him in t-shirts that have fun redheaded slogans, I want him to be confident. I want him to know he’s smart. I want him to not be afraid to be kind. Though hair color doesn’t determine these qualities, I know from experience that it helps. Sixteen weeks after birth, what’s the verdict? The jury’s still out. The baby was born with dark hair. Those strands have now mostly fallen out, and it looks like some red is replacing it. Only time will tell. But I still have my fingers crossed. Rock it like a Redhead!

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive . Read More: 4 Ways Medical Conditions Can Change Your Hairstyle More Likely to To Be Left-Handed There is limited scientific research regarding being a redhead and a "lefty," but it seems to be common. Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

By Marc Lallanilla, Life's Little Mysteries Assistant Editor | January 28, 2013 11:19am ET                            MORE           The redhead gene is recessive and can skip several generations.  Credit: Thaiview | Shutterstock     Some parents worry that their children will be born with a rare disease or a hidden genetic disorder. Other parents, however, wonder if their children will possess something more obvious: red hair.  A British ancestry company, BritainsDNA, is now offering parents the chance to see if their children might inherit the so-called "ginger gene," the Telegraph reports . The test will scan each parent's DNA for signs of the so-called MC1R gene that causes redheadedness.  "Through a simple saliva test to determine deep ancestry, we can … identify whether an individual is a carrier of any of the three common redhead variants in the gene MC1R," said Dr. Jim Wilson, chief scientist at BritainsDNA, as quoted in the Huffington Post .  The gene for red hair is recessive, so a person needs two copies of that gene for it to show up or be expressed. That means even if both parents carry the gene, just one in four of their children are likely to turn out to be a redhead. As a result, families that have no redheads for decades can suddenly discover a carrottop in their midst.  "Families can carry a variant for generations, and when one carrier has children with another carrier, a redheaded baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere." Wilson said, as quoted in the Daily Mail .  Though there's no scientific evidence that redheads deserve their reputation for having fiery temperaments, some recent reports suggest having red hair is associated with a number of health issues. A study from the journal Nature found that the pigment pheomelanin, which is responsible for red hair, may also make redheads even more susceptible to melanoma than fair-skinned blondes, according to the Los Angeles Times .  And a widely reported study from the Journal of the American Dentistry Association found that redheads are more sensitive to pain and require extra anesthesia during surgery, according to ABC News .  But there may be some advantages to having red hair, too, EverydayHealth.com reports. The pale skin that redheads usually have is more efficient at soaking up sunlight — and sunlight is required for the body to manufacture vitamin D , an essential nutrient.  Worldwide, red hair is quite rare, and just over 0.5 percent, or one in 200 people, are redheads — this amounts to almost 40 million people, the Daily Mail reports.  In Ireland, an estimated 10 percent of the population has red hair, though about 40 percent of the Irish carry the recessive gene. In Scotland and England, 13 percent and 6 percent, respectively, are redheaded, according to the Daily Mail.  The DNA test will be offered by BritainsDNA at a genealogy and ancestry exhibition named Who Do You Think You Are , associated with the popular NBC television show and scheduled to be held in London next month.

Both my parents have brown hair, so it seems strange that I have ginger hair. What is the likelihood of our children having ginger hair? No-one else as far as I know in my family or my partner's family has ginger hair either.  Chloe Jakes, Blandford, UK   What colour hair did the milkman have? Paul Turner, Toronto, Canada    Hair colour is determined by the genetic make up of your parents and grandparents and great grandparents etc...
Every generation will carry the ginger gene, though in your families recent history (until you were born) the gene was recessive, hence your parents and grandparents didn't have ginger hair.
There's around 25% chance that your children will have ginger hair. the calculation works like this:
There are 2 hair colours that you'll pass to your children black (b) and ginger (g)
If we mix those colours and assume that the ginger gene is recessive i.e. it will always be dominated by black the following results are available: bb bg gb gg
Ony the gg result would produce a ginger haired child. So your parents may have been a bg and a bg but both their hair colours were black, as it turned out you were the 1 in 4 gg, likewise your partner could carry the recessive ginger gene but she also has the black gene which is dominant. Andy Preston, Otley, UK    To have ginger hair, you must have received one copy of what is a recessive gene from each of your parents. They only had one copy each, since the other, dominant gene for brown hair colouring was being expressed in their case.
What this means is that all your children will receive one ginger hair gene from you and the likelihood of them having ginger hair will depend on what they receive from your partner. If, like your parents, your partner is carrying a single ginger hair gene along with a single brown hair one, then your children will have a 50/50 chance of having ginger hair. If your partner has no genes for ginger hair, then the chance is nil, and you will have to wait for grandchildren for another chance for your ginger hair to re-express itself. Ian Brown, Herne Hill, UK    One theory used to be that red hair was a recessive condition: ie that both your parents carried a gene for red hair while also having one for dark hair. The "dark-haired" gene would have been dominant, giving them the dark-hair phenotype. If both of them happened to pass on the red-haired gene to you, you'd have both the phenotype and genotype for red hair. With regards to you and your husband having a red-haired offspring, we'd have to guess whether he's a carrier for the red-hair gene. Gerry Dunlop, Zeal Monachorum, Crediton, UK    I would sit your mother down and have a frank discussion about her prior relationship with the milkman. Louise Vippond, Doha, Qatar    Andy Preston's calculation of a 1 in 4 chance relates to a future sibling of yours, not to a child. If your partner carries the gene for ginger hair, then there is a 1 in 2 chance that your child will have ginger hair. If he does not, then there is no chance.
To talk in general terms about "the likelihood" gets us into all sorts of problems about subjective probability. The fact that no-one in your partner's family has ginger hair means that he is less likely to carry the gene for ginger hair than an average person of his age, birth town, medical history, etc. Pelham Barton, Birmingham, UK    I do not know, but I wish you luck. Jonathan, Lancaster, England    I heard that neither of your parents need to have the gene for ginger hair and that it comes from a lack in Eumelanin James B, London, England    1 in 2 chance of your child being a redhead if your parter carries the ginger gene. Zero chance of you having a child with red hair if your partner does not carry the ginger gene. Indi, Glasgow, Scotland    My Mum's father had ginger hair. My Mum (his only child) had brown hair. I'm one of six kids, two of which have ginger hair.
Both of us ginger haired siblings have children.
Julian has Taylor,I have Ellis and Owen.
All three have ginger hair,despite our partners having brown hair.
Im ever so proud that we are going forth and multiplying. Rory Wilson, Watford England    Red hair is caused by a mutation of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene on chromosome 16. Most red heads have a mutation on both copies of this gene, however approximately 15% have the mutation on only one of the genes and typically have lighter red hair. So red hair is not a generic genetics problem you can solve with a simple punnet square. Ashleigh, Lexington USA    FYI for anyone who chances across this board in the future... I KNOW red hair does not work like they teach it in school. I know it is possible to have red hair even if you only have one parent with the gene. My dad's dad had blond hair, his mom had dark brown hair. My dad has brown and his sister had blond. My dad is either a Brown/blond or Brown/brown genotype. I have Irish Setter-like red hair as does my mom. I know there was no "milk man" because I otherwise look very much like my dad's family (more so than my mom's) including a chin cleft (another genetically inherited trait). My mom's red hair came to her similarly. Grandpa had black hair, grandma red. My mom's brothers have dark brown hair, so grandpa wasn't a red/Black and grandma wasn't a red/red. Red hair is co-dominant in cows maybe in people too. You might have a ginger child...some shade of red from strawberry to copper or auburn. Anne R, Santa Barbara USA    Wow im really worried about this i have ginger has as so as my grandmother and cusion but not my partner or his family do you think my children will have ginger hair???? Chloe Flaherty, stoke on trent uk    I am a ginger and proud of it! So much so that I pray my children will be gingers too! Johann Venter, Sasolburg South Africa    First of all I think it is very sad but also quite hilarious that people are 'worried' that their children will have red hair!!
However just to add to the previous answers, yes red hair is usually caused by a mutation in the MC1R gene which can be inherited. It is also the case that ANYONE can have a mutation of ANY gene so even someone with non-carrying parents can have red hair.
You might be better 'worrying' about future children being born with serious illnesses rather than red hair!

I have light brown hair and my husband has red hair. I want to know what the probability of having a child with red. Is it likely?  Ashley, Saratoga Springs United States   Very likely !
Red hair carries a far more dominant chromosome than brown hair. rebecca, bradford uk    This depends if you have a red hair gene stored in your DNA. We each have a pair of genes for any trait like hair color, one from each parent.
The one that takes precedent is the dominant gene. Red hair is a recessive gene, so your husband has two red hair genes. The only way for your child to have red hair is if you have a recessive red gene (being covered by the dominant brown hair gene) and that is the gene that gets passed onto the baby. Kayla Iacovino, Tempe, United States    To add to Kayla Iacovino's answer. If you don't have the recessive Red gene none of your offspring will have red hair but all of them will carry the red gene from their dad so red-headed grandchildren are on the cards. If you do have the recessive red gene then 1 in 4 of your children will be redheads. G. Baker, South Ockendon, UK    If it's lucky! Vivienne, London, UK    Actually the red hair gene is recessive to blonde and brown etc. You have two alleles, one from your mom and one from your dad. In your husbands case he has "Red"/"Red" and you could have "Brown"/"Brown", "Brown"/"Blonde", of "Brown"/"Red". If it is the first couple then your children CANNOT have red hair, impossible. However if you happen to have a recessive red hair gene perhaps from one of your parents who might have had it as well then there is a high chance. You give either a Brown or Red gene and your husband gives a Red or Red gene so I'd say a 50% in that case.
But probably 0% but as mentioned, watch out for grandchildren ;) two people who don't have red hair but carry the gene can have children who have red hair. Darren Bridgewater, Hartlepool England    Years and years ago, before my husband and I were married, or even going out together, he said to me jokingly one day, "We could never get married, because our kids would be redheads!" (I have darkish red hair, he had very dark reddish hair). As it turned out, we did get married and our three kids all do have red hair... all are, of course, gorgeous! No, really! In Ireland, there isn't the same awful "ginger" stigma that there is in England. Nurn, Galway    I have blonde/brown hair, and my husband has red hair. My first son has brown eyes and brown hair with a few surprsing RED hairs all over his head. Interesting huh?
I want to see grandchildren with red hair. Melanie, North Babylon USA    To correct a few errors above. If you are not carrying the red hair gene all your children will have a red hair gene from their father and a non-red one from you and so probably be non-red. Current knowledge suggests it is not a zero chance; there is at least one other, different but rare, gene that can give red hair, and there are red haired individuals who appear to have only a red/non-red genetic makeup.
On the other hand if you are a red hair carrier, so you have one red and one non-red gene, then each child will have essentially a 50% chance of having two red-hair genes. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the child will have red hair. The "red hair" gene actually comes in several version, some of which are incompletely expressed so they may only give red hair say 10% of the time. The reason for this is not known but probably involves interactions with other genes.
So what are the chances of carrying a red hair gene? Analysis of UK or UK origin populations finds that almost half the population are carriers of one or another red hair form of the gene, so you have a high chance of being a carrier.
I should also say that current data suggests that the gene or genes responsible for blonde versus non-blonde are different from the red non-red gene. Ian Jackson, Edinburgh UK    Why risk it? Alex, Derby, England    What do you mean 'why risk it'     Well first of all I wish I lived in Ireland! If they don't have the stigma of being a horrid "ginger" then I'm going!
I have dark red hair from parents with brown hair (and freckles). My brother has brown hair. I have 2 grandparents on each side who had red hair - hence it hiding in my parents, until they met and produced one brown haired baby and one (me) red head.
My boyfriend has also got red hair (but very pale) but his parents are both non-red heads. He doesn't know about his grandparents.
Will we have children with red hair 100%? It is everybody else's main concern! Melanie, London, UK    well...its look like you are talking about my case..:), my mother has light brown hair and my dad has red hair..i got the red hair as the first child but my youngest brother and sister has light brown hair. Reem, Jordan    This post is probably closed by now, I replied to it a long time ago.
I remember when I was a kid in the USA (long time ago), people (ok, women) used to stop me and ooh and aah after my hair colour and told me I was so lucky to have hair that colour.
They do the same now to my daughters now , in Ireland, where every well-to-do woman is now very blonde with an orangey tan; but not to my son, although his hair is more blondey-red.
Guess what, though? Hair colour doesn't guarantee you a happy life! Who'd have thought? Nurn, Galway Ireland    I have mousy brown hair and my boyfriend has ginger hair containing a mix of brown as well
We have two kids together, our first one has brown hair but when he is in the sun you can see the ginger colour on top and our second child also a boy has black hair but also same with him has the ginger colour on top when he's in the sun
But you cant ask for it, it just happens with the hair colour, you can say i want a ginger haired kid, you just have to wait and see really. jodie, united kingdom    My husband had blonde hair, I have darkish brown, and I had 4 children - one blonde one brown and two redheads, whoops did I get a ribbing!! mary durant, worthing west sussex    Genes are strange things...
I have ginger hair and light brown eyes and my sister has dark brown hair and light brown eyes also (our mum has black hair and brown eyes / dad has light brown hair and grey eyes. All grandparents were dark brown or black haired). My partner has dark brown hair and blue eyes (his mum has dark brown hair with brown eyes / his dad is dark brown hair and blue eyes).
Our daughter has blonde hair (no ginger tones at all) and green eyes.
My sister has 5 kids. Their father is half Chinese with black hair. All her kids have light brown hair but all have ginger tones/ highlights especially when they have been in the sun.

Besides the obvious similarity as heads-of-state, all three had red hair.  Hair color ranges from platinum blond to ebony, due to levels of pigments produced by specialized cells called melanocytes. Those with dark hair have cells that produce a pigment called eumelanin, and those with blond or red hair have cells that produce pheomelanin. The relative ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin determines a person’s hair color. A complete absence of both pigments leads to white hair color.  The gene responsible for determining hair color is called the Melanocortin 1 Receptor, or MC1R. If the MC1R gene is active, it produces eumelanin and a person will have darker skin and hair. If the MC1R gene does not function (i.e. it is blocked or inactivated), the melanocytes will produce pheomelanin instead of eumelanin. A person with a malfunctioning MC1R gene will have blond or red hair, due to the lack of eumelanin, along with freckles. MC1R gene mutations are seen in all ethnicities.   My husband and son carry MC1R polymorphisms, and display the red hair phenotype. | Source       MC1R Gene Location The MC1R gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16. Its official location is 16q24.3, and is 3,098 base pairs in length. Depending on the specific mutation (known as a polymorphism in the language of genetics), hair color will range from strawberry blond to auburn. The MC1R gene encodes a protein made up of 317 amino acids. Over 35 sites on the gene have been identified with polymorphisms, and only a small number of these mutations cause red hair shades.

Red hair is recessive, which means a person may have brown hair, and carry the “red gene” without expressing the hair color. A person must have two copies of the recessive gene to express the trait. The chances of having a child with red hair depend on the genes of the parents. For simplicity’s sake, the various polymorphisms in the MC1R gene will be called the “red hair gene.” The red hair gene will be labeled as a lowercase r in the charts below and brown hair will be labeled with an upper case R.   Case 1: Parents with Brown Hair In the first scenario, two parents have brown hair and do not carry any polymorphisms on the MC1R gene. In other words, neither of the parents is a carrier for the red hair gene. None of their children will have red hair, unless a new mutation arises spontaneously. These parents have almost no chance of having a child with red hair, unless a de novo mutation were to arise.         Case 2: Brown-Haired Carriers In the second scenario, both parents have brown hair, but carry a red-hair causing gene. These parents are both called “carriers” of the gene. In this case, the parents will have a 25% chance of having a child with brown hair who does not carry the red gene. They have a 50% chance of having a child with brown hair who carries the red gene. There is a 25% chance that the parents will have a child with red hair.     Case 3: Parents with Brown and Red Hair A third possibility involves a parent with red hair and a parent with brown hair. The parent with brown hair in this case is not a carrier of the red gene. Each of the children will have one allele for the red hair gene, and will be carriers of the gene. None of the children, however, will display the physical trait of having red hair.         Case 4: Parents with Brown Hair (Carrier) and Red Hair In a fourth scenario, one parent has red hair and the other has brown hair, but is a carrier of the red gene. There is a 50% chance that the children will have red hair, and a 50% chance that the children will be brown-haired carriers of the red gene.  This is the scenario in my own family: I have brown hair and probably do not carry red-causing MC1R polymorphisms. My husband, however, has the classic red hair phenotype. One of my sons is blond, and the other has strawberry blond hair.     Case 5: Parents with Red Hair The last case includes two parents with red hair: in this situation, all of the children would have the same phenotype as the parents. The children will all have red hair, since neither parent has the dominant "brown hair" MC1R genotype. In some cases, different polymorphisms (alleles) may be inherited from each parent. This scenario is common in locations where red hair is a common occurrence: primarily in Scotland and Ireland.         Genetic Mutation MC1R: Beyond Hair Color The MC1R gene is expressed in many cells, and is responsible for more than hair color. MC1R plays a role in inflammatory response, pain sensitivity, and the immune system. The far reaching effects of the MC1R gene are listed below:  Cancer risk  Redheads have an increased risk for melanoma, as the melanocytes in people with red hair do not produce the protective eumelanin pigment. Unfortunately, the risk of cancer is increased even when there is no exposure to sunlight , so those with red hair should have regular check-ups with a dermatologist to monitor any skin changes. It is important to note that people who have dark skin and MC1R mutations are also at risk for skin cancer.  Increased pain sensation  People who have red hair are more sensitive to pain caused by burns and freezing than people with brown hair. Studies performed by Edwin B. Liem at the National Institutes of Health demonstrated an increased sensation of pain caused by thermal changes, and an increased need for anesthetic. Redheads required 19% more anesthetic than their brown haired counterparts. Interestingly, those with red hair demonstrate a reduced sensitivity to stinging pain (the type of pain encountered when receiving an injection). The MC1R gene affects the binding of endorphins, which are the body’s natural painkillers.   Melanoma Risk in Europe A map showing the density of light-eyed people in Western Europe. Melanoma risk increases for those who produce less eumelanin. | Source   Famous Redheads Emily Dickinson, the American poet  Antonio Vivaldi, the Italian composer  Mark Twain, the American author  Malcolm X, civil rights activist  Cleopatra, Egyptian ruler  Vladimir Lenin, Russian revolutionary    Red Hair Stereotypes and Beliefs The most common modern stereotype about redheads is that red hair comes with a fiery, feisty personality. Earlier in history, redheads faced more dangerous beliefs about their red hair. In ancient Egypt, redheads were burned alive as a sacrifice to the god Osiris. Their ashes were blown over agricultural fields by winnowing fans and used as fertilizer for the season’s crops. Early Egyptians regarded red hair as an unlucky trait.  In the middle ages, those with red hair could be labeled as witches or vampires. The Malleus Maleficarum (a report on witches in the Middle Ages) states, “Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires.”       Other Causes of Red Hair Some people do not come by their red hair via the MC1R gene. One type of albinism (type 3, or rufous albinism) demonstrates a phenotype of red hair and ruddy skin. This form of albinism is most common in New Guinea and Africa.  Severe malnutrition can lead to a condition known as kwashiorkor – the deprivation of protein and calories from an individual’s diet will lead to failure to thrive, edema, excessive hair growth, and depigmentation, along with the development of red hair. The Biblical story of Esau is fascinating in this regard, because the Bible describes Esau as covered in red hair. As the story goes, Esau sold his birthright as the first-born son to his younger twin, in exchange for a bowl of soup. While the story is intended to demonstrate the hazards of placing material desires over a spiritual blessing, one has to wonder if Esau was simply suffering from the effects of kwashiorkor.  Proopiomelanocortin deficiency (POMC) is a genetic disease resulting in obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair . Children with this genetic disorder exhibit early onset severe obesity and striking red hair, due to the effects the POMC gene has on ACTH production and the influence this gene has on the phaeomelanin:eumelanin ratio in cells.   Redhead Nicknames There are various nicknames used around the world for those who have red hair. Sometimes the nicknames are affectionate, but many of the nicknames are used as insults.  Ranga: An Australian nickname for people with red hair. The word is a shortened version of the word orangutan.  Ginger: A name used for redheads, most commonly used in the U.K. The cartoon series South Park satirized the persecution of redheads with a genocidal campaign against "ginger people."  Carrot Top: A nickname often used in the United States, comparing red hair to the color of carrots.  Koakage: The Japanese word for redheads - the word "akage" indicates the red hair and the prefix "ko" for something small or cute.    The Myth of Redhead Extinction News reports reported on the imminent extinction of redheads in August 2007 . Like many other myths circulating on the internet, the reports were incorrect. Based on the incorrect assumption that recessive genes will "die out" over time, the news reports stated that the gene for red hair would be gone by the year 2060. The reports supposedly came from the Oxford Hair Foundation, but no such scientific entity exists. The Oxford Hair Foundation manufactures beauty products and is not an academic facility. The claim that redheads are going extinct is completely false: recessive genes may become rare, but will not disappear from the human genome. Red hair will exist well beyond the year 2060!

Author Leah Lefler 11 days ago  from Western New York I would love to travel to Alaska one day, Lone Timberwolf. We also live in a low-sun location during the winter (Western NY), but our summers are sunny and typically are in the mid 80's. I have to stay on top of the sunscreen for my children, as their skin is very prone to sunburn. Your hair is beautiful!  Author Leah Lefler 11 days ago  from Western New York Hair color for people with blonde or red hair often darkens with age, as certain genes are switched off and on throughout childhood and puberty. Eumelanin production typically increases with age.  LoneTimberWolf 11 days ago  Aye, livin' in Alaska was a low sun environment during th' winter. but what most don't seem to realize is that it gets into the 90's during th' summer. And thank ye my friends also think My hair and eye combination is quite pretty as well. My profile picture is actually a picture of me, not something I  found on the internet.  shreyash11 11 days ago  will my hair colour get darker as... age by age ??  Author Leah Lefler 12 days ago  from Western New York Shreyash, you could always have your hair dyed to a darker color if you would like to do so.  shreyash11 13 days ago  I am redhead..my hair colour is getting partially dark brown...then What should i do for to make my hair colour darkest brown ..??  Author Leah Lefler 2 weeks ago  from Western New York Shreyash11, it is impossible to say with certainty, but your baby will most likely demonstrate the phenotype of dark hair if you marry someone with dark hair. The child may or may not have the mutations responsible for red hair, but it is likely to be masked by the darker hair. Genetics is tricky to predict (due to crossing-over during meiosis and other intricacies), so you never really know until the child is born.  Author Leah Lefler 2 weeks ago  from Western New York Your parents likely each carry MC1R genetic mutations, Madison - I bet your hair is beautiful! I have brown hair, my husband had very red hair (it is now much darker and appears brown) and my son has strawberry blonde hair that is getting darker with age.  Madison 2 weeks ago  I have red hair and my parents have black and brown hair  shreyash11 2 weeks ago  I am redhead boy...but my parants have typically black hair & if i marry with black hair colourd girl then which hair colour will my baby have ???      Author Leah Lefler 5 weeks ago  from Western New York What a cool combination of rare eye and hair color, Lone Timberwolf! Living in Alaska would definitely be a low-sun environment. We live in Western NY and do not get very much sun, and my pale, red (now brown) haired child does well in the low-sun environment.  LoneTimberWolf 5 weeks ago  I have bright red hair, as does my da, aunt, grandma, and great grandma. We all have the MC1R mutation, and my mother is a carrier, but she had blonde hair and brown eyes. I somehow got amber eyes, though my mom and sisters eyes are brown, and my da's are green. I can tan, with much effort and many sunburn, but I am most comfortable in cold climates with little sun, such as when I lives in alaska. So I got one of the rarest eye colors in the world, and the rarest hair color as well. ^-^  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York Laura, I wanted to add the OTC 23 and Me test only tests for three variants on the MC1R gene. Well over 30 variants are known to cause the red-hair phenotype, so it is quite possible you have a variant not tested by the kit.  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York Hello, Laura - 23 and Me is an over the counter test. If you can buy it online, it is over-the-counter. To have full sequencing of the MC1R gene, you would need a prescription and the oversight of a geneticist. 23 and Me (along with other OTC genetics kits) only look for the most common allele or mutation in most genes.  Laura 2 months ago  Thanks for the reply Leah. It wasnt an over the counter test, i used the 23 and me testing which covers all of them in detail.  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York Hi Laura - there are over 30 different alleles for MC1R, and it is likely that any over the counter genetic testing product only tests for the most common variants. The most likely explanation is that you do have a variant in the MC1R gene that wasn't detected by the test, as most OTC evaluations are produced to find the most common alleles. Another explanation would be that you carry another gene (other than MC1R) that is affecting hair color, though nearly all people with red hair carry a mutation in the MC1R gene. Other genes are suspected of playing a role in hair and skin pigmentation, however, so genetics is a bit more complicated than a Punnett square might suggest.  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York It is quite possible you either carry or have the gene, philessense. The only way to tell for sure would be genetic testing.  philessense 2 months ago  Mother and 3 sibs are redheads. Father, dark brown w/ blue eyes, fair skin never tanned. Eldest brother and I brown hair with red in it if I try to go blonde. My redheaded sibs consider me dark, as I am able, with much effort, to build a bit of a tan and they can't. But I'm quite pale, burn and blister more easily than normal people. And when I am at my darkest, people tell me I am too pale. I have always assumed I had the red hair gene.  Laura 2 months ago  Hi. I’ve just had genetic testing done and i do not carry the red hair gene. I have dark brown hair. However my partner has red hair and so do both of my children. I thought both parents had to have the gene?      Author Leah Lefler 3 months ago  from Western New York It is so interesting to see the variations in expression with the red-hair gene, Leslie! My children are similar (my husband is a red-head and my oldest is dark blond and my youngest is strawberry blond).  Leslie Yee 3 months ago  My husband is a red head rr (2 recessive red), I am brunette Bb (1 dominant brown, 1 recessive blonde). We have 2 brunette daughters, and one dark blonde daughter. All daughters have one recessive red hair gene.  Catherine Dye 3 months ago  What are the possible hair color types for a child born to one red haired parent and one brunette parent who carries a recessive blonde hair gene? Would it be 50% brunette with a recessive red and 50% strawberry blonde? or would the other 50% just turn out red? What happens when two different colored recessive genes pair up?  Author Leah Lefler 4 months ago  from Western New York I wouldn't be scared, Bree, but I would be careful with regard to tanning and excessive sun exposure. My boys are very fair and we use sunscreen with them whenever they are outside for extended periods (my 11 year old had a scare with a dysplastic mole that showed up on his back at the age of 9 and recurred, so he had to have a wide excision to remove all chance that it could come back). Everyone is different and the only real worry with having both copies of MC1R would be repeated exposure to the sun, increasing the risk of skin cancer. I'm sure you'll be fine as long as you don't sunbathe on a regular basis!  Bree 4 months ago  Im kinda scared after reading that redheads and blonde haired people are likely carriers of cancerous genes. Im the only red head in my blood related family and also the only girl who was born into my family, making me "special" so I hope there is nothing else different. Also, does anyone with medical knowledge know the percentage of red/blonde haired people that have came down with cancer is? Also, does anyone know what age it usually comes by if it is a Dominant gene?  Author Leah Lefler 5 months ago  from Western New York The MC1R genetic mutation is carried by all races, tlew. It is also likely Cleopatra used henna as a beauty agent.  tlew 5 months ago  how was malcom x a redhead? or cleopatra?  Author Leah Lefler 5 months ago  from Western New York It is highly likely you carry the MC1R gene, RTaylor, though only genetic testing would be definitive. My husband has similar traits and we have one child with strawberry hair (which has darkened) and one child with blond hair. Your parents may or may not have red hair, as each one would only need to be a carrier to pass on the red trait, so you could have two parents who don't display the trait. My son and I both have issues with anesthesia, though we also have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (known for a difficulty with anesthesia), so it is hard to determine whether it is the EDS or the red hair gene causing the issues for us!  RTaylor 5 months ago  Fascinating!!  I'm curious and would like some feedback if anyone cares to assume the challenge? I'm adopted,  thus I have zero genetic history that I can share.  However, after reading all the posts, I feel somewhat confident in proclaiming that I am a "True Red" based on the following: 1) red-headed since birth, (various degrees of darkness, but always red) 2) green eyes and sensitive to sunlight 3) heavy freckling but not necessarily "pale-skinned" More "ruddy" looking. I do burn easily and my freckles seem to double if I forget sunscreen. Also have had 3 lesions removed...not melanoma,  but did have some type of cancerous cells. 4) Dx'd with SLE (systemic Lupus) at age 40. It's an auto-immune disorder that causes an increased inflammatory response. 5) This one is the worst by far...on 2 seperate occasions, I woke up during surgery!! I didn't feel pain, but I remember opening my eyes through some kind of guppy lubricant they apply apparently, and thinking...Oh s#!:#!  That's all I remember thank God...the anesthesiologist later explained to me that it was because of my "red-hair gene!" 6) For some weird reason, my body wont dissolve those "dissolvable stitches." Nobody seems to know why? I'm now wondering if this an isolated occurance, or could it be related to the gene? Ok....here's my question?  Is it reasonable to assume that I'm a carrier of the MC1R gene? Husband- brown hair, light green eyes, tans easily. Both my children have dark brown hair with heavy red tints in sunlight. Both light BLUE -eyed, scattered freckles to upper body only. Both O-neg blood type...same as me. Neither have shown evidence of problems with anesthesia thus far. 2nd question (sorry!) Any ideas on what my bio-parents had in terms of hair/eye color?? Thanks for any insight you might be willing to share. It's nice to know I'm not the only one with questions!! Best to you all....  Author Leah Lefler 5 months ago  from Western New York My son is similar, Yadira - he was born with black hair, which fell out and he had red hair until it darkened to brown. We are much farther north than Florida - but his eyes are blue/gray.  Yadira 5 months ago  Oh, I am a mess. I was born with black hair, then it turned lighter almost blond then copperish red, then red(er) and finally dark brown. I got out in the sun and I turn red, earn freckles and go back to be white again. I never get a tan (Sighs) My eyes they can change from blue to gree all in one day or stay green for many years and change into different shades of green. If I travel a bit far up north in the state of Florida where I am and the weather is cold my eyes turn blue.  Author Leah Lefler 6 months ago  from Western New York Hi Jim, is the "red spot" a patch of red hair, or is it a red spot on the skin? Red spots on the skin (macules, papules, and hemangiomas) are not indicative of carrying the recessive red hair gene. If you have a patch of red hair, then you may carry/express the recessive MC1R gene.  Jim 6 months ago  If I have a red spot on the back of my head do I carry recessive red?  Author Leah Lefler 6 months ago  from Western New York The red hair gene exists in many ethnicities, so it is not linked to "green eyes," though there are people who carry both traits at the same time. There is likely a founder effect as many of these traits (Rh negative blood type, green eyes, and red hair) are found at a higher rate in Europe and occur simultaneously in many individuals.  susan sanger 6 months ago  Interesting.  Have you cross-matched red hair, eye color, skin color? So far, the conclusions are very different:  Red hair, green eyes, extreme sensitivity to hot- cold., and RH Negative blood type?  grandma clara  Author Leah Lefler 7 months ago  from Western New York It is interesting, Matthew. We actually had a fertile mule in the Inland Empire of California where I spent my childhood. She had two foals - they named one of the foals "Blue Moon" due to the rarity of a fertile mule!  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  ( http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnews360.c... ) I made a an ignorant claim that, Hybrid Species are "genetic dead ends", this is an article from Wire reprinted from Quanta Magazine, that illustrates the benefit of diversity, and that being a pseudo-scientist is being wrong a lot! lol.  ( Im not sure if linking is allowed, article was found in a aggregator )  Author Leah Lefler 7 months ago  from Western New York I agree, Matthew, that people seem to have become polarized in recent times and we must reach out to our fellow humans to stop hate and to develop relationships that prevent the formation of stereotypes. Never stop learning - this should be the human motto.  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  While trying to find evidence to my argument, i ran across "Christian Forums" really getting disgusting and it just highlighted how stupid today's world is because we as a society are okay with being fed information rather then winning that information for our own good. Ignorance is the bane of Civilization, once we are complacent enough to believe what sounds good we are ignorant enough to vote out our republic.  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  (Bio: I'm a US Army Infantryman, all outsides look the same when they are on the outside, and if we can eliminate hate,fear, and ignorance, then what is there left to fight over, If I can never see Death again due  to misunderstandings I will die happy)Thank you, Preconceived Notions. that was what I was trying to say. Long story short My buddy was telling me he was attracted to Red's, even though he "was" and "we are" supposed to be "disgusted by them," thats when I forgot myself and yelled "conjecture!!!, that's not science nor is it fact, It!! is based on hate stereotypes", and Preconceived notions.  In an attempt to try to correct, in what I believe a intellectual teachable moment and a literal chance to "kill" hate and ignorance, because he rebutted my argument in I believe her because she is in the medical field, even though she has not specialized nor is she a Phd. I'm like awesome, I can prove to you! or.. reference to the fact that is not common knowledge nor is it scientific. Not to mention He could talk to a Herpetologist about his hemorrhoids, but unless He has a cloaca his advice should be taken with understanding that Dr. Herp DVM. is not an expert in that field or discipline and neither is the "Expert".  Author Leah Lefler 7 months ago  from Western New York Matthew, I would first ask the question: is your initial supposition correct? Who finds red-heads unattractive?  Apart from a satirical South Park episode, I haven't heard about hate groups regarding people with red hair, though I suppose there are people who will always find someone to hate. As with all physical characteristics, there are stereotypes applied - which are often inaccurate or serve to validate a preconceived notion. Prejudice is learned and not a genetic trait.  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  I'm, looking for information about how the "fear of gingers" propagates anecdotal conjecture. The argument: my friend said according to his Niece who purportedly works at John Hopkins for Kids, "We are genetically designed to find red-heads unattractive." My rebuttal: CONJECTURE, more specific Religious Allegory, most recently Vikings dominating Christians from the Dark Ages up until the Late Middle Ages, even surviving the renaissance as the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire. We were taught to Hate and Fear Red  headed pagans, and those fears survive today as stereotypes. I have tried arguing that Hate is a subjective sociological skill, one learns to conform to to be accepted and not be cast out of the "Common People" with the "Common Idea". I tried to bring up Bears, and highlight the difference between biological response to environment and sociological response to society's common idea.  Bears evolved white fur to better hunt on the Ice, those who lived long enough to pass that mutation now propagates the mutation as a dominant, and now the likelihoods of creating white furred hunters are more likely, and a probability. Where does Social come into play? Wolves adopt dogs, Cats adopt Birds. but because they cannot reproduce, in my mind it doesn't apply; Polar Bear and Grizzly Bear are probably close enough to get a mutant like Liger or a Walfin, or a mule, but that line stops as mutants are usually born sterile. Since all Humans possess the MC1R Gene and it can be expressed by any human, and if we are programmed to hate Ginger's, then why don't we hate ourselves for being carriers? Anyone? I'm open minded so critique that crap out of me.  Author Leah Lefler 8 months ago  from Western New York There are a lot of variants, Mickie! Many people with the "red" gene don't display the phenotype if they also have dark hair, but may easily have children with lighter hair where the redness shows through. My husband was a true red-head, but became darker as an adult. He still has a red beard! My oldest boy was blond as a baby, but my youngest son had strawberry blond hair.

I am the oldest of three -- I have Strawberry Blonde and green eyes, my two bothers were medium brown hair and brown eyes. Not sure of my Dad's side way back, but the immediate family all had shades of brown hair and some with brown eyes and others blue or green.  My mom's side however, had lots of red hair.  My husband's hair is dark brown/black and brown eyes.  My son had Strawberry Blonde when little, but it turned darker, and darker brown as he got older, but he has a reddish brown beard!  Justin Hall 9 months ago  This is bizarre. I have the following alleles with regard to my MC1R gene R160W, D294H, V92M, D84E, V60L and yet I have brown hair. I had blond hair as a child and by the time I was in my mid teens it had darkened to the medium light to medium brown it is today. All I have ever found was an occasional red hair in my beard and even they were few and far in between.  Hernan 10 months ago  Red hair, as any recessive mutation can be diluted (if they reproduce at slower speed than the other hair color populations) but not extinct unless there is a pressure to supress this mutation by selection (Suppression of these people from reproduction). Maybe the % of gingers can be reduced but not eliminated.  kayeff 11 months ago  Did you just make up the "koakage" because I can't find evidence of it's truth anywhere. Akage = redhead and kawaii = cute. Where did you get the koakage idea?  Author Leah Lefler 13 months ago  from Western New York Blond hair may contain pheomelanin, Keep It Red - it does not have to contain this form of melanin, but it certainly can have it.  Author Leah Lefler 13 months ago  from Western New York It is very interesting to me how the beard color will remain red, even when the hair on someone's head has darkened, sbbhunt! My husband still has a very red beard, even though the hair on his head has turned a reddish brown color.  Author Leah Lefler 13 months ago  from Western New York My younger son had red hair as a toddler and it is now darker and nearly the same color as his older brother's hair (a very dark blond/light brown). It is interesting how hair color changes over time, Robert! My family ancestry is largely Irish and my husband's is British/German - my husband had very red hair.  roberttracy70@yahoo.com 13 months ago  My fathers hair was white  eyes blue when he was young , changing to nut brown later. we 3 childern all had very fair hair , changing later to brown .

Sbbhunt 14 months ago  Why did you not mention black and red, my father had blue black hair, so does my oldest brother, one of my brother has brown hair, 3 of us original blond, the men with red beard. My mother had red hair, my daughter was born red hair but turn into very blond  jhert 15 months ago  I have a question hopefully someone can help me answer... My mom has red hair (not auburn) and my dad has brown hair. I have blonde hair and my brother has red hair (slightly more blonde than my moms). How is this possible? I understand how my brother would have gotten his red hair if my dad is carrying a mc1r gene but how would I have blonde hair then? Could my dad be carrying a brown hair, blonde hair and mc1r gene?  keep it red 17 months ago  Okay.  I've been reading and I'm not so sure what I typed a week ago is correct because now I'm finding publications that are saying that pheomelanin IS responsible for blonde hair as well.  Some say yes, some say no.  I would like to know the truth so I'll keep reading.  My apologies to you and again, thanks for the article.  keep it red 17 months ago  Enjoyed this article with the exception of one glaring mistake.  Blonde hair does not cotain pheomelanin, only a bit of eumelanin.  As you stated above, the abscence of any pigment results in white hair, so a little eumelanin makes blonde hair.  It is this bit of eumelanin that gives it it's yellowish or blonde hue.  Blonde hair actually derives from brown hair, not red hair.  So eumelanin is responsible for black, brown, and blonde hair.  Pheomelanin is responsible for all red hair only.  Other than that, great article.  I enjoyed it.  Author Leah Lefler 2 years ago  from Western New York Isn't it interesting, Dolores? One of my children is blond and the other has red hair, and my red-head is very resistant to local anesthetics.  Author Leah Lefler 2 years ago  from Western New York The resistance to anesthetics is a very interesting side effect to the MC1R gene, mbwalz! My boys also have Ehlers Danlos syndrome, which causes resistance to local anesthetics. They have a double whammy, and our trips to the dentist are usually rather difficult (as you can imagine)!  Dolores Monet 2 years ago  from East Coast, United States As the mother of two red headed children, I used to think they were just whiners when they complained of pain. Now I know that they actually are more sensitive! I feel like a hardhearted mama! There seems to be a problem with electricity as well. I never knew two people who complained of electrical shocks like the two of them. Of course, they were such gorgeous kids. There is nothing more adorable than a red-headed child!  MaryBeth Walz 2 years ago  from Maine Thanks for the in depth info about us redheads! I just wrote a hub about our pain and the things that are being discovered through the mutation of the MC1R gene. It could lead, if there's enough interest and funding, in new classes of analgesics. In the mean time, we just get to ask for more lidacaine instead! Voted up and shared!  Author Leah Lefler 4 years ago  from Western New York Perhaps people are jealous of your red hair, Jill?  Jill 4 years ago  People are jealous  of me  I don't know why I'm almost 60  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York That is a good response! I love red hair and I'm glad one of my kids has it (though it is much less obvious now)!  Crystal Tatum 5 years ago  from Georgia Perhaps the best answer, as her parents finally taught my cousin to respond when asked where she got that red hair, is "God gave it to me"!  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York The genetics is interesting to me, Crystal Tatum - it is very possible to carry the red gene and have dark hair - when a child gets two copies of the genetic mutation, they will have red or orange hair. The actual genetics are a bit more complicated than that, of course - there are many different mutations and some are have more penetrance  (i.e. "stronger") than others. I have brown hair (blond as a child) and my husband has red hair - we have one son who has blond/brown hair and one son who has reddish hair.. though the red has become less obvious as he has gotten older and his hair has darkened!  Crystal Tatum 5 years ago  from Georgia The genetics bit was very well written but over my head. I do know that I have a cousin with a brown haired father and black haired mother who came out with orange hair. Apparently there was red hair on both sides of the family back a coulpe of genrations. She's never liked it much ....people were always coming up to her in stores and rubbing her hair! It's hard to believe how barbaric ancient civilizations could be. You did a great job with this hub. Voting up and interesting.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York I love genetics, pinkhawk - many genes have an effect beyond the obvious phenotype of having red hair. The increased skin cancer risk is simply the direct effect of the type of melanin the "red" genes express. Eumelanin protects against the sun's radiation; pheomelanin does not protect the skin.  pinkhawk 5 years ago  from Pearl of the Orient such an interesting topic! ^_^...thanks for sharing!...there's a reason for everything, wondering about its other function...  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York My five year old had very strawberry blond hair as a toddler, Tiffany, and now he is developing darker hair. I suspect he has a "weak" red hair gene or he is only a carrier of the gene. Still, his skin is extremely fair and we go through bucket loads of sunscreen each summer! My husband is a classic red head, and is very susceptible to skin damage from the sun.  tiffany delite 5 years ago  from united states thank you for this very interesting hub. my bestie has red hair and freckles and is so sensitive to the sun just like you said in this article! my hair was lighter when i was younger, and it has gotten darker as i have gotten older...that must mean my genes are slow starters...yes? lol. blessings!  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Redheads are a big part of my life, too - my husband is a redhead and my younger son was strawberry blond. His hair gets darker in the winter, but gets redder in the summer with exposure to the sun. As a toddler and preschooler, he had very reddish hair. My older son was blond as a baby and has brown hair now. You definitely have a life filled with redheads, PaisleeGal!  Pat Materna 5 years ago  from Memphis, Tennessee, USA Well this is a fascinating read. Redheads have always played a part in my life. While my hair is mousy brown I've always loved redhair.  My first love when I was 8 was redheaded. Then when I was 14 my first huge crush was a redhead. I finally married a redhead (not the same guy). My matron of honor at my wedding was redheaded. I was hoping one of my sons would be redheaded like their dad but they ended up like me with brown hair. Two yrs ago I thot my grandson was going to have redhair (his mom was a strawberry blond as a child) but alas so far his hair is not red but is a honey color and when in the sun you can see streaks of reddish.  So redheads have always been a big part of my life  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York It is fascinating, isn't it, Deborah? Since it is recessive, it really does take two carriers to have a child with red hair. My son has strawberry blond hair that has now darkened (but returns to its reddish hue during the summer months). He has the freckles to match, so we go through a lot of sunscreen!  Deborah Neyens 5 years ago  from Iowa Interesting! I'm a red head but never knew the genetics behind it. I'm told my red-headed, Irish great grandmother was bummed that none of her children or grandchildren were red heads, but after she passed, several of us came along in my generation and the next generation.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Current science disputes the theory - DNA has been sequenced from Neanderthal remains and the genetic sequencing shows an entirely different mutation in the MC1R gene than his found in humans - so the likelihood of a "genetic flow" from Neanderthals to homo sapiens is very low.  Tamara Wilhite 5 years ago  from Fort Worth, Texas What do you think of the theory that due to the age of the red haired gene, that it came from Neandertals?  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York I worry about the skin cancer risk, too, Kelly. We recently went to the beach and we used a lot of sunscreen on our boys to keep them from getting sunburned. I suppose forewarning is foreknowledge, and all we can do is use sunscreen and monitor for any skin changes!  Kelly Pittman 5 years ago  from Walker, LA My son is a red head - Or he likes to say it's orange. (He's 7 now)   My husband and I both have dark brown hair and our daughter has light brown hair as I did as a child.  Both sets of my husband and I's grandmothers were red heads so we assume we carried on something, though when someone asked our son, "Where do you get that red hair from?"  He replies, "It grows outta my head."  I do worry about the cancer risk as my grandmother died from a rare case of melanoma.   Nice work on this hub.  Very informative. Voted Up and Interesting.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York My mom had auburn hair, but my sister and I didn't pick up the red shade. I was tickled when Nolan's hair turned a beautiful strawberry blond (from my husband's side). The hair in our family tends to get darker with age, though, so it hides the red! Thanks for the comment, teaches!  Dianna Mendez 5 years ago  My mother had red hair but none her children received this blessing. I had tints of red in my hair,but this was the closest anyone came to red hair. I have to say my mother had the most beautiful color of red, it was a darker shade and thick.  Thanks for posting, I like your matrix on the dominant colors.  Voted up.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Hyphenbird, it is interesting how hair color changes with age. Sometimes the pigment producing cells produce more eumelanin as a person ages, but the gene for red hair is, of course, still there. The red color is just harder to see because it is masked by the darker hair. There are many variants of the MC1R gene that cause varying shades of red, and some are "weak" red genes that don't give the classic "carrot top" color. My husband's hair has darkened considerably, but he still has the freckles and his beard hair is very red!  Brenda Barnes 5 years ago  from America-Broken But Still Beautiful You did a great job and a lot of research on this Hub. My dad was a redhead and so was I as a child. Alas, my hair turned dark as I aged. By the time I was fifteen, it was dark brown. My mom had coal black hair so it was natural to be confused. lol I really was fascinated by your research and commend you.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York I did simplify the idea, of course - there are many polymorphisms of the MC1R gene that cause red hair, so one parent could easily carry one variant while another parent carries a different allele. And then there is complete vs. partial penetrance, etc. Still, it gives a general idea of how two brown haired parents might end up with a little redhead! Thanks for your comment, DFiduccia  DFiduccia 5 years ago  from Las Vegas Leahlefler, I haven’t seen a Punnett square since I retired from teaching. It brings back memories of Mendel and dominant/ submissive traits. You really got into this hub—great presentation. Voted up—DF  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Vanderleelie, there were many myths about redheads that fueled hatred and misunderstanding. Some in the Middle Ages believed that children with red hair were conceived while the mother was going through a menstrual cycle. In earlier times, it was believed to be a sign of witchcraft or an unlucky "mark." I am certainly glad my family lives in modern times!  Vanderleelie 5 years ago  This is interesting information.  The fact that redheads are more sensitive to pain is perhaps one reason why they were considered "different" in other time periods. Voted up!  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York The MC1R gene is here to stay - the same rumors circulated about blond hair going extinct. My younger son's hair is getting darker and the red isn't as obvious in the winter. In the summer, though, he has the most wonderful red hair.  Kimberly Schimmel 5 years ago  from North Carolina, USA I'm so glad red hair is not going extinct.  Hubby and I have red-haired great-aunts and I have a redheaded sister and neice.  Only one of our 6 kids is a redhead, but I'm hoping they all carry the gene on to future generations.

"Redhead" redirects here. For other uses, see Redhead (disambiguation) .     Woman with red hair       Man with red hair    Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1]  Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2]  Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered.  The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510.

Redheads today are commonly associated with the Celtic nations [4] and to a far lesser extent the Germanic peoples.  In Ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is estimated to be at around 10%, [5] making it the most red-haired country in the world. According to Britain's DNA, 34.7% of the Irish population carry the allele for red hair, although this doesn't directly translate proportionally into births of red-haired children. [6]  Scotland also has a very high percentage with around 6% of the population having red hair. [7] [8] Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA study used a sample of 2,343 people, and found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, with 35% overall carrying the allele and Edinburgh having the highest proportion at 40%. [7] [8] [9] The largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. [10]  England has a red hair prevalence of around 4%, with 28.5% of population having the allele; [7] while in Wales 38% of Welsh people carry the red-haired allele. [7] A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits from Great Britain found higher levels of red hair in Wales and the Scottish border counties of England . [fn 1] [11]  Eastern and Southern Europe     A Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale , c. 30 BC    Carleton Coon's 1939 book The Races of Europe stated that rufosity (reddish hair) often occurred in Montenegrins . [12] [13] [14]  In Italy , red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. [15] In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. [15]  Victorian era  ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga to be "the most red-headed men in the world", [16] a claim which has a solid basis even today, as the Volga region has more redheads per population than anywhere else in the world with the exception of Ireland . [17]  North Africa and Mediterranean      Hades abducting Persephone , fresco in the small royal tomb at Vergina , Macedonia, Greece , c. 340 BC    The Berber populations of Morocco [18] and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, [19] [20] [21] respectively. The Queen of Morocco , Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI , has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. [22] In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. [23] Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards . [24] In European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition , all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. [25] In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. [27] The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. [28]  Asia (all regions)     A Uyghur girl in Kashgar , China 's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair    In Asia, genetic red hair is rare, but reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair can be found in the Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine ), in Turkey , in Caucasia , in Northern Kazakhstan , among Uyghurs and among Indo-Iranians . [ editorializing ] The use of henna on hair and skin for various reasons occasionally occurs in Asia. When henna is used on hair it dyes the hair to different shades of red. [29] [30]  Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa  Emigration from Europe has multiplied the population of red haired humans in the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In the United States , it is estimated that 2–6% of the population has red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 420,000 in Ireland and 300,000 in Scotland. [7]  Historical     Woman with mixed reddish-brown hair, Papua New Guinea . Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair. [31]    Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. [32] The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red-haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. [33] [34]  In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians , who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China . Caucasian  Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC . [35]  Reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians , and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. [36] [37]  Biochemistry and genetics     A close-up view of red hair        Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum , made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii).    The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.  The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome  16 . Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer.  The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is unable to tan . Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not all-inclusive feature of red-haired people. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant [2] .  Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.  Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production. [38]  Genetics  The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His , and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. [39] The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA ) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. [40] [41]  In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.  Evolution  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. [42] In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift . [39]  Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. [43] [44]  A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans. [45]  Extinction hoax  See also: Disappearing blonde gene  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail , which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. [46] Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble , and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away". [47]  Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future. [47]  Medical implications of the red hair gene  Melanoma  Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning , but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage . Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. [48] It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. [49]  Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [50] [51]  Pain tolerance and injury  Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), [52] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. [53] [54] [55]  Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic . [56] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. [57] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide . [55]  The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins . (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC , and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. [58] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin , but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. [58] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.  There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. [59] [60] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising . [60]  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:   In cases of severe malnutrition , normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde . The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor , is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine .  One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea , results in red hair and red-colored skin. [61]  Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin . [61] [62]   Culture     Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum , late 1st-century BC to mid-1st century AD [63]       Polychrome Roman marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum    In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.      Portrait of a Lady , ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli        Elizabeth I of England , ca. 1588    Beliefs about temperament  A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables , a character says of Anne Shirley , the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye , Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair."  During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament . [64] In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda , redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.  Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels , "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms ," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that "neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo ] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe". [65] Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero . They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads. [66]  Media, fashion and art     "The Accolade" by Edmund Blair Leighton    Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman , Alyson Hannigan , Marcia Cross , Christina Hendricks , Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. [ citation needed ]  Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India , Iran , Bangladesh and Pakistan , henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance. [67]  Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color " Titian " takes its name from the artist Titian , who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli 's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites , Edmund Leighton , Modigliani , [68] and Gustav Klimt . [69]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes story " The Red-Headed League " (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor .  Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Red Sonja , Mystique , and Poison Ivy . [70]  Prejudice and discrimination against redheads  Medieval beliefs      Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral    Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers ( Der Eisenhans ) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper , in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk . [71]  Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum , [72] notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch , a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;   Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red.   Medieval antisemitism      Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd'    During the Spanish Inquisition , people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. [25] In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus , and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin . [27] The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. [28] The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David . The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau , even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'. [73]  Modern-day discrimination  "Carrot head" redirects here. For the French novel, see Poil de carotte .  In his 1885 book I Say No , Wilkie Collins wrote "The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair."  In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham , Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: "The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, "Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head," and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man." [74]  In British English , the word "ginger" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), [75] with terms such as "gingerphobia" [76] and "gingerism" [77] used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as "carrot tops" and "carrot heads". (The comedian " Carrot Top " uses this stage name .) "Gingerism" has been compared to racism , although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. [77]  Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for "being ginger". [78] In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; [79] in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne , was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair. [80] In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. [81] In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him "just because he had red hair". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. [82]  This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show . The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp , who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. [83] The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis ) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. [84] [85] ) Comedian Tim Minchin , himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song "Prejudice". [86]  The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the " Ginger Kids ", " Le Petit Tourette ", " It's a Jersey Thing " and " Fatbeard " episodes of South Park .  Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. [87] However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; "Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd," says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons . [88]  In Australian slang , redheads are often nicknamed "Blue" or "Bluey". [89] More recently, they have been referred to as "rangas" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. [90] The word "rufus" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; [91] based on a variant of rufous , a reddish-brown color.  In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a "National Kick a Ginger Day" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. [92]  In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words: " Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones " after customers complained the card was offensive. [93]  In October 2010, Harriet Harman , the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a "ginger rodent". [94] Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was "proud to be ginger". [95] Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. [96]  In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks , announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination . [97]  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo ( Chinese : 红毛 ; pinyin : hóng máo ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : âng-mo͘ ) in Hokkien ( Min Nan ) Chinese means "red-haired", [98] and is used in Malaysia and Singapore to refer to white people. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui ( 红毛鬼 ) meaning "red-haired devil", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo ("foreign devil"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. [99] Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. [100] Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times , [101] and in television programmes and films.  The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō ( 紅毛 ), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku , its 200-year period of isolation. [102]  Red hair festivals     Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day , September 2007    There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival is paid for by the local government in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands. [103] It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. Today, the festival includes music, fashion shows, art exhibitions and a picnic [104]  The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. [105]  A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. [106]  Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot) , held for the local Israeli red hair community, [107] including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. [108] However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. [109] The organizers state; "The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.” [109]  The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. [110]  Religious and mythological traditions  In the Iliad , Achilles ' hair is described as ξανθῆς [111] ( ksanthēs ) , usually translated as blonde, or golden [112] but sometimes as red or tawny. [113] [114] His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. [115]  The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. [116]     Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys    The Hebrew word usually translated "ruddy" or "reddish-brown" ( admoni  אדמוני , from the root ADM אדם , see also Adam and Edom ) [117] [118] [119] [120] was used to describe both Esau and David .  Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.  Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture [121] [122] and in the works of William Shakespeare , [123] reinforcing the negative stereotype.

Both parents are carriers. As shown in this punnett square , father (yellow) and mother (pink) contribute one of two possible alleles ( R or r ) of the MC1R variants to the baby. As a result, there is a 25% chance that any of their child will inherit two r alleles from each parents and will be a redhead. R r R RR Rr r Rr rr 2. One parent (e.g., mother) is a redhead and the father is a carrier. In this case, every child will inherit one r allele from their mother and has an equal chance of inheriting the R or r allele from the father. Therefore, the chance of each child being redheaded is 50/50. R r r Rr rr r Rr rr 3. If both parents have red hair, then all offspring will be red headed ( rr ). r r r rr rr r rr rr If one of the parent does not carry the red hair ( r ) allele , then no matter what the other parent's genotype ( RR , Rr , or rr ), none of their children will have red hair. Although some kids will be red hair carriers if they inherit a r allele. R R r Rr Rr r Rr Rr Preserving the Red Hair Trait The myth that redheads might die off in the near future has drawn considerable attentions. Due to the recessive nature of the red hair r allele, it takes 2 carriers ( Rr ) to have a red-headed child. With the increase of globalization and inter-ethnic mixing in marriage, it is reasonable to expect that the chance of 2 red hair carriers getting married and bearing children would be declining. When a red hair carrier marries to a non-carrier, their children are not red headed, but some will carry the red hair r allele. The frequency of the r alleles in the population in fact remains constant. We cannot easily tell if a person is a red hair carrier ( Rr ) without examining his/her extended family members' hair colors or analyzing his/her MC1R gene. Therefore, it is not possible to get a good estimate of the population of red hair carriers ( Rr ). However, we can reasonably expect the population of red hair carriers is much greater than that of the redheads. Even though there is no redhead in your immediate family, the chance that you are a carrier ( Rr ) is still quite high. It is estimated that as many as one in four Caucasians in the US might be a red hair carrier. Our RedTracer DNA Test can help you uncover whether you carry any of the red hair causing variants.                                  Home  About Genetics What is a Gene?  How Do Genes Work?

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I am pregnant and I was curious on the probability that our son will have red hair. My husband has bright red hair, and so did his mom. My grandmother, father and all my aunts and great grandmother had fire red hair while young. I have brownish-red hair. I would just like to know what our odds are.        -A curious adult from South Carolina   November 14, 2012  Usually these questions are tough to answer but not this time.  You (and I) are lucky enough to have all the right pieces in place to answer the question.  Because your husband and your dad have red hair, I can say pretty confidently that each of your kids has around a 50% chance for red hair.  This is so easy to figure out because we can figure out what red hair genes you and your husband have.  As I’ll show below, with that information in hand, figuring out your kids’ chances is a snap.  And this kind of analysis isn’t restricted to just red hair.  What I talk about here will work for blue eyes, green eyes, O blood type and any other simple recessive traits.  What I’ll do for the rest of the answer is show how I came up with the 50% number.  It has to do with the fact that we get one copy of each of our genes from each parent and that some traits can stay hidden.   Crouching Traits, Hidden Versions  Genes are pieces of DNA that each have the instructions for one small part of you.  So there is a gene that determines whether or not you’ll have brown eyes, another that determines green eyes, still another that determines whether or not you’ll have red hair and so on for each of your other 20,000 or so genes.  It is the red hair gene we are obviously interested in here.  The key gene involved in red hair is called MC1R.  It comes in two versions that we will call not-red and red.  For reasons that I’ll explain in a bit, I’ll call the not-red version R and the red version r.  We all have two sets of most of our genes--one set from mom and the other from dad.  This means we have two copies of the MC1R gene too.  So we have two copies of the MC1R gene and it comes in two versions.  Here are the three possible combinations of MC1R genes:    Remembering that R means not red and r means red, two of these three combinations are easy to figure out.  RR would mean not red and rr would mean red.  But what about Rr?  Turns out Rr almost never has red hair (although they can have red highlights).  This is because the R version of the MC1R gene is dominant over the recessive r version.  R beats out r and so an Rr person does not have red hair.  (In genetics, a capital letter means the dominant or winning version and a lower case letter means the recessive version.)  With this information, we can fill in our table like so:    We need just one more bit of information to figure out the chances that your kids will have red hair.  That final piece is that when we have kids, we pass just one of our copies down.  And that this copy is chosen at random. (Well, I guess there were two bits of information!)  So for example, an Rr person has a 50% chance of passing down an R and a 50% chance of passing down an r each time he or she has a child.  This is where your 50% comes from.   Figuring You Out  Now we are ready to figure out you and your husband’s genes.  From that, we can figure out your chances for having a redhead.  Let’s do the easy one first—your husband.  Since he has red hair, odds are he has two copies of the red version of the MC1R gene.  He is rr.  We can figure out your genes because of your father.  Since he is a redhead, he is rr.  What that means for you is that he had to pass you an r…that is all he had to give.  So we know you have at least one r.  But since you don’t have red hair, your other copy must be R.  So you are Rr, a carrier for red hair.  You do not have red hair but you can pass it down to your kids.  Now on to your kids. Your husband can only pass an r down to your kids.  This means they will all have at least one r (and so will all be at least carriers for red hair).  As you can see below, each time you have a child, there is a 50% chance you will pass an R and a 50% chance you will pass an r.  Combining you and your husband, we get a 50% chance for Rr (r from dad, R from mom) and a 50% chance for rr (r from both parents).  So there is a 50% chance for a redhead (rr) and a 50% chance for a child without red hair (Rr).    See, that wasn’t so hard!  We were saved by the fact that you had a red haired parent.  As we talk about in our previous answer , if you hadn’t, things would have got a lot more complicated very quickly.  One last point.  Just because each of your kids has a 50% chance for red hair, that does not mean half your kids will.  If you had four kids, they could all have red hair, none of them could, or you could have some combination of kids with and without red hair.  It all has to do with what copy of the MC1R gene you passed on with each pregnancy.  Remember, the copy is chosen at random and what came before doesn’t affect what comes after.  If you had three redheads, your chances for a redhead in the next pregnancy would still be 50%.  Because your chances for passing an r are still 50%.  This is sort of like flipping a coin.  Just because you get heads, that does not affect the next flip.  There is still a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  Just like your MC1R versions!

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

These are external links and will open in a new window   Close share panel                  About 200 people took part in the UK's first Ginger Pride march in August, and the world record for the largest gathering of natural redheads was broken last month when 1,600 attended the Redhead Day Festival in the Dutch town of Breda. But how many redheads are there in the world - and where do they live? Scotland is thought by some to have the highest concentration of redheads in the world, so maybe it was an appropriate location for the Ginger Pride march, led by Canadian comedian Shawn Hitchins. While they marched through the streets of Edinburgh, he made a startling claim. "It's a great opportunity to bring together all the redheads in the country that holds 19% of the world's population of redheads," he told BBC Radio . The claim was initially reported on BBC News too. But can it really be true that Scotland is home to almost a fifth of the world's redheads?     "I can't really believe that figure," says Jonathan Rees, professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh and one of a team of scientists to identify the gene responsible for red hair - the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) .  We don't have very detailed information about the frequency of people with red hair Jonathan Rees   So where did Hitchins get the figure from? It turns out it was a mistake. "It must have been in confusion," he says. "I was walking through Edinburgh with 200 redheads behind me and I was mostly trying not to lead people into traffic. Nobody really knows the exact [number]. There was someone from Glasgow saying it was 19% in just the population of Scotland." In the heat of the moment, it seems, he simply got his words muddled, and that proportion of redheads in Scotland became something very different. "I am very sorry. This is what happens when you let comedians be spokespeople," says Hitchins. "Also, I'm a ginger so I'm 10 times more likely to make up a statistic."      Image caption  Shawn Hitchins at the Edinburgh Ginger Pride march   So if we can now confidently say that a fifth of the world's redheads do not live in Scotland, do we know what proportion actually do? "It's fair to say we don't have very detailed information about what the frequency of people with red hair is throughout the world," says Rees.

"We don't have that sort of data, but many different researchers have carried out smaller studies where the selection has not been entirely random in the way you would like." It is often said that between 1% and 2%, or 70 to 140 million people around the world, have red hair. In purely numerical terms, it is highly likely that the US has the highest number of people with red hair, because of the size of its population. If just 1% had red hair, for example, that would mean it had three million redheads.      Image caption  US actress Julianne Moore with fellow redheads   According to Rees, the figure for the UK is about 10%. If that was the case in Scotland, that would suggest that the country with its population of 5.3 million was home to just over half a million redheads - less than 1% of the global total. The prevalence of red hair may be slightly higher in Scotland than in England, Rees says, adding that it may be even higher in the Republic of Ireland. Overall, Northern European countries have a greater proportion of redheads than anywhere else in the world.  More on gingers from the Magazine  Do they really want to seek out those with similar colouring? The Magazine's Clare Spencer went to Breda's Red Hair Day in 2009 .  "I think redheads do enjoy being together and not being the odd one out," said Alan Petrie, of Aberdeen.  Civil servant Anneloes Rynders  prefers being unusual: "In my youth it wasn't nice to be different. It changed about the age of 16 or 17. I got more confidence, I went out and got attention because I'm a redhead."  But she is disappointed that none of her children has ginger hair.  Is gingerism as bad as racism?       "If you're in northern Europe, you get used to seeing people with different hair colour," says Rees. "But most of the people on this planet don't live in Europe and if you just think about Asia, it's very, very rare to see somebody with red hair. And in most of Africa it is exceedingly rare to see somebody with red hair. It is an unusual trait globally." To explain this, you have to go back tens of thousands of years, says Rees. "When humans moved out of Africa… skin lightened and people developed hair with different colours. There seems to be some advantage in having pale skin if you live in parts of the world where there isn't much sunshine," he says. "The probable reason for that is that we make vitamin D in our skin. We rely on sunshine to make vitamin D and if you have very dark skin, it's harder to make that vitamin D." Being pale, redheads are more efficient at making vitamin D and do not need so much sunlight in order to get the amount they need, he says. So, in certain places in the world at least, there's a big advantage to being in this minority.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       I am pregnant and I was curious on the probability that our son will have red hair. My husband has bright red hair, and so did his mom. My grandmother, father and all my aunts and great grandmother had fire red hair while young. I have brownish-red hair. I would just like to know what our odds are.        -A curious adult from South Carolina   November 14, 2012  Usually these questions are tough to answer but not this time.  You (and I) are lucky enough to have all the right pieces in place to answer the question.  Because your husband and your dad have red hair, I can say pretty confidently that each of your kids has around a 50% chance for red hair.  This is so easy to figure out because we can figure out what red hair genes you and your husband have.  As I’ll show below, with that information in hand, figuring out your kids’ chances is a snap.  And this kind of analysis isn’t restricted to just red hair.  What I talk about here will work for blue eyes, green eyes, O blood type and any other simple recessive traits.  What I’ll do for the rest of the answer is show how I came up with the 50% number.  It has to do with the fact that we get one copy of each of our genes from each parent and that some traits can stay hidden.   Crouching Traits, Hidden Versions  Genes are pieces of DNA that each have the instructions for one small part of you.  So there is a gene that determines whether or not you’ll have brown eyes, another that determines green eyes, still another that determines whether or not you’ll have red hair and so on for each of your other 20,000 or so genes.  It is the red hair gene we are obviously interested in here.  The key gene involved in red hair is called MC1R.  It comes in two versions that we will call not-red and red.  For reasons that I’ll explain in a bit, I’ll call the not-red version R and the red version r.  We all have two sets of most of our genes--one set from mom and the other from dad.  This means we have two copies of the MC1R gene too.  So we have two copies of the MC1R gene and it comes in two versions.  Here are the three possible combinations of MC1R genes:    Remembering that R means not red and r means red, two of these three combinations are easy to figure out.  RR would mean not red and rr would mean red.  But what about Rr?  Turns out Rr almost never has red hair (although they can have red highlights).  This is because the R version of the MC1R gene is dominant over the recessive r version.  R beats out r and so an Rr person does not have red hair.  (In genetics, a capital letter means the dominant or winning version and a lower case letter means the recessive version.)  With this information, we can fill in our table like so:    We need just one more bit of information to figure out the chances that your kids will have red hair.  That final piece is that when we have kids, we pass just one of our copies down.  And that this copy is chosen at random. (Well, I guess there were two bits of information!)  So for example, an Rr person has a 50% chance of passing down an R and a 50% chance of passing down an r each time he or she has a child.  This is where your 50% comes from.   Figuring You Out  Now we are ready to figure out you and your husband’s genes.  From that, we can figure out your chances for having a redhead.  Let’s do the easy one first—your husband.  Since he has red hair, odds are he has two copies of the red version of the MC1R gene.  He is rr.  We can figure out your genes because of your father.  Since he is a redhead, he is rr.  What that means for you is that he had to pass you an r…that is all he had to give.  So we know you have at least one r.  But since you don’t have red hair, your other copy must be R.  So you are Rr, a carrier for red hair.  You do not have red hair but you can pass it down to your kids.  Now on to your kids. Your husband can only pass an r down to your kids.  This means they will all have at least one r (and so will all be at least carriers for red hair).  As you can see below, each time you have a child, there is a 50% chance you will pass an R and a 50% chance you will pass an r.  Combining you and your husband, we get a 50% chance for Rr (r from dad, R from mom) and a 50% chance for rr (r from both parents).  So there is a 50% chance for a redhead (rr) and a 50% chance for a child without red hair (Rr).    See, that wasn’t so hard!  We were saved by the fact that you had a red haired parent.  As we talk about in our previous answer , if you hadn’t, things would have got a lot more complicated very quickly.  One last point.  Just because each of your kids has a 50% chance for red hair, that does not mean half your kids will.  If you had four kids, they could all have red hair, none of them could, or you could have some combination of kids with and without red hair.  It all has to do with what copy of the MC1R gene you passed on with each pregnancy.  Remember, the copy is chosen at random and what came before doesn’t affect what comes after.  If you had three redheads, your chances for a redhead in the next pregnancy would still be 50%.  Because your chances for passing an r are still 50%.  This is sort of like flipping a coin.  Just because you get heads, that does not affect the next flip.  There is still a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  Just like your MC1R versions!

By: Rosemary O. Fernandez Around this time last year, I got the best news of my life: My husband and I were expecting a baby! We kept it to ourselves for a while, but soon told our family and friends. As I inevitably expanded, I was asked the inevitable question: Will the little one have red hair too? This was a perfectly reasonable question as I was born with screaming red hair –the kind of shade that has prompted numerous strangers to tell me I have the map of Ireland written on my face despite the fact that I’m mostly Italian. I inherited these locks from my (Italian) mother, and my husband’s mother and grandfather are also gingers. Needless to say, the odds were in the little guy’s favor. Thirty-eight weeks slugged by, and I’d estimate that I heard the question about three times a week. Coworkers joked about it. Family members hoped for it. Random people at the grocery store thought it would be terrific. Naturally all my husband and I prayed for was a healthy child. Whether he popped out with red, blonde, brown, or green hair, we’d cuddle and dote on him just the same. But I’d be lying if I said I never crossed my fingers and daydreamed about strolling down the street with a fiery-headed toddler in tow. Here are some facts to see if  you will have a redhead baby: 1. In order for a baby to have red hair, both parents have to carry the gene, since it’s a recessive trait. So if you’re a ginger and you marry a ginger, odds are, your kids will be gingers, too. If only one parent has the locks but the other is a carrier, the baby’s chances are 50/50. If neither of you are red but you both are carriers, you have a one in four chance of a fiery-haired child. And, sorry to say, if only one parent is not a carrier (even though the other is), you’ve got no shot. [ Source ] 2. Even though you might not be a redhead yourself, studies estimate that 25 percent of Caucasian Americans carry the ginger gene, so if you fall into this category you might end up with a redheaded baby when you’re least expecting it. [ Source ] READ: 10 Things To Know If You’re a Redhead Baby My reasons weren’t purely aesthetic, because for me, my hair color is a huge part of my personality. I’m confident. I’m intelligent. I’m friendly. I’m funny (though my husband says it’s usually when I don’t mean to be). Growing up, my hair helped me cultivate these qualities. I’m used to strangers addressing me simply because they want to pay me a compliment about my hair; therefore I have no problem doing the same to someone else when I like their outfit or a speech they presented. On the first day of school when teachers called my name, they also told me they liked my hair; hence I became comfortable in a classroom from an early age, absorbed more information, and was never too timid to raise my hand when I knew the answer. I’m often the only redheaded in my group of friends, so I developed a good sense of direction; since I’m the most easily spotted in a crowd, my pals often followed me when we were out. Here are some other fun facts about redheads in general: Enjoy those baby blues while they last. The world’s rarest hair and eye color combo is red hair and blue eyes. [ Source ]  number 4 on list ] Redheads are more likely to be left-handed. [ Source ] Redheaded babies are the cutest babies. Ok, this one’s just my opinion. READ: Facts About Redheads That May Surprise You I want all this and more for my child. More than I want to dress him in t-shirts that have fun redheaded slogans, I want him to be confident. I want him to know he’s smart. I want him to not be afraid to be kind. Though hair color doesn’t determine these qualities, I know from experience that it helps. Sixteen weeks after birth, what’s the verdict? The jury’s still out. The baby was born with dark hair. Those strands have now mostly fallen out, and it looks like some red is replacing it. Only time will tell. But I still have my fingers crossed. Rock it like a Redhead!

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd than a blonde or brunette. They are few and far between; about one to two percent of the population possesses natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart - genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads," the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin — a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytes is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rare because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and require more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutation causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors. Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature got down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise Redheads are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are some normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

Red hair is a beautiful genetic mutation Both parents must be carriers of the mutated MC1R gene to be able to produce redhead offspring, of which there is a 25% chance if they don't have red hair themselves. 2. Less than 2% of the world's population have red hair That's approximately 140 million people. Scotland boasts the highest percentage of natural redheads, with 13% (40% might carry the gene there) while Ireland comes in second with 10%.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    3. Red hair can occur in any ethnicity It occurs more frequently (2-6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. 4. Lucky redhead women have more sex That's according to a study by a German sex researcher who found that women with red hair had sex more often. A similar English study found that redhead gals had sex an average of three times a week, while our blonde and brunette counterparts have it twice a week. Shame the fellas weren't questioned, too. 5. It's a ballache to dye red hair Because it holds its pigment tighter than any other hair colour, red strands need to have their pigment stripped before being dyed by bleaching which, of course, damages the hair. Stay red!                      Getty Images     Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    6. Red hair is thicker than other colours Each strand of red hair is generally thicker than other shades which compensates for the fact that redheads have less hair. Apparently they have – on average – 90,000 strands while blondes have 110,000, and brunettes have 140,000. 7. Redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer Because of their commonly fair skin and sensitivity to ultraviolet light, redheads are more likely to develop skin cancer. The International Journal of Cancer reported in 2010 that natural redheads are approximately two and a half times as likely to develop the dangerous cancer as people with other hair hues. 8. Blue eyed redheads are super rare Blue eyes and red hair forms the rarest combo on earth. Most (natural) redheads will have brown eyes, followed by hazel or green shades. 9. Redheads can change temperature quicker This is because – according to research – redheads are more sensitive to hot and cold pain. Nothing to do with their mythical fiery temperament! 10. Redheads don't go grey Red hair will never turn grey; it simply fades to white via rose gold when the time comes.                                 giphy    11. Redheads can produce their own Vitamin D As they can't sufficiently absorb Vitamin D (it's down to their lower melanin-concentration), redheads internally produce their own Vitamin D when they're exposed to low light conditions. Woah! 12. People with red hair are more likely to be left-handed Recessive traits often happen in pairs so commonly people with the gene for red hair also possess the trait for left-handedness. 13. Climate change is threatening the gene Given that red hair doesn't adapt to warm climes, the gene could - at some point - become extinct. A scientist told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out… Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland." Noooooo!

By Marc Lallanilla, Life's Little Mysteries Assistant Editor | January 28, 2013 11:19am ET                            MORE           The redhead gene is recessive and can skip several generations.  Credit: Thaiview | Shutterstock     Some parents worry that their children will be born with a rare disease or a hidden genetic disorder. Other parents, however, wonder if their children will possess something more obvious: red hair.  A British ancestry company, BritainsDNA, is now offering parents the chance to see if their children might inherit the so-called "ginger gene," the Telegraph reports . The test will scan each parent's DNA for signs of the so-called MC1R gene that causes redheadedness.  "Through a simple saliva test to determine deep ancestry, we can … identify whether an individual is a carrier of any of the three common redhead variants in the gene MC1R," said Dr. Jim Wilson, chief scientist at BritainsDNA, as quoted in the Huffington Post .  The gene for red hair is recessive, so a person needs two copies of that gene for it to show up or be expressed. That means even if both parents carry the gene, just one in four of their children are likely to turn out to be a redhead. As a result, families that have no redheads for decades can suddenly discover a carrottop in their midst.  "Families can carry a variant for generations, and when one carrier has children with another carrier, a redheaded baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere." Wilson said, as quoted in the Daily Mail .  Though there's no scientific evidence that redheads deserve their reputation for having fiery temperaments, some recent reports suggest having red hair is associated with a number of health issues. A study from the journal Nature found that the pigment pheomelanin, which is responsible for red hair, may also make redheads even more susceptible to melanoma than fair-skinned blondes, according to the Los Angeles Times .  And a widely reported study from the Journal of the American Dentistry Association found that redheads are more sensitive to pain and require extra anesthesia during surgery, according to ABC News .  But there may be some advantages to having red hair, too, EverydayHealth.com reports. The pale skin that redheads usually have is more efficient at soaking up sunlight — and sunlight is required for the body to manufacture vitamin D , an essential nutrient.  Worldwide, red hair is quite rare, and just over 0.5 percent, or one in 200 people, are redheads — this amounts to almost 40 million people, the Daily Mail reports.  In Ireland, an estimated 10 percent of the population has red hair, though about 40 percent of the Irish carry the recessive gene. In Scotland and England, 13 percent and 6 percent, respectively, are redheaded, according to the Daily Mail.  The DNA test will be offered by BritainsDNA at a genealogy and ancestry exhibition named Who Do You Think You Are , associated with the popular NBC television show and scheduled to be held in London next month.

Both my parents have brown hair, so it seems strange that I have ginger hair. What is the likelihood of our children having ginger hair? No-one else as far as I know in my family or my partner's family has ginger hair either.  Chloe Jakes, Blandford, UK   What colour hair did the milkman have? Paul Turner, Toronto, Canada    Hair colour is determined by the genetic make up of your parents and grandparents and great grandparents etc...
Every generation will carry the ginger gene, though in your families recent history (until you were born) the gene was recessive, hence your parents and grandparents didn't have ginger hair.
There's around 25% chance that your children will have ginger hair. the calculation works like this:
There are 2 hair colours that you'll pass to your children black (b) and ginger (g)
If we mix those colours and assume that the ginger gene is recessive i.e. it will always be dominated by black the following results are available: bb bg gb gg
Ony the gg result would produce a ginger haired child. So your parents may have been a bg and a bg but both their hair colours were black, as it turned out you were the 1 in 4 gg, likewise your partner could carry the recessive ginger gene but she also has the black gene which is dominant. Andy Preston, Otley, UK    To have ginger hair, you must have received one copy of what is a recessive gene from each of your parents. They only had one copy each, since the other, dominant gene for brown hair colouring was being expressed in their case.
What this means is that all your children will receive one ginger hair gene from you and the likelihood of them having ginger hair will depend on what they receive from your partner. If, like your parents, your partner is carrying a single ginger hair gene along with a single brown hair one, then your children will have a 50/50 chance of having ginger hair. If your partner has no genes for ginger hair, then the chance is nil, and you will have to wait for grandchildren for another chance for your ginger hair to re-express itself. Ian Brown, Herne Hill, UK    One theory used to be that red hair was a recessive condition: ie that both your parents carried a gene for red hair while also having one for dark hair. The "dark-haired" gene would have been dominant, giving them the dark-hair phenotype. If both of them happened to pass on the red-haired gene to you, you'd have both the phenotype and genotype for red hair. With regards to you and your husband having a red-haired offspring, we'd have to guess whether he's a carrier for the red-hair gene. Gerry Dunlop, Zeal Monachorum, Crediton, UK    I would sit your mother down and have a frank discussion about her prior relationship with the milkman. Louise Vippond, Doha, Qatar    Andy Preston's calculation of a 1 in 4 chance relates to a future sibling of yours, not to a child. If your partner carries the gene for ginger hair, then there is a 1 in 2 chance that your child will have ginger hair. If he does not, then there is no chance.
To talk in general terms about "the likelihood" gets us into all sorts of problems about subjective probability. The fact that no-one in your partner's family has ginger hair means that he is less likely to carry the gene for ginger hair than an average person of his age, birth town, medical history, etc. Pelham Barton, Birmingham, UK    I do not know, but I wish you luck. Jonathan, Lancaster, England    I heard that neither of your parents need to have the gene for ginger hair and that it comes from a lack in Eumelanin James B, London, England    1 in 2 chance of your child being a redhead if your parter carries the ginger gene. Zero chance of you having a child with red hair if your partner does not carry the ginger gene. Indi, Glasgow, Scotland    My Mum's father had ginger hair. My Mum (his only child) had brown hair. I'm one of six kids, two of which have ginger hair.
Both of us ginger haired siblings have children.
Julian has Taylor,I have Ellis and Owen.
All three have ginger hair,despite our partners having brown hair.
Im ever so proud that we are going forth and multiplying. Rory Wilson, Watford England    Red hair is caused by a mutation of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene on chromosome 16. Most red heads have a mutation on both copies of this gene, however approximately 15% have the mutation on only one of the genes and typically have lighter red hair. So red hair is not a generic genetics problem you can solve with a simple punnet square. Ashleigh, Lexington USA    FYI for anyone who chances across this board in the future... I KNOW red hair does not work like they teach it in school. I know it is possible to have red hair even if you only have one parent with the gene. My dad's dad had blond hair, his mom had dark brown hair. My dad has brown and his sister had blond. My dad is either a Brown/blond or Brown/brown genotype. I have Irish Setter-like red hair as does my mom. I know there was no "milk man" because I otherwise look very much like my dad's family (more so than my mom's) including a chin cleft (another genetically inherited trait). My mom's red hair came to her similarly. Grandpa had black hair, grandma red. My mom's brothers have dark brown hair, so grandpa wasn't a red/Black and grandma wasn't a red/red. Red hair is co-dominant in cows maybe in people too. You might have a ginger child...some shade of red from strawberry to copper or auburn. Anne R, Santa Barbara USA    Wow im really worried about this i have ginger has as so as my grandmother and cusion but not my partner or his family do you think my children will have ginger hair???? Chloe Flaherty, stoke on trent uk    I am a ginger and proud of it! So much so that I pray my children will be gingers too! Johann Venter, Sasolburg South Africa    First of all I think it is very sad but also quite hilarious that people are 'worried' that their children will have red hair!!
However just to add to the previous answers, yes red hair is usually caused by a mutation in the MC1R gene which can be inherited. It is also the case that ANYONE can have a mutation of ANY gene so even someone with non-carrying parents can have red hair.
You might be better 'worrying' about future children being born with serious illnesses rather than red hair!

I have light brown hair and my husband has red hair. I want to know what the probability of having a child with red. Is it likely?  Ashley, Saratoga Springs United States   Very likely !
Red hair carries a far more dominant chromosome than brown hair. rebecca, bradford uk    This depends if you have a red hair gene stored in your DNA. We each have a pair of genes for any trait like hair color, one from each parent.
The one that takes precedent is the dominant gene. Red hair is a recessive gene, so your husband has two red hair genes. The only way for your child to have red hair is if you have a recessive red gene (being covered by the dominant brown hair gene) and that is the gene that gets passed onto the baby. Kayla Iacovino, Tempe, United States    To add to Kayla Iacovino's answer. If you don't have the recessive Red gene none of your offspring will have red hair but all of them will carry the red gene from their dad so red-headed grandchildren are on the cards. If you do have the recessive red gene then 1 in 4 of your children will be redheads. G. Baker, South Ockendon, UK    If it's lucky! Vivienne, London, UK    Actually the red hair gene is recessive to blonde and brown etc. You have two alleles, one from your mom and one from your dad. In your husbands case he has "Red"/"Red" and you could have "Brown"/"Brown", "Brown"/"Blonde", of "Brown"/"Red". If it is the first couple then your children CANNOT have red hair, impossible. However if you happen to have a recessive red hair gene perhaps from one of your parents who might have had it as well then there is a high chance. You give either a Brown or Red gene and your husband gives a Red or Red gene so I'd say a 50% in that case.
But probably 0% but as mentioned, watch out for grandchildren ;) two people who don't have red hair but carry the gene can have children who have red hair. Darren Bridgewater, Hartlepool England    Years and years ago, before my husband and I were married, or even going out together, he said to me jokingly one day, "We could never get married, because our kids would be redheads!" (I have darkish red hair, he had very dark reddish hair). As it turned out, we did get married and our three kids all do have red hair... all are, of course, gorgeous! No, really! In Ireland, there isn't the same awful "ginger" stigma that there is in England. Nurn, Galway    I have blonde/brown hair, and my husband has red hair. My first son has brown eyes and brown hair with a few surprsing RED hairs all over his head. Interesting huh?
I want to see grandchildren with red hair. Melanie, North Babylon USA    To correct a few errors above. If you are not carrying the red hair gene all your children will have a red hair gene from their father and a non-red one from you and so probably be non-red. Current knowledge suggests it is not a zero chance; there is at least one other, different but rare, gene that can give red hair, and there are red haired individuals who appear to have only a red/non-red genetic makeup.
On the other hand if you are a red hair carrier, so you have one red and one non-red gene, then each child will have essentially a 50% chance of having two red-hair genes. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the child will have red hair. The "red hair" gene actually comes in several version, some of which are incompletely expressed so they may only give red hair say 10% of the time. The reason for this is not known but probably involves interactions with other genes.
So what are the chances of carrying a red hair gene? Analysis of UK or UK origin populations finds that almost half the population are carriers of one or another red hair form of the gene, so you have a high chance of being a carrier.
I should also say that current data suggests that the gene or genes responsible for blonde versus non-blonde are different from the red non-red gene. Ian Jackson, Edinburgh UK    Why risk it? Alex, Derby, England    What do you mean 'why risk it'     Well first of all I wish I lived in Ireland! If they don't have the stigma of being a horrid "ginger" then I'm going!
I have dark red hair from parents with brown hair (and freckles). My brother has brown hair. I have 2 grandparents on each side who had red hair - hence it hiding in my parents, until they met and produced one brown haired baby and one (me) red head.
My boyfriend has also got red hair (but very pale) but his parents are both non-red heads. He doesn't know about his grandparents.
Will we have children with red hair 100%? It is everybody else's main concern! Melanie, London, UK    well...its look like you are talking about my case..:), my mother has light brown hair and my dad has red hair..i got the red hair as the first child but my youngest brother and sister has light brown hair. Reem, Jordan    This post is probably closed by now, I replied to it a long time ago.
I remember when I was a kid in the USA (long time ago), people (ok, women) used to stop me and ooh and aah after my hair colour and told me I was so lucky to have hair that colour.
They do the same now to my daughters now , in Ireland, where every well-to-do woman is now very blonde with an orangey tan; but not to my son, although his hair is more blondey-red.
Guess what, though? Hair colour doesn't guarantee you a happy life! Who'd have thought? Nurn, Galway Ireland    I have mousy brown hair and my boyfriend has ginger hair containing a mix of brown as well
We have two kids together, our first one has brown hair but when he is in the sun you can see the ginger colour on top and our second child also a boy has black hair but also same with him has the ginger colour on top when he's in the sun
But you cant ask for it, it just happens with the hair colour, you can say i want a ginger haired kid, you just have to wait and see really. jodie, united kingdom    My husband had blonde hair, I have darkish brown, and I had 4 children - one blonde one brown and two redheads, whoops did I get a ribbing!! mary durant, worthing west sussex    Genes are strange things...
I have ginger hair and light brown eyes and my sister has dark brown hair and light brown eyes also (our mum has black hair and brown eyes / dad has light brown hair and grey eyes. All grandparents were dark brown or black haired). My partner has dark brown hair and blue eyes (his mum has dark brown hair with brown eyes / his dad is dark brown hair and blue eyes).
Our daughter has blonde hair (no ginger tones at all) and green eyes.
My sister has 5 kids. Their father is half Chinese with black hair. All her kids have light brown hair but all have ginger tones/ highlights especially when they have been in the sun.
Like I said, genes are strange things :) Kay, London Uk   Add your answer                          Privacy policy | Terms & conditions | Advertising guide | A-Z index | Inside guardian.co.uk | About this site Join our dating site today guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2011                                             MORE Sign In Join    89    Owlcation » STEM » Genetics & Evolution     Redheads: The Genetics of Hair Color Updated on October 15, 2017   Leah Lefler   more Contact Author   Genetics of Red Hair What do Napoleon Bonaparte, Oliver Cromwell, and Thomas Jefferson have in common? Besides the obvious similarity as heads-of-state, all three had red hair.  Hair color ranges from platinum blond to ebony, due to levels of pigments produced by specialized cells called melanocytes. Those with dark hair have cells that produce a pigment called eumelanin, and those with blond or red hair have cells that produce pheomelanin. The relative ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin determines a person’s hair color. A complete absence of both pigments leads to white hair color.  The gene responsible for determining hair color is called the Melanocortin 1 Receptor, or MC1R. If the MC1R gene is active, it produces eumelanin and a person will have darker skin and hair. If the MC1R gene does not function (i.e. it is blocked or inactivated), the melanocytes will produce pheomelanin instead of eumelanin. A person with a malfunctioning MC1R gene will have blond or red hair, due to the lack of eumelanin, along with freckles. MC1R gene mutations are seen in all ethnicities.   My husband and son carry MC1R polymorphisms, and display the red hair phenotype. | Source       MC1R Gene Location The MC1R gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16. Its official location is 16q24.3, and is 3,098 base pairs in length. Depending on the specific mutation (known as a polymorphism in the language of genetics), hair color will range from strawberry blond to auburn. The MC1R gene encodes a protein made up of 317 amino acids. Over 35 sites on the gene have been identified with polymorphisms, and only a small number of these mutations cause red hair shades.   Red Hair Mutations and Hair Color   Allele   Phenotype   R151C   red hair, increased melanoma risk   R160W   red hair, pale skin, increased melanoma risk   D294H   red hair, pale skin, increased melanoma risk   R142H   red hair, pale skin, increased melanoma risk   D84E   red hair, increased melanoma risk   V60L   Weak red hair gene, increased melanoma risk   V92M   Weak red hair gene, increased melanoma risk   R163Q   Weak red hair gene, increased melanoma risk      How likely am I to Have a Child with Red Hair? Red hair is recessive, which means a person may have brown hair, and carry the “red gene” without expressing the hair color. A person must have two copies of the recessive gene to express the trait. The chances of having a child with red hair depend on the genes of the parents. For simplicity’s sake, the various polymorphisms in the MC1R gene will be called the “red hair gene.” The red hair gene will be labeled as a lowercase r in the charts below and brown hair will be labeled with an upper case R.   Case 1: Parents with Brown Hair In the first scenario, two parents have brown hair and do not carry any polymorphisms on the MC1R gene. In other words, neither of the parents is a carrier for the red hair gene. None of their children will have red hair, unless a new mutation arises spontaneously. These parents have almost no chance of having a child with red hair, unless a de novo mutation were to arise.         Case 2: Brown-Haired Carriers In the second scenario, both parents have brown hair, but carry a red-hair causing gene. These parents are both called “carriers” of the gene. In this case, the parents will have a 25% chance of having a child with brown hair who does not carry the red gene. They have a 50% chance of having a child with brown hair who carries the red gene. There is a 25% chance that the parents will have a child with red hair.     Case 3: Parents with Brown and Red Hair A third possibility involves a parent with red hair and a parent with brown hair. The parent with brown hair in this case is not a carrier of the red gene. Each of the children will have one allele for the red hair gene, and will be carriers of the gene. None of the children, however, will display the physical trait of having red hair.         Case 4: Parents with Brown Hair (Carrier) and Red Hair In a fourth scenario, one parent has red hair and the other has brown hair, but is a carrier of the red gene. There is a 50% chance that the children will have red hair, and a 50% chance that the children will be brown-haired carriers of the red gene.  This is the scenario in my own family: I have brown hair and probably do not carry red-causing MC1R polymorphisms. My husband, however, has the classic red hair phenotype. One of my sons is blond, and the other has strawberry blond hair.     Case 5: Parents with Red Hair The last case includes two parents with red hair: in this situation, all of the children would have the same phenotype as the parents. The children will all have red hair, since neither parent has the dominant "brown hair" MC1R genotype. In some cases, different polymorphisms (alleles) may be inherited from each parent. This scenario is common in locations where red hair is a common occurrence: primarily in Scotland and Ireland.         Genetic Mutation MC1R: Beyond Hair Color The MC1R gene is expressed in many cells, and is responsible for more than hair color. MC1R plays a role in inflammatory response, pain sensitivity, and the immune system. The far reaching effects of the MC1R gene are listed below:  Cancer risk  Redheads have an increased risk for melanoma, as the melanocytes in people with red hair do not produce the protective eumelanin pigment. Unfortunately, the risk of cancer is increased even when there is no exposure to sunlight , so those with red hair should have regular check-ups with a dermatologist to monitor any skin changes. It is important to note that people who have dark skin and MC1R mutations are also at risk for skin cancer.  Increased pain sensation  People who have red hair are more sensitive to pain caused by burns and freezing than people with brown hair. Studies performed by Edwin B. Liem at the National Institutes of Health demonstrated an increased sensation of pain caused by thermal changes, and an increased need for anesthetic. Redheads required 19% more anesthetic than their brown haired counterparts. Interestingly, those with red hair demonstrate a reduced sensitivity to stinging pain (the type of pain encountered when receiving an injection). The MC1R gene affects the binding of endorphins, which are the body’s natural painkillers.   Melanoma Risk in Europe A map showing the density of light-eyed people in Western Europe. Melanoma risk increases for those who produce less eumelanin. | Source   Famous Redheads Emily Dickinson, the American poet  Antonio Vivaldi, the Italian composer  Mark Twain, the American author  Malcolm X, civil rights activist  Cleopatra, Egyptian ruler  Vladimir Lenin, Russian revolutionary    Red Hair Stereotypes and Beliefs The most common modern stereotype about redheads is that red hair comes with a fiery, feisty personality. Earlier in history, redheads faced more dangerous beliefs about their red hair. In ancient Egypt, redheads were burned alive as a sacrifice to the god Osiris. Their ashes were blown over agricultural fields by winnowing fans and used as fertilizer for the season’s crops. Early Egyptians regarded red hair as an unlucky trait.  In the middle ages, those with red hair could be labeled as witches or vampires. The Malleus Maleficarum (a report on witches in the Middle Ages) states, “Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires.”       Other Causes of Red Hair Some people do not come by their red hair via the MC1R gene. One type of albinism (type 3, or rufous albinism) demonstrates a phenotype of red hair and ruddy skin. This form of albinism is most common in New Guinea and Africa.  Severe malnutrition can lead to a condition known as kwashiorkor – the deprivation of protein and calories from an individual’s diet will lead to failure to thrive, edema, excessive hair growth, and depigmentation, along with the development of red hair. The Biblical story of Esau is fascinating in this regard, because the Bible describes Esau as covered in red hair. As the story goes, Esau sold his birthright as the first-born son to his younger twin, in exchange for a bowl of soup. While the story is intended to demonstrate the hazards of placing material desires over a spiritual blessing, one has to wonder if Esau was simply suffering from the effects of kwashiorkor.  Proopiomelanocortin deficiency (POMC) is a genetic disease resulting in obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair . Children with this genetic disorder exhibit early onset severe obesity and striking red hair, due to the effects the POMC gene has on ACTH production and the influence this gene has on the phaeomelanin:eumelanin ratio in cells.   Redhead Nicknames There are various nicknames used around the world for those who have red hair. Sometimes the nicknames are affectionate, but many of the nicknames are used as insults.  Ranga: An Australian nickname for people with red hair. The word is a shortened version of the word orangutan.  Ginger: A name used for redheads, most commonly used in the U.K. The cartoon series South Park satirized the persecution of redheads with a genocidal campaign against "ginger people."  Carrot Top: A nickname often used in the United States, comparing red hair to the color of carrots.  Koakage: The Japanese word for redheads - the word "akage" indicates the red hair and the prefix "ko" for something small or cute.    The Myth of Redhead Extinction News reports reported on the imminent extinction of redheads in August 2007 . Like many other myths circulating on the internet, the reports were incorrect. Based on the incorrect assumption that recessive genes will "die out" over time, the news reports stated that the gene for red hair would be gone by the year 2060. The reports supposedly came from the Oxford Hair Foundation, but no such scientific entity exists. The Oxford Hair Foundation manufactures beauty products and is not an academic facility. The claim that redheads are going extinct is completely false: recessive genes may become rare, but will not disappear from the human genome. Red hair will exist well beyond the year 2060!

Author Leah Lefler 11 days ago  from Western New York I would love to travel to Alaska one day, Lone Timberwolf. We also live in a low-sun location during the winter (Western NY), but our summers are sunny and typically are in the mid 80's. I have to stay on top of the sunscreen for my children, as their skin is very prone to sunburn. Your hair is beautiful!  Author Leah Lefler 11 days ago  from Western New York Hair color for people with blonde or red hair often darkens with age, as certain genes are switched off and on throughout childhood and puberty. Eumelanin production typically increases with age.  LoneTimberWolf 11 days ago  Aye, livin' in Alaska was a low sun environment during th' winter. but what most don't seem to realize is that it gets into the 90's during th' summer. And thank ye my friends also think My hair and eye combination is quite pretty as well. My profile picture is actually a picture of me, not something I  found on the internet.  shreyash11 11 days ago  will my hair colour get darker as... age by age ??  Author Leah Lefler 12 days ago  from Western New York Shreyash, you could always have your hair dyed to a darker color if you would like to do so.  shreyash11 13 days ago  I am redhead..my hair colour is getting partially dark brown...then What should i do for to make my hair colour darkest brown ..??  Author Leah Lefler 2 weeks ago  from Western New York Shreyash11, it is impossible to say with certainty, but your baby will most likely demonstrate the phenotype of dark hair if you marry someone with dark hair. The child may or may not have the mutations responsible for red hair, but it is likely to be masked by the darker hair. Genetics is tricky to predict (due to crossing-over during meiosis and other intricacies), so you never really know until the child is born.  Author Leah Lefler 2 weeks ago  from Western New York Your parents likely each carry MC1R genetic mutations, Madison - I bet your hair is beautiful! I have brown hair, my husband had very red hair (it is now much darker and appears brown) and my son has strawberry blonde hair that is getting darker with age.  Madison 2 weeks ago  I have red hair and my parents have black and brown hair  shreyash11 2 weeks ago  I am redhead boy...but my parants have typically black hair & if i marry with black hair colourd girl then which hair colour will my baby have ???      Author Leah Lefler 5 weeks ago  from Western New York What a cool combination of rare eye and hair color, Lone Timberwolf! Living in Alaska would definitely be a low-sun environment. We live in Western NY and do not get very much sun, and my pale, red (now brown) haired child does well in the low-sun environment.  LoneTimberWolf 5 weeks ago  I have bright red hair, as does my da, aunt, grandma, and great grandma. We all have the MC1R mutation, and my mother is a carrier, but she had blonde hair and brown eyes. I somehow got amber eyes, though my mom and sisters eyes are brown, and my da's are green. I can tan, with much effort and many sunburn, but I am most comfortable in cold climates with little sun, such as when I lives in alaska. So I got one of the rarest eye colors in the world, and the rarest hair color as well. ^-^  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York Laura, I wanted to add the OTC 23 and Me test only tests for three variants on the MC1R gene. Well over 30 variants are known to cause the red-hair phenotype, so it is quite possible you have a variant not tested by the kit.  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York Hello, Laura - 23 and Me is an over the counter test. If you can buy it online, it is over-the-counter. To have full sequencing of the MC1R gene, you would need a prescription and the oversight of a geneticist. 23 and Me (along with other OTC genetics kits) only look for the most common allele or mutation in most genes.  Laura 2 months ago  Thanks for the reply Leah. It wasnt an over the counter test, i used the 23 and me testing which covers all of them in detail.  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York Hi Laura - there are over 30 different alleles for MC1R, and it is likely that any over the counter genetic testing product only tests for the most common variants. The most likely explanation is that you do have a variant in the MC1R gene that wasn't detected by the test, as most OTC evaluations are produced to find the most common alleles. Another explanation would be that you carry another gene (other than MC1R) that is affecting hair color, though nearly all people with red hair carry a mutation in the MC1R gene. Other genes are suspected of playing a role in hair and skin pigmentation, however, so genetics is a bit more complicated than a Punnett square might suggest.  Author Leah Lefler 2 months ago  from Western New York It is quite possible you either carry or have the gene, philessense. The only way to tell for sure would be genetic testing.  philessense 2 months ago  Mother and 3 sibs are redheads. Father, dark brown w/ blue eyes, fair skin never tanned. Eldest brother and I brown hair with red in it if I try to go blonde. My redheaded sibs consider me dark, as I am able, with much effort, to build a bit of a tan and they can't. But I'm quite pale, burn and blister more easily than normal people. And when I am at my darkest, people tell me I am too pale. I have always assumed I had the red hair gene.  Laura 2 months ago  Hi. I’ve just had genetic testing done and i do not carry the red hair gene. I have dark brown hair. However my partner has red hair and so do both of my children. I thought both parents had to have the gene?      Author Leah Lefler 3 months ago  from Western New York It is so interesting to see the variations in expression with the red-hair gene, Leslie! My children are similar (my husband is a red-head and my oldest is dark blond and my youngest is strawberry blond).  Leslie Yee 3 months ago  My husband is a red head rr (2 recessive red), I am brunette Bb (1 dominant brown, 1 recessive blonde). We have 2 brunette daughters, and one dark blonde daughter. All daughters have one recessive red hair gene.  Catherine Dye 3 months ago  What are the possible hair color types for a child born to one red haired parent and one brunette parent who carries a recessive blonde hair gene? Would it be 50% brunette with a recessive red and 50% strawberry blonde? or would the other 50% just turn out red? What happens when two different colored recessive genes pair up?  Author Leah Lefler 4 months ago  from Western New York I wouldn't be scared, Bree, but I would be careful with regard to tanning and excessive sun exposure. My boys are very fair and we use sunscreen with them whenever they are outside for extended periods (my 11 year old had a scare with a dysplastic mole that showed up on his back at the age of 9 and recurred, so he had to have a wide excision to remove all chance that it could come back). Everyone is different and the only real worry with having both copies of MC1R would be repeated exposure to the sun, increasing the risk of skin cancer. I'm sure you'll be fine as long as you don't sunbathe on a regular basis!  Bree 4 months ago  Im kinda scared after reading that redheads and blonde haired people are likely carriers of cancerous genes. Im the only red head in my blood related family and also the only girl who was born into my family, making me "special" so I hope there is nothing else different. Also, does anyone with medical knowledge know the percentage of red/blonde haired people that have came down with cancer is? Also, does anyone know what age it usually comes by if it is a Dominant gene?  Author Leah Lefler 5 months ago  from Western New York The MC1R genetic mutation is carried by all races, tlew. It is also likely Cleopatra used henna as a beauty agent.  tlew 5 months ago  how was malcom x a redhead? or cleopatra?  Author Leah Lefler 5 months ago  from Western New York It is highly likely you carry the MC1R gene, RTaylor, though only genetic testing would be definitive. My husband has similar traits and we have one child with strawberry hair (which has darkened) and one child with blond hair. Your parents may or may not have red hair, as each one would only need to be a carrier to pass on the red trait, so you could have two parents who don't display the trait. My son and I both have issues with anesthesia, though we also have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (known for a difficulty with anesthesia), so it is hard to determine whether it is the EDS or the red hair gene causing the issues for us!  RTaylor 5 months ago  Fascinating!!  I'm curious and would like some feedback if anyone cares to assume the challenge? I'm adopted,  thus I have zero genetic history that I can share.  However, after reading all the posts, I feel somewhat confident in proclaiming that I am a "True Red" based on the following: 1) red-headed since birth, (various degrees of darkness, but always red) 2) green eyes and sensitive to sunlight 3) heavy freckling but not necessarily "pale-skinned" More "ruddy" looking. I do burn easily and my freckles seem to double if I forget sunscreen. Also have had 3 lesions removed...not melanoma,  but did have some type of cancerous cells. 4) Dx'd with SLE (systemic Lupus) at age 40. It's an auto-immune disorder that causes an increased inflammatory response. 5) This one is the worst by far...on 2 seperate occasions, I woke up during surgery!! I didn't feel pain, but I remember opening my eyes through some kind of guppy lubricant they apply apparently, and thinking...Oh s#!:#!  That's all I remember thank God...the anesthesiologist later explained to me that it was because of my "red-hair gene!" 6) For some weird reason, my body wont dissolve those "dissolvable stitches." Nobody seems to know why? I'm now wondering if this an isolated occurance, or could it be related to the gene? Ok....here's my question?  Is it reasonable to assume that I'm a carrier of the MC1R gene? Husband- brown hair, light green eyes, tans easily. Both my children have dark brown hair with heavy red tints in sunlight. Both light BLUE -eyed, scattered freckles to upper body only. Both O-neg blood type...same as me. Neither have shown evidence of problems with anesthesia thus far. 2nd question (sorry!) Any ideas on what my bio-parents had in terms of hair/eye color?? Thanks for any insight you might be willing to share. It's nice to know I'm not the only one with questions!! Best to you all....  Author Leah Lefler 5 months ago  from Western New York My son is similar, Yadira - he was born with black hair, which fell out and he had red hair until it darkened to brown. We are much farther north than Florida - but his eyes are blue/gray.  Yadira 5 months ago  Oh, I am a mess. I was born with black hair, then it turned lighter almost blond then copperish red, then red(er) and finally dark brown. I got out in the sun and I turn red, earn freckles and go back to be white again. I never get a tan (Sighs) My eyes they can change from blue to gree all in one day or stay green for many years and change into different shades of green. If I travel a bit far up north in the state of Florida where I am and the weather is cold my eyes turn blue.  Author Leah Lefler 6 months ago  from Western New York Hi Jim, is the "red spot" a patch of red hair, or is it a red spot on the skin? Red spots on the skin (macules, papules, and hemangiomas) are not indicative of carrying the recessive red hair gene. If you have a patch of red hair, then you may carry/express the recessive MC1R gene.  Jim 6 months ago  If I have a red spot on the back of my head do I carry recessive red?  Author Leah Lefler 6 months ago  from Western New York The red hair gene exists in many ethnicities, so it is not linked to "green eyes," though there are people who carry both traits at the same time. There is likely a founder effect as many of these traits (Rh negative blood type, green eyes, and red hair) are found at a higher rate in Europe and occur simultaneously in many individuals.  susan sanger 6 months ago  Interesting.  Have you cross-matched red hair, eye color, skin color? So far, the conclusions are very different:  Red hair, green eyes, extreme sensitivity to hot- cold., and RH Negative blood type?  grandma clara  Author Leah Lefler 7 months ago  from Western New York It is interesting, Matthew. We actually had a fertile mule in the Inland Empire of California where I spent my childhood. She had two foals - they named one of the foals "Blue Moon" due to the rarity of a fertile mule!  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  ( http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnews360.c... ) I made a an ignorant claim that, Hybrid Species are "genetic dead ends", this is an article from Wire reprinted from Quanta Magazine, that illustrates the benefit of diversity, and that being a pseudo-scientist is being wrong a lot! lol.  ( Im not sure if linking is allowed, article was found in a aggregator )  Author Leah Lefler 7 months ago  from Western New York I agree, Matthew, that people seem to have become polarized in recent times and we must reach out to our fellow humans to stop hate and to develop relationships that prevent the formation of stereotypes. Never stop learning - this should be the human motto.  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  While trying to find evidence to my argument, i ran across "Christian Forums" really getting disgusting and it just highlighted how stupid today's world is because we as a society are okay with being fed information rather then winning that information for our own good. Ignorance is the bane of Civilization, once we are complacent enough to believe what sounds good we are ignorant enough to vote out our republic.  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  (Bio: I'm a US Army Infantryman, all outsides look the same when they are on the outside, and if we can eliminate hate,fear, and ignorance, then what is there left to fight over, If I can never see Death again due  to misunderstandings I will die happy)Thank you, Preconceived Notions. that was what I was trying to say. Long story short My buddy was telling me he was attracted to Red's, even though he "was" and "we are" supposed to be "disgusted by them," thats when I forgot myself and yelled "conjecture!!!, that's not science nor is it fact, It!! is based on hate stereotypes", and Preconceived notions.  In an attempt to try to correct, in what I believe a intellectual teachable moment and a literal chance to "kill" hate and ignorance, because he rebutted my argument in I believe her because she is in the medical field, even though she has not specialized nor is she a Phd. I'm like awesome, I can prove to you! or.. reference to the fact that is not common knowledge nor is it scientific. Not to mention He could talk to a Herpetologist about his hemorrhoids, but unless He has a cloaca his advice should be taken with understanding that Dr. Herp DVM. is not an expert in that field or discipline and neither is the "Expert".  Author Leah Lefler 7 months ago  from Western New York Matthew, I would first ask the question: is your initial supposition correct? Who finds red-heads unattractive?  Apart from a satirical South Park episode, I haven't heard about hate groups regarding people with red hair, though I suppose there are people who will always find someone to hate. As with all physical characteristics, there are stereotypes applied - which are often inaccurate or serve to validate a preconceived notion. Prejudice is learned and not a genetic trait.  Matthew Grauel 7 months ago  I'm, looking for information about how the "fear of gingers" propagates anecdotal conjecture. The argument: my friend said according to his Niece who purportedly works at John Hopkins for Kids, "We are genetically designed to find red-heads unattractive." My rebuttal: CONJECTURE, more specific Religious Allegory, most recently Vikings dominating Christians from the Dark Ages up until the Late Middle Ages, even surviving the renaissance as the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire. We were taught to Hate and Fear Red  headed pagans, and those fears survive today as stereotypes. I have tried arguing that Hate is a subjective sociological skill, one learns to conform to to be accepted and not be cast out of the "Common People" with the "Common Idea". I tried to bring up Bears, and highlight the difference between biological response to environment and sociological response to society's common idea.  Bears evolved white fur to better hunt on the Ice, those who lived long enough to pass that mutation now propagates the mutation as a dominant, and now the likelihoods of creating white furred hunters are more likely, and a probability. Where does Social come into play? Wolves adopt dogs, Cats adopt Birds. but because they cannot reproduce, in my mind it doesn't apply; Polar Bear and Grizzly Bear are probably close enough to get a mutant like Liger or a Walfin, or a mule, but that line stops as mutants are usually born sterile. Since all Humans possess the MC1R Gene and it can be expressed by any human, and if we are programmed to hate Ginger's, then why don't we hate ourselves for being carriers? Anyone? I'm open minded so critique that crap out of me.  Author Leah Lefler 8 months ago  from Western New York There are a lot of variants, Mickie! Many people with the "red" gene don't display the phenotype if they also have dark hair, but may easily have children with lighter hair where the redness shows through. My husband was a true red-head, but became darker as an adult. He still has a red beard! My oldest boy was blond as a baby, but my youngest son had strawberry blond hair. Both boys are older now and have the same hair color (a dark blond/light brown). In the sunlight, there is still a red hint to my younger son's hair.  Author Leah Lefler 8 months ago  from Western New York My uncle has red hair and has maintained a shade of red well into his 80's! It has lightened considerably, but is definitely still red.  val smith 8 months ago  I am almost 81 years old and have never had to add dye to my hair, but over time the shade does change somewhat and I think this may be because health issues  Mickie Chaplin Boldt 9 months ago  As you stated, there are always anomolies.  My dad had very dark brown hair and light green eyes, almost black and my mom had a beautiful auburn color with brown eyes.  I am the oldest of three -- I have Strawberry Blonde and green eyes, my two bothers were medium brown hair and brown eyes. Not sure of my Dad's side way back, but the immediate family all had shades of brown hair and some with brown eyes and others blue or green.  My mom's side however, had lots of red hair.  My husband's hair is dark brown/black and brown eyes.  My son had Strawberry Blonde when little, but it turned darker, and darker brown as he got older, but he has a reddish brown beard!  Justin Hall 9 months ago  This is bizarre. I have the following alleles with regard to my MC1R gene R160W, D294H, V92M, D84E, V60L and yet I have brown hair. I had blond hair as a child and by the time I was in my mid teens it had darkened to the medium light to medium brown it is today. All I have ever found was an occasional red hair in my beard and even they were few and far in between.  Hernan 10 months ago  Red hair, as any recessive mutation can be diluted (if they reproduce at slower speed than the other hair color populations) but not extinct unless there is a pressure to supress this mutation by selection (Suppression of these people from reproduction). Maybe the % of gingers can be reduced but not eliminated.  kayeff 11 months ago  Did you just make up the "koakage" because I can't find evidence of it's truth anywhere. Akage = redhead and kawaii = cute. Where did you get the koakage idea?  Author Leah Lefler 13 months ago  from Western New York Blond hair may contain pheomelanin, Keep It Red - it does not have to contain this form of melanin, but it certainly can have it.  Author Leah Lefler 13 months ago  from Western New York It is very interesting to me how the beard color will remain red, even when the hair on someone's head has darkened, sbbhunt! My husband still has a very red beard, even though the hair on his head has turned a reddish brown color.  Author Leah Lefler 13 months ago  from Western New York My younger son had red hair as a toddler and it is now darker and nearly the same color as his older brother's hair (a very dark blond/light brown). It is interesting how hair color changes over time, Robert!

My mom has red hair (not auburn) and my dad has brown hair. I have blonde hair and my brother has red hair (slightly more blonde than my moms). How is this possible? I understand how my brother would have gotten his red hair if my dad is carrying a mc1r gene but how would I have blonde hair then? Could my dad be carrying a brown hair, blonde hair and mc1r gene?  keep it red 17 months ago  Okay.  I've been reading and I'm not so sure what I typed a week ago is correct because now I'm finding publications that are saying that pheomelanin IS responsible for blonde hair as well.  Some say yes, some say no.  I would like to know the truth so I'll keep reading.  My apologies to you and again, thanks for the article.  keep it red 17 months ago  Enjoyed this article with the exception of one glaring mistake.  Blonde hair does not cotain pheomelanin, only a bit of eumelanin.  As you stated above, the abscence of any pigment results in white hair, so a little eumelanin makes blonde hair.  It is this bit of eumelanin that gives it it's yellowish or blonde hue.  Blonde hair actually derives from brown hair, not red hair.  So eumelanin is responsible for black, brown, and blonde hair.  Pheomelanin is responsible for all red hair only.  Other than that, great article.  I enjoyed it.  Author Leah Lefler 2 years ago  from Western New York Isn't it interesting, Dolores? One of my children is blond and the other has red hair, and my red-head is very resistant to local anesthetics.  Author Leah Lefler 2 years ago  from Western New York The resistance to anesthetics is a very interesting side effect to the MC1R gene, mbwalz! My boys also have Ehlers Danlos syndrome, which causes resistance to local anesthetics. They have a double whammy, and our trips to the dentist are usually rather difficult (as you can imagine)!  Dolores Monet 2 years ago  from East Coast, United States As the mother of two red headed children, I used to think they were just whiners when they complained of pain. Now I know that they actually are more sensitive! I feel like a hardhearted mama! There seems to be a problem with electricity as well. I never knew two people who complained of electrical shocks like the two of them. Of course, they were such gorgeous kids. There is nothing more adorable than a red-headed child!  MaryBeth Walz 2 years ago  from Maine Thanks for the in depth info about us redheads! I just wrote a hub about our pain and the things that are being discovered through the mutation of the MC1R gene. It could lead, if there's enough interest and funding, in new classes of analgesics. In the mean time, we just get to ask for more lidacaine instead! Voted up and shared!  Author Leah Lefler 4 years ago  from Western New York Perhaps people are jealous of your red hair, Jill?  Jill 4 years ago  People are jealous  of me  I don't know why I'm almost 60  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York That is a good response! I love red hair and I'm glad one of my kids has it (though it is much less obvious now)!  Crystal Tatum 5 years ago  from Georgia Perhaps the best answer, as her parents finally taught my cousin to respond when asked where she got that red hair, is "God gave it to me"!  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York The genetics is interesting to me, Crystal Tatum - it is very possible to carry the red gene and have dark hair - when a child gets two copies of the genetic mutation, they will have red or orange hair. The actual genetics are a bit more complicated than that, of course - there are many different mutations and some are have more penetrance  (i.e. "stronger") than others. I have brown hair (blond as a child) and my husband has red hair - we have one son who has blond/brown hair and one son who has reddish hair.. though the red has become less obvious as he has gotten older and his hair has darkened!  Crystal Tatum 5 years ago  from Georgia The genetics bit was very well written but over my head. I do know that I have a cousin with a brown haired father and black haired mother who came out with orange hair. Apparently there was red hair on both sides of the family back a coulpe of genrations. She's never liked it much ....people were always coming up to her in stores and rubbing her hair! It's hard to believe how barbaric ancient civilizations could be. You did a great job with this hub. Voting up and interesting.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York I love genetics, pinkhawk - many genes have an effect beyond the obvious phenotype of having red hair. The increased skin cancer risk is simply the direct effect of the type of melanin the "red" genes express. Eumelanin protects against the sun's radiation; pheomelanin does not protect the skin.  pinkhawk 5 years ago  from Pearl of the Orient such an interesting topic! ^_^...thanks for sharing!...there's a reason for everything, wondering about its other function...  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York My five year old had very strawberry blond hair as a toddler, Tiffany, and now he is developing darker hair. I suspect he has a "weak" red hair gene or he is only a carrier of the gene. Still, his skin is extremely fair and we go through bucket loads of sunscreen each summer! My husband is a classic red head, and is very susceptible to skin damage from the sun.  tiffany delite 5 years ago  from united states thank you for this very interesting hub. my bestie has red hair and freckles and is so sensitive to the sun just like you said in this article! my hair was lighter when i was younger, and it has gotten darker as i have gotten older...that must mean my genes are slow starters...yes? lol. blessings!  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Redheads are a big part of my life, too - my husband is a redhead and my younger son was strawberry blond. His hair gets darker in the winter, but gets redder in the summer with exposure to the sun. As a toddler and preschooler, he had very reddish hair. My older son was blond as a baby and has brown hair now. You definitely have a life filled with redheads, PaisleeGal!  Pat Materna 5 years ago  from Memphis, Tennessee, USA Well this is a fascinating read. Redheads have always played a part in my life. While my hair is mousy brown I've always loved redhair.  My first love when I was 8 was redheaded. Then when I was 14 my first huge crush was a redhead. I finally married a redhead (not the same guy). My matron of honor at my wedding was redheaded. I was hoping one of my sons would be redheaded like their dad but they ended up like me with brown hair. Two yrs ago I thot my grandson was going to have redhair (his mom was a strawberry blond as a child) but alas so far his hair is not red but is a honey color and when in the sun you can see streaks of reddish.  So redheads have always been a big part of my life  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York It is fascinating, isn't it, Deborah? Since it is recessive, it really does take two carriers to have a child with red hair. My son has strawberry blond hair that has now darkened (but returns to its reddish hue during the summer months). He has the freckles to match, so we go through a lot of sunscreen!  Deborah Neyens 5 years ago  from Iowa Interesting! I'm a red head but never knew the genetics behind it. I'm told my red-headed, Irish great grandmother was bummed that none of her children or grandchildren were red heads, but after she passed, several of us came along in my generation and the next generation.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Current science disputes the theory - DNA has been sequenced from Neanderthal remains and the genetic sequencing shows an entirely different mutation in the MC1R gene than his found in humans - so the likelihood of a "genetic flow" from Neanderthals to homo sapiens is very low.  Tamara Wilhite 5 years ago  from Fort Worth, Texas What do you think of the theory that due to the age of the red haired gene, that it came from Neandertals?  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York I worry about the skin cancer risk, too, Kelly. We recently went to the beach and we used a lot of sunscreen on our boys to keep them from getting sunburned. I suppose forewarning is foreknowledge, and all we can do is use sunscreen and monitor for any skin changes!  Kelly Pittman 5 years ago  from Walker, LA My son is a red head - Or he likes to say it's orange. (He's 7 now)   My husband and I both have dark brown hair and our daughter has light brown hair as I did as a child.  Both sets of my husband and I's grandmothers were red heads so we assume we carried on something, though when someone asked our son, "Where do you get that red hair from?"  He replies, "It grows outta my head."  I do worry about the cancer risk as my grandmother died from a rare case of melanoma.   Nice work on this hub.  Very informative. Voted Up and Interesting.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York My mom had auburn hair, but my sister and I didn't pick up the red shade. I was tickled when Nolan's hair turned a beautiful strawberry blond (from my husband's side). The hair in our family tends to get darker with age, though, so it hides the red! Thanks for the comment, teaches!  Dianna Mendez 5 years ago  My mother had red hair but none her children received this blessing. I had tints of red in my hair,but this was the closest anyone came to red hair. I have to say my mother had the most beautiful color of red, it was a darker shade and thick.  Thanks for posting, I like your matrix on the dominant colors.  Voted up.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Hyphenbird, it is interesting how hair color changes with age. Sometimes the pigment producing cells produce more eumelanin as a person ages, but the gene for red hair is, of course, still there. The red color is just harder to see because it is masked by the darker hair. There are many variants of the MC1R gene that cause varying shades of red, and some are "weak" red genes that don't give the classic "carrot top" color. My husband's hair has darkened considerably, but he still has the freckles and his beard hair is very red!  Brenda Barnes 5 years ago  from America-Broken But Still Beautiful You did a great job and a lot of research on this Hub. My dad was a redhead and so was I as a child. Alas, my hair turned dark as I aged. By the time I was fifteen, it was dark brown. My mom had coal black hair so it was natural to be confused. lol I really was fascinated by your research and commend you.  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York I did simplify the idea, of course - there are many polymorphisms of the MC1R gene that cause red hair, so one parent could easily carry one variant while another parent carries a different allele. And then there is complete vs. partial penetrance, etc. Still, it gives a general idea of how two brown haired parents might end up with a little redhead! Thanks for your comment, DFiduccia  DFiduccia 5 years ago  from Las Vegas Leahlefler, I haven’t seen a Punnett square since I retired from teaching. It brings back memories of Mendel and dominant/ submissive traits. You really got into this hub—great presentation. Voted up—DF  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York Vanderleelie, there were many myths about redheads that fueled hatred and misunderstanding. Some in the Middle Ages believed that children with red hair were conceived while the mother was going through a menstrual cycle. In earlier times, it was believed to be a sign of witchcraft or an unlucky "mark." I am certainly glad my family lives in modern times!  Vanderleelie 5 years ago  This is interesting information.  The fact that redheads are more sensitive to pain is perhaps one reason why they were considered "different" in other time periods. Voted up!  Author Leah Lefler 5 years ago  from Western New York The MC1R gene is here to stay - the same rumors circulated about blond hair going extinct. My younger son's hair is getting darker and the red isn't as obvious in the winter. In the summer, though, he has the most wonderful red hair.  Kimberly Schimmel 5 years ago  from North Carolina, USA I'm so glad red hair is not going extinct.  Hubby and I have red-haired great-aunts and I have a redheaded sister and neice.  Only one of our 6 kids is a redhead, but I'm hoping they all carry the gene on to future generations.

"Redhead" redirects here. For other uses, see Redhead (disambiguation) .     Woman with red hair       Man with red hair    Red hair (or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population . It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. [1]  Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn ) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond . It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin . It is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . [2]  Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered.  The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510.

Redheads today are commonly associated with the Celtic nations [4] and to a far lesser extent the Germanic peoples.  In Ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is estimated to be at around 10%, [5] making it the most red-haired country in the world. According to Britain's DNA, 34.7% of the Irish population carry the allele for red hair, although this doesn't directly translate proportionally into births of red-haired children. [6]  Scotland also has a very high percentage with around 6% of the population having red hair. [7] [8] Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA study used a sample of 2,343 people, and found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, with 35% overall carrying the allele and Edinburgh having the highest proportion at 40%. [7] [8] [9] The largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. [10]  England has a red hair prevalence of around 4%, with 28.5% of population having the allele; [7] while in Wales 38% of Welsh people carry the red-haired allele. [7] A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits from Great Britain found higher levels of red hair in Wales and the Scottish border counties of England . [fn 1] [11]  Eastern and Southern Europe     A Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale , c. 30 BC    Carleton Coon's 1939 book The Races of Europe stated that rufosity (reddish hair) often occurred in Montenegrins . [12] [13] [14]  In Italy , red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. [15] In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. [15]  Victorian era  ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga to be "the most red-headed men in the world", [16] a claim which has a solid basis even today, as the Volga region has more redheads per population than anywhere else in the world with the exception of Ireland . [17]  North Africa and Mediterranean      Hades abducting Persephone , fresco in the small royal tomb at Vergina , Macedonia, Greece , c. 340 BC    The Berber populations of Morocco [18] and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, [19] [20] [21] respectively. The Queen of Morocco , Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI , has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. [22] In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. [23] Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards . [24] In European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition , all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. [25] In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. [27] The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. [28]  Asia (all regions)     A Uyghur girl in Kashgar , China 's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair    In Asia, genetic red hair is rare, but reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair can be found in the Levant ( Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine ), in Turkey , in Caucasia , in Northern Kazakhstan , among Uyghurs and among Indo-Iranians . [ editorializing ] The use of henna on hair and skin for various reasons occasionally occurs in Asia. When henna is used on hair it dyes the hair to different shades of red. [29] [30]  Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa  Emigration from Europe has multiplied the population of red haired humans in the Americas , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In the United States , it is estimated that 2–6% of the population has red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 420,000 in Ireland and 300,000 in Scotland. [7]  Historical     Woman with mixed reddish-brown hair, Papua New Guinea . Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair. [31]    Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. [32] The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red-haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. [33] [34]  In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians , who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China . Caucasian  Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC . [35]  Reddish-brown ( auburn ) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians , and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. [36] [37]  Biochemistry and genetics     A close-up view of red hair        Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum , made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii).    The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.  The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome  16 . Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer.  The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is unable to tan . Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not all-inclusive feature of red-haired people. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant [2] .  Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.  Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production. [38]  Genetics  The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His , and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. [39] The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA ) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. [40] [41]  In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.  Evolution  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. [42] In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift . [39]  Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. [43] [44]  A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans. [45]  Extinction hoax  See also: Disappearing blonde gene  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail , which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. [46] Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble , and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away". [47]  Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future. [47]  Medical implications of the red hair gene  Melanoma  Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning , but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage . Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. [48] It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. [49]  Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [50] [51]  Pain tolerance and injury  Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), [52] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. [53] [54] [55]  Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic . [56] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. [57] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide . [55]  The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins . (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC , and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. [58] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin , but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. [58] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.  There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. [59] [60] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising . [60]  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:   In cases of severe malnutrition , normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde . The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor , is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine .  One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea , results in red hair and red-colored skin. [61]  Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin . [61] [62]   Culture     Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum , late 1st-century BC to mid-1st century AD [63]       Polychrome Roman marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum    In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.      Portrait of a Lady , ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli        Elizabeth I of England , ca. 1588    Beliefs about temperament  A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables , a character says of Anne Shirley , the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye , Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair."  During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament . [64] In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda , redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.  Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels , "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms ," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that "neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo ] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe". [65] Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero . They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads. [66]  Media, fashion and art     "The Accolade" by Edmund Blair Leighton    Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman , Alyson Hannigan , Marcia Cross , Christina Hendricks , Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. [ citation needed ]  Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India , Iran , Bangladesh and Pakistan , henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance. [67]  Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color " Titian " takes its name from the artist Titian , who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli 's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites , Edmund Leighton , Modigliani , [68] and Gustav Klimt . [69]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes story " The Red-Headed League " (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor .  Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Red Sonja , Mystique , and Poison Ivy . [70]  Prejudice and discrimination against redheads  Medieval beliefs      Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral    Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers ( Der Eisenhans ) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper , in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk . [71]  Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum , [72] notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch , a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;   Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn. But these men were called Typhonians, and were representatives not of Osiris but of his evil rival Typhon, whose hair was red.   Medieval antisemitism      Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd'    During the Spanish Inquisition , people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. [25] In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus , and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. [26] Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin . [27] The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. [28] The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David . The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau , even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'. [73]  Modern-day discrimination  "Carrot head" redirects here. For the French novel, see Poil de carotte .  In his 1885 book I Say No , Wilkie Collins wrote "The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair."  In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham , Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: "The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, "Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head," and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man." [74]  In British English , the word "ginger" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), [75] with terms such as "gingerphobia" [76] and "gingerism" [77] used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as "carrot tops" and "carrot heads". (The comedian " Carrot Top " uses this stage name .) "Gingerism" has been compared to racism , although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. [77]  Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for "being ginger". [78] In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; [79] in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne , was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair. [80] In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. [81] In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him "just because he had red hair". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. [82]  This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show . The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp , who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. [83] The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis ) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. [84] [85] ) Comedian Tim Minchin , himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song "Prejudice". [86]  The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the " Ginger Kids ", " Le Petit Tourette ", " It's a Jersey Thing " and " Fatbeard " episodes of South Park .  Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. [87] However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; "Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd," says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons . [88]  In Australian slang , redheads are often nicknamed "Blue" or "Bluey". [89] More recently, they have been referred to as "rangas" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. [90] The word "rufus" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; [91] based on a variant of rufous , a reddish-brown color.  In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a "National Kick a Ginger Day" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. [92]  In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words: " Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones " after customers complained the card was offensive. [93]  In October 2010, Harriet Harman , the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a "ginger rodent". [94] Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was "proud to be ginger". [95] Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. [96]  In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks , announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination . [97]  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo ( Chinese : 红毛 ; pinyin : hóng máo ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : âng-mo͘ ) in Hokkien ( Min Nan ) Chinese means "red-haired", [98] and is used in Malaysia and Singapore to refer to white people. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui ( 红毛鬼 ) meaning "red-haired devil", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo ("foreign devil"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. [99] Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. [100] Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times , [101] and in television programmes and films.  The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō ( 紅毛 ), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku , its 200-year period of isolation. [102]  Red hair festivals     Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day , September 2007    There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival is paid for by the local government in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands. [103] It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. Today, the festival includes music, fashion shows, art exhibitions and a picnic [104]  The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. [105]  A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. [106]  Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot) , held for the local Israeli red hair community, [107] including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. [108] However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. [109] The organizers state; "The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.” [109]  The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. [110]  Religious and mythological traditions  In the Iliad , Achilles ' hair is described as ξανθῆς [111] ( ksanthēs ) , usually translated as blonde, or golden [112] but sometimes as red or tawny. [113] [114] His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. [115]  The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. [116]     Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys    The Hebrew word usually translated "ruddy" or "reddish-brown" ( admoni  אדמוני , from the root ADM אדם , see also Adam and Edom ) [117] [118] [119] [120] was used to describe both Esau and David .  Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.  Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture [121] [122] and in the works of William Shakespeare , [123] reinforcing the negative stereotype.

The RedHeads Red Hair Genetics RedTracer DNA Test Order RedTracer DNA Test All about Red Hair Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy About Us Contact Us           Red Hair Genetics Since both copies of your MC1R gene need to be the red hair versions ( rr ) to become a redhead, the following possible situations can result in redheaded offspring: 1. Both parents are carriers. As shown in this punnett square , father (yellow) and mother (pink) contribute one of two possible alleles ( R or r ) of the MC1R variants to the baby. As a result, there is a 25% chance that any of their child will inherit two r alleles from each parents and will be a redhead. R r R RR Rr r Rr rr 2. One parent (e.g., mother) is a redhead and the father is a carrier. In this case, every child will inherit one r allele from their mother and has an equal chance of inheriting the R or r allele from the father. Therefore, the chance of each child being redheaded is 50/50. R r r Rr rr r Rr rr 3. If both parents have red hair, then all offspring will be red headed ( rr ). r r r rr rr r rr rr If one of the parent does not carry the red hair ( r ) allele , then no matter what the other parent's genotype ( RR , Rr , or rr ), none of their children will have red hair. Although some kids will be red hair carriers if they inherit a r allele. R R r Rr Rr r Rr Rr Preserving the Red Hair Trait The myth that redheads might die off in the near future has drawn considerable attentions. Due to the recessive nature of the red hair r allele, it takes 2 carriers ( Rr ) to have a red-headed child. With the increase of globalization and inter-ethnic mixing in marriage, it is reasonable to expect that the chance of 2 red hair carriers getting married and bearing children would be declining. When a red hair carrier marries to a non-carrier, their children are not red headed, but some will carry the red hair r allele. The frequency of the r alleles in the population in fact remains constant. We cannot easily tell if a person is a red hair carrier ( Rr ) without examining his/her extended family members' hair colors or analyzing his/her MC1R gene. Therefore, it is not possible to get a good estimate of the population of red hair carriers ( Rr ). However, we can reasonably expect the population of red hair carriers is much greater than that of the redheads. Even though there is no redhead in your immediate family, the chance that you are a carrier ( Rr ) is still quite high. It is estimated that as many as one in four Caucasians in the US might be a red hair carrier. Our RedTracer DNA Test can help you uncover whether you carry any of the red hair causing variants.
