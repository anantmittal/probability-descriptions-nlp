        population. Suppose further that we compute a statistic (e.g., a mean, proportion, standard deviation) for each 
        sample. The probability 
	    distribution of this statistic is called a sampling distribution . And
        the standard deviation of this statistic is called the standard error .  Variability of a Sampling Distribution  The variability of a sampling distribution is measured by its variance or its standard deviation .  The variability of a sampling
        distribution depends on three factors:   N: The number of observations in the population.  n: The number of observations in the sample.  The way that the random sample is chosen.   If the population size is much larger than the sample size, then the sampling 
        distribution has roughly the same standard error, whether we sample with or without replacement . On the other hand, if the sample represents a 
        significant fraction (say, 1/20) of the population size, the standard error 
        will be meaningfully smaller, when we sample without replacement.  Sampling Distribution of the Mean  Suppose we draw all possible samples of size n from a population of size N . 
        Suppose further that we compute a mean score for each sample. In this way, we 
        create a sampling distribution of the mean.  We know the following about the sampling distribution of the mean.  
        The mean of the sampling distribution (μ x ) 
        is equal to the mean of the population (μ). 
        And the standard error of the sampling distribution (σ x ) 
        is determined by the standard deviation of the population (σ), 
        the population size (N), and the sample size (n). These relationships are shown in the 
        equations below:  μ x = μ σ x = [ σ / sqrt(n) ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  In the standard error formula, the factor sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ] is called the finite population correction or fpc. 
        When the population size is very large relative to the sample size, the fpc is approximately
        equal to one; and the standard error formula can be approximated by:  σ x = σ / sqrt(n).  You often see this "approximate" formula in introductory statistics texts. As a general rule, it is 
            safe to use the approximate formula when the sample size is no bigger than 1/20 of the 
            population size.  Sampling Distribution of the Proportion  In a population of size N , suppose that the probability of the occurrence 
        of an event (dubbed a "success") is P; and the probability of the event's 
        non-occurrence (dubbed a "failure") is Q. From this population, suppose that we 
        draw all possible samples of size n . And finally, within each sample, 
        suppose that we determine the proportion of successes p and failures q . 
        In this way, we create a sampling distribution of the proportion.  We find that the mean of the sampling distribution of the proportion (μ p ) 
        is equal to the probability of success in the population (P). And the standard 
        error of the sampling distribution (σ p ) 
        is determined by the standard deviation of the population (σ), 
        the population size, and the sample size. These relationships are shown in the 
        equations below:  μ p = P  σ p = [ σ / sqrt(n) ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  where σ = sqrt[ PQ ].  Like the formula for the standard error of the mean, the formula for the standard error of the
        proportion uses the finite population correction, sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]. 
        When the population size is very large relative to the sample size, the fpc is approximately
        equal to one; and the standard error formula can be approximated by:  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ]  You often see this "approximate" formula in introductory statistics texts. As a general rule, it is 
            safe to use the approximate formula when the sample size is no bigger than 1/20 of the 
            population size.           Central Limit Theorem  The central limit theorem states that the 
        sampling distribution of the mean of any independent , random variable will be normal or nearly normal, 
        if the sample size is large enough.  How large is "large enough"? The answer depends on two factors.   Requirements for accuracy. The more 
            closely the sampling distribution needs to resemble a normal distribution, 
            the more sample points will be required.  The shape of the underlying population. The more closely the 
            original population resembles a normal distribution, the fewer sample points will
            be required.   In practice, some statisticians say that a sample size of 30 is large enough
        when the population distribution is roughly bell-shaped. Others recommend a sample 
        size of at least 40. But if the original population is distinctly not normal 
        (e.g., is badly skewed, has multiple peaks, and/or has outliers), researchers
        like the sample size to be even larger.   How to Choose Between T-Distribution and Normal Distribution   The t distribution and the normal distribution can both
        be used with statistics that have a bell-shaped distribution. This suggests that we might use either the t-distribution
        or the normal distribution to analyze sampling distributions. Which should we choose?  Guidelines exist to help you make that choice. Some focus on the population standard deviation.   If the population standard deviation is known, use the normal distribution  If the population standard deviation is unknown, use the t-distribution.   Other guidelines focus on sample size.   If the sample size is large, use the normal distribution. (See the 
            discussion above in the section on the Central Limit Theorem to understand what is meant
            by a "large" sample.)  If the sample size is small, use the t-distribution.   In practice, researchers employ a mix of the above guidelines. On this site, we use the normal
        distribution when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large.
        We might use either distribution when standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is very large. 
        We use the t-distribution when the sample size is small, unless the underlying 
        distribution is not normal. The t distribution should not be used with small samples from populations 
        that are not approximately normal.       Test Your Understanding  In this section, we offer two examples that illustrate how sampling distributions are used 
        to solve commom statistical problems. In each of these problems, the population standard deviation is 
        known; and the sample size is large. So you can use the Normal Distribution 
        Calculator, rather than the t-Distribution Calculator, to compute probabilities for these problems.   Normal Distribution Calculator  The normal calculator solves common statistical problems, based on the normal 
	    distribution. The calculator computes cumulative probabilities, based on three 
	    simple inputs. Simple instructions guide you to an accurate solution, quickly 
	    and easily. If anything is unclear, frequently-asked questions and sample 
	    problems provide straightforward explanations. The  
		calculator is free. It can found in the Stat Trek
        main menu under the Stat Tools tab. Or you can tap the button below.  Normal Distribution Calculator   Would it be wrong to use the t-distribution when you know the population standard deviation and the sample
        size is large? Not at all. When the sample size is large, the t-distribution and the normal distribution
        yield approximately the same results.  Example 1  Assume that a school district has 10,000 6th graders. In this district, the 
        average weight of a 6th grader is 80 pounds, with a standard deviation of 20 
        pounds. Suppose you draw a random sample of 50 students. What is the 
        probability that the average weight of a sampled student will be less than 75 
        pounds?  Solution: To solve this problem, we need to define the sampling 
        distribution of the mean. Because our sample size is greater than 
        30, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution will 
        approximate a normal distribution.  To define our normal distribution, we need to know both the mean of the sampling 
        distribution and the standard deviation. Finding the mean of the sampling 
        distribution is easy, since it is equal to the mean of the population. Thus, 
        the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to 80.  The standard deviation of the sampling distribution can be computed using the 
        following formula.  σ x = [ σ / sqrt(n) ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ] σ x = [ 20 / sqrt(50) ] * sqrt[ (10,000 - 50 ) / (10,000 - 1) ] σ x = (20/7.071) * (0.995) = 2.81  Let's review what we know and what we want to know. We know that the sampling 
    distribution of the mean is normally distributed with a mean of 80 and a 
    standard deviation of 2.81. We want to know the probability that a sample mean 
    is less than or equal to 75 pounds.  Because we know the population standard
    deviation and the sample size is large, we'll use the normal distribution to find
    probability. To solve the problem, we plug these inputs 
    into the Normal Probability Calculator: mean = 80, standard deviation = 2.81, 
    and normal random variable = 75. The Calculator tells us that the probability that the average 
    weight of a sampled student is less than 75 pounds is equal to 0.038.  Note: Since the population size is more than 20 times greater than the sample size,
        we could have used the "approximate" formula σ x = [ σ / sqrt(n) ]
        to compute the standard error. Had we done that, we would have found a standard error equal to 
        [ 20 / sqrt(50) ] or 2.83.  Example 2  Find the probability that of the next 120 births, no more than 40% will be 
        boys. Assume equal probabilities for the births of boys and girls.  Assume
        also that the number of births in the population (N) is very large, essentially
        infinite.  Solution: The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the proportion of boys 
        in 120 births will be approximately normally distributed.  The mean of the sampling distribution will be equal to the mean of the 
        population distribution. In the population, half of the births result in boys; 
        and half, in girls. Therefore, the probability of boy births in the population 
        is 0.50. Thus, the mean proportion in the sampling distribution should also be 
        0.50.  The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (i.e., the standard error) can be computed using the 
        following formula.  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  Here, the finite population correction is equal to 1.0, since the population
        size (N) was assumed to be infinite. Therefore, standard error formula reduces to:  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ] σ p = sqrt[ (0.5)(0.5)/120 ] = sqrt[0.25/120 ] = 0.04564  Let's review what we know and what we want to know. We know that the sampling 
        distribution of the proportion is normally distributed with a mean of 0.50 and 
        a standard deviation of 0.04564. We want to know the probability that no more 
        than 40% of the sampled births are boys.  Because we know the population standard
        deviation and the sample size is large, we'll use the normal distribution to find
        probability. To solve the problem, we plug these 
        inputs into the Normal Probability Calculator: mean = .5, standard deviation = 
        0.04564, and the normal random variable = .4. The Calculator tells us that the probability that no 
        more than 40% of the sampled births are boys is equal to 0.014.  Note: This problem can also be treated as a binomial experiment . Elsewhere, we showed how to analyze a binomial experiment . The binomial experiment
        is actually the more exact analysis. It produces a probability 
        of 0.018 (versus a probability of 0.14 that we found using the normal distribution).  Without a computer, 
        the binomial approach is computationally demanding. Therefore,
        many statistics texts emphasize the approach presented above,
        which uses the normal distribution to approximate the binomial.               Bestsellers Handheld Calculators Updated daily 1.

How to Find the Sample Mean  Variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean  Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean     Sample Mean Symbol The sample mean symbol is x̄, pronounced “x bar”. What is the Sample Mean? The sample mean is an average value found in a sample.  A sample is just a small part of a whole. For example, if you work for polling company and want to know how much people pay for food a year, you aren’t going to want to poll over 300 million people. Instead, you take a fraction of that 300 million (perhaps a thousand people); that fraction is called a sample.  The mean is another word for “average.” So in this example, the sample mean would be the average amount those thousand people pay for food a year. The sample mean is useful because it allows you to estimate what the whole population is doing, without surveying everyone. Let’s say your sample mean for the food example was $2400 per year. The odds are, you would get a very similar figure if you surveyed all 300 million people. So the sample mean is a way of saving a lot of time and money. Sample Mean Formula The sample mean formula is: x̄ = ( Σ x i ) / n If that looks complicated, it’s simpler than you think. Remember the formula to find an “average” in basic math? It’s the exact same thing, only the notation (i.e. the symbols) are just different. Let’s break it down into parts:  x̄ just stands for the “sample mean”  Σ means “add up”  x i “all of the x-values”  n means “the number of items in the sample”  Now it’s just a matter of plugging in numbers that you’re given and solving using arithmetic (there’s no algebra required–you can basically plug this in to any calculator).  Back to Top  How to Find the Sample Mean Watch the video or read the steps below:  How to Find the Sample Mean: Overview Dividing the sum by the number of items to find the mean. Finding the sample mean is no different from finding the average of a set of numbers. In statistics you’ll come across slightly different notation than you’re probably used to, but the math is exactly the same. The formula to find the sample mean is:  = ( Σ x i ) / n. All that formula is saying is add up all of the numbers in your data set ( Σ means “add up” and x i means “all the numbers in the data set). This article tells you how to find the sample mean by hand (this is also one of the AP Statistics formulas ). However, if you’re finding the sample mean, you’re probably going to be finding other descriptive statistics, like the sample variance or the interquartile range so you may want to consider finding the sample mean in Excel or other technology. Why? Although the calculation for the mean is fairly simple, if you use Excel then you only have to enter the numbers once. After that, you can use the numbers to find any statistic: not just the sample mean. How to Find the Sample Mean: Steps Sample Question: Find the sample mean for the following set of numbers: 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 40, 43, 55, 56, 67, 78, 78, 79, 80, 81, 90, 99, 101, 102, 304, 306, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405. Step 1: Add up all of the numbers : 12 + 13 + 14 + 16 + 17 + 40 + 43 + 55 + 56 + 67 + 78 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 90 + 99 + 101 + 102 + 304 + 306 + 400 + 401 + 403 + 404 + 405 = 3744 . Step 2: Count the numbers of items in your data set . In this particular data set there are 26 items. Step 3: Divide the number you found in Step 1 by the number you found in Step 2. 3744/26 = 144. That’s it! Tip: If you have to show working out on a test, just place the two numbers into the formula. Step 1 gives you the σ and Step 2 gives you n:  x = ( Σ x i ) / n = 3744/26 = 144 Back to Top  Variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean central limit theorem The Mean of the Sampling Distribution of the Mean Watch the video or read the article below: A sampling distribution where the mean = 6. Image: U of Oklahoma The sampling distribution of the sample mean is a probability distribution of all the sample means. Let’s say you had 1,000 people, and you sampled 5 people at a time and calculated their average height. If you kept on taking samples (i.e. you repeated the sampling a thousand times), eventually the mean of all of your sample means will:  Equal the population mean , μ  Look like a normal distribution curve.   Note : The proof of these facts is beyond any elementary statistics course, but you can see the proof here . The variance of this probability distribution gives you an idea of how spread out your data is around the mean . The larger the sample size, the more closely the sample mean will represent the population mean . In other words, as N grows larger, the variance becomes smaller. Ideally, when the sample mean matches the population mean, the variance will equal zero. The formula to find the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean is: σ 2 M = σ 2 / N, where: σ 2 M = variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. σ 2 = population variance . N = your sample size. Sample question: If a random sample of size 19 is drawn from a population distribution with standard deviation α = 20 then what will be the variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean? Step 1: Figure out the population variance . Variance is the standard deviation squared, so: σ 2 = 20 2 = 400. Step 2: Divide the variance by the number of items in the sample. This sample has 19 items, so: 400 / 19 = 21.05. That’s it! Back to Top Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean Watch the video or read the article below: How to Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean: Overview Standard error for the sample mean, “s.” The standard error of the mean of a sample is equal to the standard deviation for the sample . The difference between standard error and standard deviation is that with standard deviations you use population data (i.e. parameters ) and with standard errors you use data from your sample. You can calculate standard error for the sample mean using the formula: SE = s/√(n) SE = standard error, s = the standard deviation for your sample and n is the number of items in your sample. Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean: Steps Example: Find the standard error for the following heights (in cm): Jim (170.5), John (161), Jack (160), Freda (170), Tai (150.5). Step 1: Find the mean (the average ) of the data set: (170.5 + 161 + 160 + 170 + 150.5) / 5 = 162.4. Step 2: Calculate the deviation from the mean by subtracting each value from the mean you found in Step 1. 170.5 – 162.4 = -8.1 161 – 162.4 = 1.4 160 – 162.4 = 2.4 170 – 162.4 = -7.6 150.5 – 162.4 = 11.9 Step 3: Square the numbers you calculated in Step 2: -8.1 * -8.1 = 65.61 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 2.4 * 2.4 = 5.76 -7.6 * -7.6 = 57.76 11.9 * 11.9 = 141.61 Step 4: Add the values you calculated in Step 3: 65.61 + 1.96 + 5.76 + 57.76 + 141.61 = 272.7 Step 5: Divide the number you found in Step 4 by your sample size – 1 . There are five items in the sample, so n-1 = 4: 272.7 / 4 = 68.175. Step 6: Take the square root of the number you found in Step 5. This is your standard deviation. √(68.175) = 8.257 Step 6: Divide the number you calculated in Step 6 by the square root of the sample size (in this sample problem, the sample size is 5): 8.257 / √(5) = 8.257 / 2.236 = 3.693 That’s how to calculate the standard error for the sample mean! Tip: If you’re asked to find the “standard error” for a sample, in most cases you’re finding the sample error for the mean using the formula SE = s/&sqrt;n. There are different types of standard error though (i.e. for proportions), so you may want to make sure you’re calculating the right statistic.

        normal populations  describe the distribution of the sample mean for samples obtained from 
        a population that is not normal    For a quick overview of this section, feel free to watch this short video summary:   Sampling Distributions  Consider the following three news items.   The average price of unleaded regular fell by 1.6 cents to $3.667
          a gallon on Saturday, from $3.683 a gallon, according to survey
          results from the motorist group AAA. (Source: CNNMoney.com )  The Census Bureau on Tuesday released the 2007 American
          Community Survey, the government's annual estimates of
          social, economic and housing characteristics for the nation. Among the
          highlights: 25.3 - In minutes, the average commute to work in 2007 ,
          an increase from 25.0 minutes in 2006. (Source: Chicago
            Tribune )  Barack Obama leads John McCain, 49% to 44% , when registered
          voters are asked who they would vote for if the election were held today,
          according to the latest Gallup
            Poll Daily tracking update. (Source: Gallup )   All three of these are estimates based on samples In fact, they're probably not correct, due to sampling error. From Section 1.4 ,  Sampling error is the error that results from using a sample to estimate        information regarding a population.  The idea is this - unless we sample every single individual in the sample, there will be some error in our results. Our goal in this section will be to characterize the distribution of the sample mean.  The Distribution of the Sample Mean  Let's look again at the definition of a random variable , from Section 6.1 .  A random variable is a numerical measure of the outcome of a probability
        experiment whose value is determined by chance.  Think about the sample mean, . Isn't it's value determined by chance as well? Since we the individuals in a sample are randomly selected, the sample mean will depend on those individuals selected, so it, too, is a random variable. The big question, then, is the distribution of - in other words, what are its mean (the mean of the sample mean, ) and its standard deviation (the standard deviation of the sample mean, )?  To investigate these, let's look at a particular population.  Consider the heights of the players from the starting line-up from the 2008 Men's Olympic Basketball gold medal game - Jason Kidd (76"), LeBron James (80"), Kobe Bryant (78"), Carmelo Anthony (78"), and Dwight Howard (83"). (Source: NBC Sports ) The mean of the population is 79", with a standard deviation of 2.37"  First, let's consider the different samples of size 2. There are 10 such samples ( 5 C 2 = 10), shown below, along with their corresponding sample means.     sample  heights     Kidd, James  76, 80  78    Kidd, Bryant  76, 78  77    Kidd, Anthony  76, 78  77    Kidd, Howard  76, 83  79.5    James, Bryant  80, 78  79    James, Anthony  80, 78  79    James, Howard  80, 83  81.5    Bryant, Anthony  78, 78  78    Bryant, Howard  78, 83  80.5    Anthony, Howard  78, 83  80.5     Interestingly, the mean of the sample means of size 2 is 79" as well. This is actually reasonable, though, because we know that the mean of a random variable is also its expected value , and it makes perfect sense that the value we should expect from the sample mean is the same as the population mean!  The standard deviation, though, is very different. It helps to look at things visually. The image below represents all possible sample means for samples of size 1 (individuals), 2, 3, 4, and 5 (the population). Pay particular attention to the standard deviation.   The interesting things to note here are that = 79, regardless of the sample size, but the standard deviation decreases as n increases. If we think about this a bit, this too, is reasonable. The more individuals we have in our sample, the more likely we are to be closer to the true mean. Things brings us to our first major point.   The Law of Large Numbers  As n increases, the difference between and μ approaches zero.   We're now ready to investigate the standard deviation of a bit more in-depth.  The Central Limit Theorem   The Central Limit Theorem  Regardless of the distribution shape of the population, the sampling distribution of becomes approximately normal as the sample size n increases (conservatively n≥30).   This is very interesting! So it doesn't matter if the distribution shape was left-skewed, right-skewed, uniform, binomial, anything - the distribution of the sample mean will always become normal as the sample size increases. What an amazing result!  Exploring the Distribution of the Sample Mean  To do some exploring yourself, go to the Demonstrations Project from Wolfram Research, and download the Central Limit Theorem demonstration . If you haven't already, download and install the player by clicking on the image to the right.  Once you have the player installed and the Central Limit Theorem demonstration downloaded, move the slider for the sample size to get a sense of its affect on the distribution shape. You can also move the new sample slider to get a different sample.   The Distribution of the Sample Mean  We can even be more specific about the distribution of :   The Sampling Distribution of  If a simple random sample of size n is drawn from a large population with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the sampling distribution of will have mean and standard deviation:      and      where is the standard error of the mean .  Key fact: If the population is normally distributed, then the sample mean will be normally distributed, regardless of the sample size.   Now let's apply this distribution to various problems.  Using the Central Limit Theorem  In order to find probabilities about a normal random variable, we need to first know its mean and standard deviation. With the results of the Central Limit Theorem, we now know the distribution of the sample mean, so let's try using that in some examples.  Let's see a couple examples.   Example 1   Let's consider again the distribution of IQs that we looked at in Example 1 in Section 7.1.  We saw in that example that tests for an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) are designed to be normally distributed, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.  What is the probability that a randomly selected sample of 20 individuals would have a mean IQ of more than 105?  Solution:  To answer this question, we need to find P( > 105), if n = 20. Before we can do that, we need to first find the distribution of . From the distribution of the sample mean, we know and .  Here's what the distribution of looks like in relation to the distribution of X.   Now that we have the standard deviation, we can find the probability. Using StatCrunch...     Example 2   Source: stock.xchng  In Example 2 in Section 7.1, we were told that weights of 1-year-old boys are approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 22.8 lbs and a standard deviation of about 2.15. (Source: About.com )  Suppose the sample mean of the 10 1-year-old boys at the Kiddie Care day care center is 22.3 lbs. Is that unusual?  Solution:  In order to determine if an event is unusual , we need to find its probability. If the probability of the event is less than 5%, we can classify it as an unusual event.  In this case, we want to find the probability of observing a sample mean of 22.3 or less. Using the distribution of the sample mean, and . Using StatCrunch...   So we'd observe a sample mean of 22.3 lbs or less from a sample of 10 1-year-old boys about 23% of the time, which is not very unusual at all.    Here's one for you to try:   Example 3   Suppose that a particular professor's Statistics exam on probability traditionally has a mean score of 74, with a standard deviation of 11.  The professor suspects that his current crop of students is very strong. To compare, he gives them the same exam he has in the past. The sample mean of the 28 students in his current class was a 78.  Was the professor correct? Is his current class of students unusual compared to those from the past?  [ reveal answer ]   Like the previous example, we need to find the probability of our event in order to determine if it was unusual.  Using the distribution of the sample mean, we know that and . Using StatCrunch...   Since the probability of observing a class of 28 students with an average score of 78 is less than 0.05, it does look like this particular class is unusual.

Define the sample maximum:  $$ M = \max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) $$  Some simulations I've done (see the R code below) seem to indicate that the probability of observing a value as extreme, or more extreme, than the sample maximum is approximately $1/n$ (is this true?).  Specifically the simulations indicate that  $$ E \big(1 - F(M) \big) \approx \frac{1}{n} $$  The fact that, for example, the maximum from a sample of size 1000 should basically be a 1 in 1000 shot agrees with my intuition but I'm having trouble deriving this mathematically.  Any advice on this is appreciated.  set.seed(15435)

So you assume further that the rv's have a continuous distribution, therefore the maximum value is unique with probability 1.
So the problem is symmetric in the variables, i.e. for
each $1\leq k \leq n$ the probability that 
$$ P(X_k=\max(X_1,\ldots,X_n))=c $$
with $c$ constant. Since the probabilities sum up to unity, you get immediately $c=1/n$. Now this means further if you have $n$ values from $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ and you get a further value $X_{n+1}$ the probability that it is larger than all values before is $1/(n+1)$.  The field of probability theory concerned with such questions is called Extreme Value Theory .

Here’s what the Central Limit Theorem is saying, graphically. The picture below shows one of the simplest types of test: rolling a fair die . The more times you roll the die , the more likely the shape of the distribution of the means tends to look like a normal distribution graph . Photo credit:cmglee|Wikimedia Commons  The Central Limit Theorem and Means An essential component of the Central Limit Theorem is that the average of your sample means will be the population mean . In other words, add up the means from all of your samples, find the average and that average will be your actual population mean. Similarly, if you find the average of all of the standard deviations in your sample , you’ll find the actual standard deviation for your population. It’s a pretty useful phenomenon that can help accurately predict characteristics of a population . Watch a video explaining this phenomenon, or read more about it here: The Mean of the Sampling Distribution of the Mean . Central Limit Theorem Examples . A Central Limit Theorem word problem will most likely contain the phrase “assume the variable is normally distributed ”, or one like it. With these central limit theorem examples, you will be given:  A population (i.e. 29-year-old males, seniors between 72 and 76, all registered vehicles, all cat owners)  An average (i.e. 125 pounds, 24 hours, 15 years, $15.74)  A standard deviation (i.e. 14.4lbs, 3 hours, 120 months, $196.42)  A sample size (i.e. 15 males, 10 seniors, 79 cars, 100 households)  Click the link to skip down to one of three central limit theorem examples:  I want to find the probability that the mean is greater than a certain number  I want to find the probability that the mean is less than a certain number  I want to find the probability that the mean is between a certain set of numbers either side of the mean  Central Limit Theorem Examples: Greater than For Central Limit Theorem word problems that contain the phrase “greater than” (or a similar phrase such as “above”).   1. General Steps  Step 1: Identify the parts of the problem . Your question should state:  the mean (average or μ)  the standard deviation (σ)  population size  sample size (n)  a number associated with “greater than” ( ). Note : this is the sample mean . In other words, the problem is asking you “What is the probability that a sample mean of x items will be greater than this number?  Step 2:  Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area roughly above (i.e. the “greater than” area). This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for. Step 3:  Use the following formula to find the z-score . Plug in the numbers from step 1. Click here if you want easy, step-by-step instructions for solving this formula.  Subtract the mean (μ in step 1) from the ‘greater than’ value ( in step 1). Set this number aside for a moment. Divide the standard deviation (σ in step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in step 1). For example, if thirty six children are in your sample and your standard deviation is 3, then 3 / √36 = 0.5  Divide your result from step 1 by your result from step 2 (i.e. step 1/step 2)  Step 4:  Look up the z-score you calculated in step 3 in the z-table . If you don’t remember how to look up z-scores,  you can find an explanation in step 1 of this article: Area to the right of a z-score . Step 5:  Subtract your z-score from 0.5. Step 6:  Convert the decimal in Step 5 to a percentage . In our example, 0.3446 = 34.46%. That’s it! 2. Specific Example Q. A certain group of welfare recipients receives SNAP benefits of $110 per week with a standard deviation of $20. If a random sample of 25 people is taken, what is the probability their mean benefit will be greater than $120 per week? Step 1: Insert the information into the z-formula: = (120-110)/20 √25 = 10/ (20/5) = 10/4 = 2.5.  Step 2: Look up the z-score in a table (or calculate it using technology). A z-score of 2.5 has an area of roughly 49.38%. Adding 50% (for the left half of the curve), we get 99.38%. Back to top for more Central Limit Theorem Examples Central Limit Theorem Examples: Less than  Solving Central Limit Theorem word problems that contain the phrase “less than” (or a similar phrase such as “lower”). Watch the video or read the steps below:  1. General Steps  Step 1:  Identify the parts of the problem . Your question should state:  the mean (average or μ)  the standard deviation (σ)  population size  sample size (n)  a number associated with “less than” ( )  Step 2:  Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area roughly below (i.e. the “less than” area). This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for. Step 3:  Use the following formula to find the z-score. Plug in the numbers from step 1. Click here if you want simple, step-by-step instructions for using this formula . If formulas confuse you, all this formula is asking you to do is:  Subtract the mean (μ in step 1) from the less than’ value ( in step 1). Set this number aside for a moment.  Divide the standard deviation (σ in step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in step 1). For example, if thirty six children are in your sample and your standard deviation is 2, then 3 / √ 36 = 0.5  Divide your result from step 1 by your result from step 2 (i.e. step 1/step 2)  Step 4:  Look up the z-score you calculated in step 4 in the z-table . If you don’t remember how to look up z-scores you can find an explanation in step 1 of this article on area to the right of a z-score in a normal distribution curve . Step 5:  Add your z-score to 0.5. For example, if your z-score is 0.1554, then 0.5 + 0.1554 is 0.6554. Step 6: Convert the decimal in Step 6 to a percentage . In our example, 0.6554 = 65.54%. That’s it! 2. Specific Example A population of 29 year-old males has a mean salary of $29,321 with a standard deviation of $2,120. If a sample of 100 men is taken, what is the probability their mean salaries will be less than $29,000?  Step 1: Insert the values into the z-formula: = (29,000 – 29,321) / (2,120/√100) = -321/212 = -1.51.  Step 2: Look up the z-score in the left-hand z-table (or use technology). -1.51 has an area of 93.45%.  However, this is not the answer, as the question is asking for LESS THAN, and 93.45% is the area “greater than” so you need to subtract from 100%. 100% – 93.45% = 6.55% or about 0.07. Back to top for more Central Limit Theorem Examples Central Limit Theorem Examples: Between Watch the video for an example or read the steps below:  Sample problem: There are 250 dogs at a dog show who weigh an average of 12 pounds, with a standard deviation of 8 pounds. If 4 dogs are chosen at random, what is the probability they have an average weight of greater than 8 pounds and less than 25 pounds?  Step 1: Identify the parts of the problem. Your question should state:  mean (average or μ) standard deviation (σ) population size  sample size (n)  number associated with “less than” 1  number associated with “greater than” 2  Step 2: Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area between   1 and   2. This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for.    Step 3: Use the following formula to find the z-scores.   All this formula is asking you to do is: a)   Subtract the mean (μ in Step 1) from the greater than value (Xbar in Step 1): 25 – 12 = 13. b)  Divide the standard deviation (σ in Step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in Step 1): 8 / √ 4 = 4 c)   Divide your result from a by your result from b : 13 / 4 = 3.25 Step 4 Use the formula from Step 3 to find the z-values. This time, use Xbar2 from Step 1 (8). a)   Subtract the mean (μ in Step 1) from the greater than value (Xbar in Step 1): 8 – 12 = -4. b)  Divide the standard deviation (σ in Step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in Step 1): 8 / √ 4 = 4 c)   Divide your result from a by your result from b: -4 / 4= -1 Step 5: Look up the value you calculated in Step 3 in the z-table . Z value of 3.25 corresponds to .4994 Step 6: Look up the value you calculated in Step 4 in the z-table . Z value of 1 corresponds to .3413 Note that the bell curve is symmetrical, so if you want to look up a negative value like -1, then just look up the positive counterpart. The area will be the same. Step 7: Add Step 5 and 6 together: .4994 + .3413 = .8407 Step 8: Convert the decimal in Step 7 to a percentage: .8407 = 84.07% That’s it!

Step 2: Press F5 and scroll down to C: BinomialCdf . Step 3: Enter 45 in the Num Trials box. Step 4: Scroll down and enter .33 in the Prob Success box. Step 5: Scroll down and enter 9 in the Lower Value box (because 20% of 45 = 9). Step 6: Scroll down and enter 18 in the Upper Value box (because 40% of 45 = 18). Press ENTER. Step 7: Read the Result: Cdf = .857142 . This means that the probability your random sample will have 20 – 40% inner city students is 85.71% . TI 83 Central Limit Theorem: Overview Watch the video or read the article below:  The TI 83 calculator has a built in function that can help you calculate probabilities of central theorem word problems, which usually contain the phrase “assume the distribution is normal” (or a variation of that phrase). The function, normalcdf, requires you to enter a lower bound, upper bound, mean, and standard deviation . Sample problem : A fertilizer company manufactures organic fertilizer in 10 pound bags with a standard deviation of 1.25 pounds per bag. What is the probability that a random sample of 15 bags will have a mean between 9 and 9.5 pounds? Step 1 : 2nd VARS 2. Step 2 : Enter your variables (lower bound, upper bound, mean, and standard deviation). Separate each variable by a comma: 9,9.5, 10,(1.25/√15)). Step 3 : Press ENTER. This returns the probability of .05969, or .05969% . Tip: If you have a question that asks for “greater than” or “less than” a certain number, enter 999999999 for the lower or upper bound. For example, if you wanted to know the probability of greater than 8 pounds you would enter: NORMALCDF(8,999999999,10,1./√(15)) Less than 8 pounds you would enter: NORMALCDF(999999999,8,10,1./√(15)) Tip : Sampling distributions require that the standard deviation of the mean is σ / √(n), so make sure you enter that as the standard deviation.

Farm-raised trout contain an average of 32 grams of fat per pound, with a standard deviation of 7.5 grams of fat per pound. A random sample of 36 farm-raised trout is selected. The mean fat content for the sample is 30.7 grams per pound. Find the probability of observing a sample mean of 30.7 grams of fat per pound or less in a random sample of 36 farm-raised trout.

You convert X to Z scores using X-MEAN/(sd/sq.root N)  (30.7 - 32)/(7.5/6) = -1.04  P (Z < -1.04) - Look in the z-tables for this value to find corresponding probability value. Take this probability value and subtract from  0.5, and that is your answer.                    You must log in or register to reply here.

        population. Suppose further that we compute a statistic (e.g., a mean, proportion, standard deviation) for each 
        sample. The probability 
	    distribution of this statistic is called a sampling distribution . And
        the standard deviation of this statistic is called the standard error .  Variability of a Sampling Distribution  The variability of a sampling distribution is measured by its variance or its standard deviation .  The variability of a sampling
        distribution depends on three factors:   N: The number of observations in the population.  n: The number of observations in the sample.  The way that the random sample is chosen.   If the population size is much larger than the sample size, then the sampling 
        distribution has roughly the same standard error, whether we sample with or without replacement . On the other hand, if the sample represents a 
        significant fraction (say, 1/20) of the population size, the standard error 
        will be meaningfully smaller, when we sample without replacement.  Sampling Distribution of the Mean  Suppose we draw all possible samples of size n from a population of size N . 
        Suppose further that we compute a mean score for each sample. In this way, we 
        create a sampling distribution of the mean.  We know the following about the sampling distribution of the mean.  
        The mean of the sampling distribution (μ x ) 
        is equal to the mean of the population (μ). 
        And the standard error of the sampling distribution (σ x ) 
        is determined by the standard deviation of the population (σ), 
        the population size (N), and the sample size (n). These relationships are shown in the 
        equations below:  μ x = μ σ x = [ σ / sqrt(n) ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  In the standard error formula, the factor sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ] is called the finite population correction or fpc. 
        When the population size is very large relative to the sample size, the fpc is approximately
        equal to one; and the standard error formula can be approximated by:  σ x = σ / sqrt(n).  You often see this "approximate" formula in introductory statistics texts. As a general rule, it is 
            safe to use the approximate formula when the sample size is no bigger than 1/20 of the 
            population size.  Sampling Distribution of the Proportion  In a population of size N , suppose that the probability of the occurrence 
        of an event (dubbed a "success") is P; and the probability of the event's 
        non-occurrence (dubbed a "failure") is Q. From this population, suppose that we 
        draw all possible samples of size n . And finally, within each sample, 
        suppose that we determine the proportion of successes p and failures q . 
        In this way, we create a sampling distribution of the proportion.  We find that the mean of the sampling distribution of the proportion (μ p ) 
        is equal to the probability of success in the population (P). And the standard 
        error of the sampling distribution (σ p ) 
        is determined by the standard deviation of the population (σ), 
        the population size, and the sample size. These relationships are shown in the 
        equations below:  μ p = P  σ p = [ σ / sqrt(n) ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  where σ = sqrt[ PQ ].  Like the formula for the standard error of the mean, the formula for the standard error of the
        proportion uses the finite population correction, sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]. 
        When the population size is very large relative to the sample size, the fpc is approximately
        equal to one; and the standard error formula can be approximated by:  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ]  You often see this "approximate" formula in introductory statistics texts. As a general rule, it is 
            safe to use the approximate formula when the sample size is no bigger than 1/20 of the 
            population size.           Central Limit Theorem  The central limit theorem states that the 
        sampling distribution of the mean of any independent , random variable will be normal or nearly normal, 
        if the sample size is large enough.  How large is "large enough"? The answer depends on two factors.   Requirements for accuracy. The more 
            closely the sampling distribution needs to resemble a normal distribution, 
            the more sample points will be required.  The shape of the underlying population. The more closely the 
            original population resembles a normal distribution, the fewer sample points will
            be required.   In practice, some statisticians say that a sample size of 30 is large enough
        when the population distribution is roughly bell-shaped. Others recommend a sample 
        size of at least 40. But if the original population is distinctly not normal 
        (e.g., is badly skewed, has multiple peaks, and/or has outliers), researchers
        like the sample size to be even larger.   How to Choose Between T-Distribution and Normal Distribution   The t distribution and the normal distribution can both
        be used with statistics that have a bell-shaped distribution. This suggests that we might use either the t-distribution
        or the normal distribution to analyze sampling distributions. Which should we choose?  Guidelines exist to help you make that choice. Some focus on the population standard deviation.   If the population standard deviation is known, use the normal distribution  If the population standard deviation is unknown, use the t-distribution.   Other guidelines focus on sample size.   If the sample size is large, use the normal distribution. (See the 
            discussion above in the section on the Central Limit Theorem to understand what is meant
            by a "large" sample.)  If the sample size is small, use the t-distribution.   In practice, researchers employ a mix of the above guidelines. On this site, we use the normal
        distribution when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large.
        We might use either distribution when standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is very large. 
        We use the t-distribution when the sample size is small, unless the underlying 
        distribution is not normal. The t distribution should not be used with small samples from populations 
        that are not approximately normal.       Test Your Understanding  In this section, we offer two examples that illustrate how sampling distributions are used 
        to solve commom statistical problems. In each of these problems, the population standard deviation is 
        known; and the sample size is large. So you can use the Normal Distribution 
        Calculator, rather than the t-Distribution Calculator, to compute probabilities for these problems.   Normal Distribution Calculator  The normal calculator solves common statistical problems, based on the normal 
	    distribution. The calculator computes cumulative probabilities, based on three 
	    simple inputs. Simple instructions guide you to an accurate solution, quickly 
	    and easily. If anything is unclear, frequently-asked questions and sample 
	    problems provide straightforward explanations. The  
		calculator is free. It can found in the Stat Trek
        main menu under the Stat Tools tab. Or you can tap the button below.  Normal Distribution Calculator   Would it be wrong to use the t-distribution when you know the population standard deviation and the sample
        size is large? Not at all. When the sample size is large, the t-distribution and the normal distribution
        yield approximately the same results.  Example 1  Assume that a school district has 10,000 6th graders. In this district, the 
        average weight of a 6th grader is 80 pounds, with a standard deviation of 20 
        pounds. Suppose you draw a random sample of 50 students. What is the 
        probability that the average weight of a sampled student will be less than 75 
        pounds?  Solution: To solve this problem, we need to define the sampling 
        distribution of the mean. Because our sample size is greater than 
        30, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution will 
        approximate a normal distribution.  To define our normal distribution, we need to know both the mean of the sampling 
        distribution and the standard deviation. Finding the mean of the sampling 
        distribution is easy, since it is equal to the mean of the population. Thus, 
        the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to 80.  The standard deviation of the sampling distribution can be computed using the 
        following formula.  σ x = [ σ / sqrt(n) ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ] σ x = [ 20 / sqrt(50) ] * sqrt[ (10,000 - 50 ) / (10,000 - 1) ] σ x = (20/7.071) * (0.995) = 2.81  Let's review what we know and what we want to know. We know that the sampling 
    distribution of the mean is normally distributed with a mean of 80 and a 
    standard deviation of 2.81. We want to know the probability that a sample mean 
    is less than or equal to 75 pounds.  Because we know the population standard
    deviation and the sample size is large, we'll use the normal distribution to find
    probability. To solve the problem, we plug these inputs 
    into the Normal Probability Calculator: mean = 80, standard deviation = 2.81, 
    and normal random variable = 75. The Calculator tells us that the probability that the average 
    weight of a sampled student is less than 75 pounds is equal to 0.038.  Note: Since the population size is more than 20 times greater than the sample size,
        we could have used the "approximate" formula σ x = [ σ / sqrt(n) ]
        to compute the standard error. Had we done that, we would have found a standard error equal to 
        [ 20 / sqrt(50) ] or 2.83.  Example 2  Find the probability that of the next 120 births, no more than 40% will be 
        boys. Assume equal probabilities for the births of boys and girls.  Assume
        also that the number of births in the population (N) is very large, essentially
        infinite.  Solution: The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the proportion of boys 
        in 120 births will be approximately normally distributed.  The mean of the sampling distribution will be equal to the mean of the 
        population distribution. In the population, half of the births result in boys; 
        and half, in girls. Therefore, the probability of boy births in the population 
        is 0.50. Thus, the mean proportion in the sampling distribution should also be 
        0.50.  The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (i.e., the standard error) can be computed using the 
        following formula.  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ] * sqrt[ (N - n ) / (N - 1) ]  Here, the finite population correction is equal to 1.0, since the population
        size (N) was assumed to be infinite. Therefore, standard error formula reduces to:  σ p = sqrt[ PQ/n ] σ p = sqrt[ (0.5)(0.5)/120 ] = sqrt[0.25/120 ] = 0.04564  Let's review what we know and what we want to know. We know that the sampling 
        distribution of the proportion is normally distributed with a mean of 0.50 and 
        a standard deviation of 0.04564. We want to know the probability that no more 
        than 40% of the sampled births are boys.  Because we know the population standard
        deviation and the sample size is large, we'll use the normal distribution to find
        probability. To solve the problem, we plug these 
        inputs into the Normal Probability Calculator: mean = .5, standard deviation = 
        0.04564, and the normal random variable = .4. The Calculator tells us that the probability that no 
        more than 40% of the sampled births are boys is equal to 0.014.  Note: This problem can also be treated as a binomial experiment . Elsewhere, we showed how to analyze a binomial experiment . The binomial experiment
        is actually the more exact analysis. It produces a probability 
        of 0.018 (versus a probability of 0.14 that we found using the normal distribution).  Without a computer, 
        the binomial approach is computationally demanding. Therefore,
        many statistics texts emphasize the approach presented above,
        which uses the normal distribution to approximate the binomial.               Bestsellers Handheld Calculators Updated daily 1.

How to Find the Sample Mean  Variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean  Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean     Sample Mean Symbol The sample mean symbol is x̄, pronounced “x bar”. What is the Sample Mean? The sample mean is an average value found in a sample.  A sample is just a small part of a whole. For example, if you work for polling company and want to know how much people pay for food a year, you aren’t going to want to poll over 300 million people. Instead, you take a fraction of that 300 million (perhaps a thousand people); that fraction is called a sample.  The mean is another word for “average.” So in this example, the sample mean would be the average amount those thousand people pay for food a year. The sample mean is useful because it allows you to estimate what the whole population is doing, without surveying everyone. Let’s say your sample mean for the food example was $2400 per year. The odds are, you would get a very similar figure if you surveyed all 300 million people. So the sample mean is a way of saving a lot of time and money. Sample Mean Formula The sample mean formula is: x̄ = ( Σ x i ) / n If that looks complicated, it’s simpler than you think. Remember the formula to find an “average” in basic math? It’s the exact same thing, only the notation (i.e. the symbols) are just different. Let’s break it down into parts:  x̄ just stands for the “sample mean”  Σ means “add up”  x i “all of the x-values”  n means “the number of items in the sample”  Now it’s just a matter of plugging in numbers that you’re given and solving using arithmetic (there’s no algebra required–you can basically plug this in to any calculator).  Back to Top  How to Find the Sample Mean Watch the video or read the steps below:  How to Find the Sample Mean: Overview Dividing the sum by the number of items to find the mean. Finding the sample mean is no different from finding the average of a set of numbers. In statistics you’ll come across slightly different notation than you’re probably used to, but the math is exactly the same. The formula to find the sample mean is:  = ( Σ x i ) / n. All that formula is saying is add up all of the numbers in your data set ( Σ means “add up” and x i means “all the numbers in the data set). This article tells you how to find the sample mean by hand (this is also one of the AP Statistics formulas ). However, if you’re finding the sample mean, you’re probably going to be finding other descriptive statistics, like the sample variance or the interquartile range so you may want to consider finding the sample mean in Excel or other technology. Why? Although the calculation for the mean is fairly simple, if you use Excel then you only have to enter the numbers once. After that, you can use the numbers to find any statistic: not just the sample mean. How to Find the Sample Mean: Steps Sample Question: Find the sample mean for the following set of numbers: 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 40, 43, 55, 56, 67, 78, 78, 79, 80, 81, 90, 99, 101, 102, 304, 306, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405. Step 1: Add up all of the numbers : 12 + 13 + 14 + 16 + 17 + 40 + 43 + 55 + 56 + 67 + 78 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 90 + 99 + 101 + 102 + 304 + 306 + 400 + 401 + 403 + 404 + 405 = 3744 . Step 2: Count the numbers of items in your data set . In this particular data set there are 26 items. Step 3: Divide the number you found in Step 1 by the number you found in Step 2. 3744/26 = 144. That’s it! Tip: If you have to show working out on a test, just place the two numbers into the formula. Step 1 gives you the σ and Step 2 gives you n:  x = ( Σ x i ) / n = 3744/26 = 144 Back to Top  Variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean central limit theorem The Mean of the Sampling Distribution of the Mean Watch the video or read the article below: A sampling distribution where the mean = 6. Image: U of Oklahoma The sampling distribution of the sample mean is a probability distribution of all the sample means. Let’s say you had 1,000 people, and you sampled 5 people at a time and calculated their average height. If you kept on taking samples (i.e. you repeated the sampling a thousand times), eventually the mean of all of your sample means will:  Equal the population mean , μ  Look like a normal distribution curve.   Note : The proof of these facts is beyond any elementary statistics course, but you can see the proof here . The variance of this probability distribution gives you an idea of how spread out your data is around the mean . The larger the sample size, the more closely the sample mean will represent the population mean . In other words, as N grows larger, the variance becomes smaller. Ideally, when the sample mean matches the population mean, the variance will equal zero. The formula to find the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean is: σ 2 M = σ 2 / N, where: σ 2 M = variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. σ 2 = population variance . N = your sample size. Sample question: If a random sample of size 19 is drawn from a population distribution with standard deviation α = 20 then what will be the variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean? Step 1: Figure out the population variance . Variance is the standard deviation squared, so: σ 2 = 20 2 = 400. Step 2: Divide the variance by the number of items in the sample. This sample has 19 items, so: 400 / 19 = 21.05. That’s it! Back to Top Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean Watch the video or read the article below: How to Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean: Overview Standard error for the sample mean, “s.” The standard error of the mean of a sample is equal to the standard deviation for the sample . The difference between standard error and standard deviation is that with standard deviations you use population data (i.e. parameters ) and with standard errors you use data from your sample. You can calculate standard error for the sample mean using the formula: SE = s/√(n) SE = standard error, s = the standard deviation for your sample and n is the number of items in your sample. Calculate Standard Error for the Sample Mean: Steps Example: Find the standard error for the following heights (in cm): Jim (170.5), John (161), Jack (160), Freda (170), Tai (150.5). Step 1: Find the mean (the average ) of the data set: (170.5 + 161 + 160 + 170 + 150.5) / 5 = 162.4. Step 2: Calculate the deviation from the mean by subtracting each value from the mean you found in Step 1. 170.5 – 162.4 = -8.1 161 – 162.4 = 1.4 160 – 162.4 = 2.4 170 – 162.4 = -7.6 150.5 – 162.4 = 11.9 Step 3: Square the numbers you calculated in Step 2: -8.1 * -8.1 = 65.61 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 2.4 * 2.4 = 5.76 -7.6 * -7.6 = 57.76 11.9 * 11.9 = 141.61 Step 4: Add the values you calculated in Step 3: 65.61 + 1.96 + 5.76 + 57.76 + 141.61 = 272.7 Step 5: Divide the number you found in Step 4 by your sample size – 1 . There are five items in the sample, so n-1 = 4: 272.7 / 4 = 68.175. Step 6: Take the square root of the number you found in Step 5. This is your standard deviation. √(68.175) = 8.257 Step 6: Divide the number you calculated in Step 6 by the square root of the sample size (in this sample problem, the sample size is 5): 8.257 / √(5) = 8.257 / 2.236 = 3.693 That’s how to calculate the standard error for the sample mean! Tip: If you’re asked to find the “standard error” for a sample, in most cases you’re finding the sample error for the mean using the formula SE = s/&sqrt;n. There are different types of standard error though (i.e. for proportions), so you may want to make sure you’re calculating the right statistic.

        normal populations  describe the distribution of the sample mean for samples obtained from 
        a population that is not normal    For a quick overview of this section, feel free to watch this short video summary:   Sampling Distributions  Consider the following three news items.   The average price of unleaded regular fell by 1.6 cents to $3.667
          a gallon on Saturday, from $3.683 a gallon, according to survey
          results from the motorist group AAA. (Source: CNNMoney.com )  The Census Bureau on Tuesday released the 2007 American
          Community Survey, the government's annual estimates of
          social, economic and housing characteristics for the nation. Among the
          highlights: 25.3 - In minutes, the average commute to work in 2007 ,
          an increase from 25.0 minutes in 2006. (Source: Chicago
            Tribune )  Barack Obama leads John McCain, 49% to 44% , when registered
          voters are asked who they would vote for if the election were held today,
          according to the latest Gallup
            Poll Daily tracking update. (Source: Gallup )   All three of these are estimates based on samples In fact, they're probably not correct, due to sampling error. From Section 1.4 ,  Sampling error is the error that results from using a sample to estimate        information regarding a population.  The idea is this - unless we sample every single individual in the sample, there will be some error in our results. Our goal in this section will be to characterize the distribution of the sample mean.  The Distribution of the Sample Mean  Let's look again at the definition of a random variable , from Section 6.1 .  A random variable is a numerical measure of the outcome of a probability
        experiment whose value is determined by chance.  Think about the sample mean, . Isn't it's value determined by chance as well? Since we the individuals in a sample are randomly selected, the sample mean will depend on those individuals selected, so it, too, is a random variable. The big question, then, is the distribution of - in other words, what are its mean (the mean of the sample mean, ) and its standard deviation (the standard deviation of the sample mean, )?  To investigate these, let's look at a particular population.  Consider the heights of the players from the starting line-up from the 2008 Men's Olympic Basketball gold medal game - Jason Kidd (76"), LeBron James (80"), Kobe Bryant (78"), Carmelo Anthony (78"), and Dwight Howard (83"). (Source: NBC Sports ) The mean of the population is 79", with a standard deviation of 2.37"  First, let's consider the different samples of size 2. There are 10 such samples ( 5 C 2 = 10), shown below, along with their corresponding sample means.     sample  heights     Kidd, James  76, 80  78    Kidd, Bryant  76, 78  77    Kidd, Anthony  76, 78  77    Kidd, Howard  76, 83  79.5    James, Bryant  80, 78  79    James, Anthony  80, 78  79    James, Howard  80, 83  81.5    Bryant, Anthony  78, 78  78    Bryant, Howard  78, 83  80.5    Anthony, Howard  78, 83  80.5     Interestingly, the mean of the sample means of size 2 is 79" as well. This is actually reasonable, though, because we know that the mean of a random variable is also its expected value , and it makes perfect sense that the value we should expect from the sample mean is the same as the population mean!  The standard deviation, though, is very different. It helps to look at things visually. The image below represents all possible sample means for samples of size 1 (individuals), 2, 3, 4, and 5 (the population). Pay particular attention to the standard deviation.   The interesting things to note here are that = 79, regardless of the sample size, but the standard deviation decreases as n increases. If we think about this a bit, this too, is reasonable. The more individuals we have in our sample, the more likely we are to be closer to the true mean. Things brings us to our first major point.   The Law of Large Numbers  As n increases, the difference between and μ approaches zero.   We're now ready to investigate the standard deviation of a bit more in-depth.  The Central Limit Theorem   The Central Limit Theorem  Regardless of the distribution shape of the population, the sampling distribution of becomes approximately normal as the sample size n increases (conservatively n≥30).   This is very interesting! So it doesn't matter if the distribution shape was left-skewed, right-skewed, uniform, binomial, anything - the distribution of the sample mean will always become normal as the sample size increases. What an amazing result!  Exploring the Distribution of the Sample Mean  To do some exploring yourself, go to the Demonstrations Project from Wolfram Research, and download the Central Limit Theorem demonstration . If you haven't already, download and install the player by clicking on the image to the right.  Once you have the player installed and the Central Limit Theorem demonstration downloaded, move the slider for the sample size to get a sense of its affect on the distribution shape. You can also move the new sample slider to get a different sample.   The Distribution of the Sample Mean  We can even be more specific about the distribution of :   The Sampling Distribution of  If a simple random sample of size n is drawn from a large population with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the sampling distribution of will have mean and standard deviation:      and      where is the standard error of the mean .  Key fact: If the population is normally distributed, then the sample mean will be normally distributed, regardless of the sample size.   Now let's apply this distribution to various problems.  Using the Central Limit Theorem  In order to find probabilities about a normal random variable, we need to first know its mean and standard deviation. With the results of the Central Limit Theorem, we now know the distribution of the sample mean, so let's try using that in some examples.  Let's see a couple examples.   Example 1   Let's consider again the distribution of IQs that we looked at in Example 1 in Section 7.1.  We saw in that example that tests for an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) are designed to be normally distributed, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.  What is the probability that a randomly selected sample of 20 individuals would have a mean IQ of more than 105?  Solution:  To answer this question, we need to find P( > 105), if n = 20. Before we can do that, we need to first find the distribution of . From the distribution of the sample mean, we know and .  Here's what the distribution of looks like in relation to the distribution of X.   Now that we have the standard deviation, we can find the probability. Using StatCrunch...     Example 2   Source: stock.xchng  In Example 2 in Section 7.1, we were told that weights of 1-year-old boys are approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 22.8 lbs and a standard deviation of about 2.15. (Source: About.com )  Suppose the sample mean of the 10 1-year-old boys at the Kiddie Care day care center is 22.3 lbs. Is that unusual?  Solution:  In order to determine if an event is unusual , we need to find its probability. If the probability of the event is less than 5%, we can classify it as an unusual event.  In this case, we want to find the probability of observing a sample mean of 22.3 or less. Using the distribution of the sample mean, and . Using StatCrunch...   So we'd observe a sample mean of 22.3 lbs or less from a sample of 10 1-year-old boys about 23% of the time, which is not very unusual at all.    Here's one for you to try:   Example 3   Suppose that a particular professor's Statistics exam on probability traditionally has a mean score of 74, with a standard deviation of 11.  The professor suspects that his current crop of students is very strong. To compare, he gives them the same exam he has in the past. The sample mean of the 28 students in his current class was a 78.  Was the professor correct? Is his current class of students unusual compared to those from the past?  [ reveal answer ]   Like the previous example, we need to find the probability of our event in order to determine if it was unusual.  Using the distribution of the sample mean, we know that and . Using StatCrunch...   Since the probability of observing a class of 28 students with an average score of 78 is less than 0.05, it does look like this particular class is unusual.

Define the sample maximum:  $$ M = \max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) $$  Some simulations I've done (see the R code below) seem to indicate that the probability of observing a value as extreme, or more extreme, than the sample maximum is approximately $1/n$ (is this true?).  Specifically the simulations indicate that  $$ E \big(1 - F(M) \big) \approx \frac{1}{n} $$  The fact that, for example, the maximum from a sample of size 1000 should basically be a 1 in 1000 shot agrees with my intuition but I'm having trouble deriving this mathematically.  Any advice on this is appreciated.  set.seed(15435)

So you assume further that the rv's have a continuous distribution, therefore the maximum value is unique with probability 1.
So the problem is symmetric in the variables, i.e. for
each $1\leq k \leq n$ the probability that 
$$ P(X_k=\max(X_1,\ldots,X_n))=c $$
with $c$ constant. Since the probabilities sum up to unity, you get immediately $c=1/n$. Now this means further if you have $n$ values from $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ and you get a further value $X_{n+1}$ the probability that it is larger than all values before is $1/(n+1)$.  The field of probability theory concerned with such questions is called Extreme Value Theory .

Here’s what the Central Limit Theorem is saying, graphically. The picture below shows one of the simplest types of test: rolling a fair die . The more times you roll the die , the more likely the shape of the distribution of the means tends to look like a normal distribution graph . Photo credit:cmglee|Wikimedia Commons  The Central Limit Theorem and Means An essential component of the Central Limit Theorem is that the average of your sample means will be the population mean . In other words, add up the means from all of your samples, find the average and that average will be your actual population mean. Similarly, if you find the average of all of the standard deviations in your sample , you’ll find the actual standard deviation for your population. It’s a pretty useful phenomenon that can help accurately predict characteristics of a population . Watch a video explaining this phenomenon, or read more about it here: The Mean of the Sampling Distribution of the Mean . Central Limit Theorem Examples . A Central Limit Theorem word problem will most likely contain the phrase “assume the variable is normally distributed ”, or one like it. With these central limit theorem examples, you will be given:  A population (i.e. 29-year-old males, seniors between 72 and 76, all registered vehicles, all cat owners)  An average (i.e. 125 pounds, 24 hours, 15 years, $15.74)  A standard deviation (i.e. 14.4lbs, 3 hours, 120 months, $196.42)  A sample size (i.e. 15 males, 10 seniors, 79 cars, 100 households)  Click the link to skip down to one of three central limit theorem examples:  I want to find the probability that the mean is greater than a certain number  I want to find the probability that the mean is less than a certain number  I want to find the probability that the mean is between a certain set of numbers either side of the mean  Central Limit Theorem Examples: Greater than For Central Limit Theorem word problems that contain the phrase “greater than” (or a similar phrase such as “above”).   1. General Steps  Step 1: Identify the parts of the problem . Your question should state:  the mean (average or μ)  the standard deviation (σ)  population size  sample size (n)  a number associated with “greater than” ( ). Note : this is the sample mean . In other words, the problem is asking you “What is the probability that a sample mean of x items will be greater than this number?  Step 2:  Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area roughly above (i.e. the “greater than” area). This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for. Step 3:  Use the following formula to find the z-score . Plug in the numbers from step 1. Click here if you want easy, step-by-step instructions for solving this formula.  Subtract the mean (μ in step 1) from the ‘greater than’ value ( in step 1). Set this number aside for a moment. Divide the standard deviation (σ in step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in step 1). For example, if thirty six children are in your sample and your standard deviation is 3, then 3 / √36 = 0.5  Divide your result from step 1 by your result from step 2 (i.e. step 1/step 2)  Step 4:  Look up the z-score you calculated in step 3 in the z-table . If you don’t remember how to look up z-scores,  you can find an explanation in step 1 of this article: Area to the right of a z-score . Step 5:  Subtract your z-score from 0.5. Step 6:  Convert the decimal in Step 5 to a percentage . In our example, 0.3446 = 34.46%. That’s it! 2. Specific Example Q. A certain group of welfare recipients receives SNAP benefits of $110 per week with a standard deviation of $20. If a random sample of 25 people is taken, what is the probability their mean benefit will be greater than $120 per week? Step 1: Insert the information into the z-formula: = (120-110)/20 √25 = 10/ (20/5) = 10/4 = 2.5.  Step 2: Look up the z-score in a table (or calculate it using technology). A z-score of 2.5 has an area of roughly 49.38%. Adding 50% (for the left half of the curve), we get 99.38%. Back to top for more Central Limit Theorem Examples Central Limit Theorem Examples: Less than  Solving Central Limit Theorem word problems that contain the phrase “less than” (or a similar phrase such as “lower”). Watch the video or read the steps below:  1. General Steps  Step 1:  Identify the parts of the problem . Your question should state:  the mean (average or μ)  the standard deviation (σ)  population size  sample size (n)  a number associated with “less than” ( )  Step 2:  Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area roughly below (i.e. the “less than” area). This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for. Step 3:  Use the following formula to find the z-score. Plug in the numbers from step 1. Click here if you want simple, step-by-step instructions for using this formula . If formulas confuse you, all this formula is asking you to do is:  Subtract the mean (μ in step 1) from the less than’ value ( in step 1). Set this number aside for a moment.  Divide the standard deviation (σ in step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in step 1). For example, if thirty six children are in your sample and your standard deviation is 2, then 3 / √ 36 = 0.5  Divide your result from step 1 by your result from step 2 (i.e. step 1/step 2)  Step 4:  Look up the z-score you calculated in step 4 in the z-table . If you don’t remember how to look up z-scores you can find an explanation in step 1 of this article on area to the right of a z-score in a normal distribution curve . Step 5:  Add your z-score to 0.5. For example, if your z-score is 0.1554, then 0.5 + 0.1554 is 0.6554. Step 6: Convert the decimal in Step 6 to a percentage . In our example, 0.6554 = 65.54%. That’s it! 2. Specific Example A population of 29 year-old males has a mean salary of $29,321 with a standard deviation of $2,120. If a sample of 100 men is taken, what is the probability their mean salaries will be less than $29,000?  Step 1: Insert the values into the z-formula: = (29,000 – 29,321) / (2,120/√100) = -321/212 = -1.51.  Step 2: Look up the z-score in the left-hand z-table (or use technology). -1.51 has an area of 93.45%.  However, this is not the answer, as the question is asking for LESS THAN, and 93.45% is the area “greater than” so you need to subtract from 100%. 100% – 93.45% = 6.55% or about 0.07.

If 4 dogs are chosen at random, what is the probability they have an average weight of greater than 8 pounds and less than 25 pounds?  Step 1: Identify the parts of the problem. Your question should state:  mean (average or μ) standard deviation (σ) population size  sample size (n)  number associated with “less than” 1  number associated with “greater than” 2  Step 2: Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area between   1 and   2. This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for.    Step 3: Use the following formula to find the z-scores.   All this formula is asking you to do is: a)   Subtract the mean (μ in Step 1) from the greater than value (Xbar in Step 1): 25 – 12 = 13. b)  Divide the standard deviation (σ in Step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in Step 1): 8 / √ 4 = 4 c)   Divide your result from a by your result from b : 13 / 4 = 3.25 Step 4 Use the formula from Step 3 to find the z-values. This time, use Xbar2 from Step 1 (8). a)   Subtract the mean (μ in Step 1) from the greater than value (Xbar in Step 1): 8 – 12 = -4. b)  Divide the standard deviation (σ in Step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in Step 1): 8 / √ 4 = 4 c)   Divide your result from a by your result from b: -4 / 4= -1 Step 5: Look up the value you calculated in Step 3 in the z-table . Z value of 3.25 corresponds to .4994 Step 6: Look up the value you calculated in Step 4 in the z-table . Z value of 1 corresponds to .3413 Note that the bell curve is symmetrical, so if you want to look up a negative value like -1, then just look up the positive counterpart. The area will be the same. Step 7: Add Step 5 and 6 together: .4994 + .3413 = .8407 Step 8: Convert the decimal in Step 7 to a percentage: .8407 = 84.07% That’s it!

Highlight the Stats/List Editor by using the scroll keys. Press ENTER. If you don’t see the Stats/List editor you need to load the app. See instructions here . Step 2: Press F5 and scroll down to C: BinomialCdf . Step 3: Enter 45 in the Num Trials box. Step 4: Scroll down and enter .33 in the Prob Success box. Step 5: Scroll down and enter 9 in the Lower Value box (because 20% of 45 = 9). Step 6: Scroll down and enter 18 in the Upper Value box (because 40% of 45 = 18). Press ENTER. Step 7: Read the Result: Cdf = .857142 . This means that the probability your random sample will have 20 – 40% inner city students is 85.71% . TI 83 Central Limit Theorem: Overview Watch the video or read the article below:  The TI 83 calculator has a built in function that can help you calculate probabilities of central theorem word problems, which usually contain the phrase “assume the distribution is normal” (or a variation of that phrase). The function, normalcdf, requires you to enter a lower bound, upper bound, mean, and standard deviation . Sample problem : A fertilizer company manufactures organic fertilizer in 10 pound bags with a standard deviation of 1.25 pounds per bag. What is the probability that a random sample of 15 bags will have a mean between 9 and 9.5 pounds? Step 1 : 2nd VARS 2. Step 2 : Enter your variables (lower bound, upper bound, mean, and standard deviation). Separate each variable by a comma: 9,9.5, 10,(1.25/√15)). Step 3 : Press ENTER. This returns the probability of .05969, or .05969% . Tip: If you have a question that asks for “greater than” or “less than” a certain number, enter 999999999 for the lower or upper bound. For example, if you wanted to know the probability of greater than 8 pounds you would enter: NORMALCDF(8,999999999,10,1./√(15)) Less than 8 pounds you would enter: NORMALCDF(999999999,8,10,1./√(15)) Tip : Sampling distributions require that the standard deviation of the mean is σ / √(n), so make sure you enter that as the standard deviation.

Plug in the numbers from step 1. Click here if you want easy, step-by-step instructions for solving this formula.  Subtract the mean (μ in step 1) from the ‘greater than’ value ( in step 1). Set this number aside for a moment. Divide the standard deviation (σ in step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in step 1). For example, if thirty six children are in your sample and your standard deviation is 3, then 3 / √36 = 0.5  Divide your result from step 1 by your result from step 2 (i.e. step 1/step 2)  Step 4:  Look up the z-score you calculated in step 3 in the z-table . If you don’t remember how to look up z-scores,  you can find an explanation in step 1 of this article: Area to the right of a z-score . Step 5:  Subtract your z-score from 0.5. Step 6:  Convert the decimal in Step 5 to a percentage . In our example, 0.3446 = 34.46%. That’s it! 2. Specific Example Q. A certain group of welfare recipients receives SNAP benefits of $110 per week with a standard deviation of $20. If a random sample of 25 people is taken, what is the probability their mean benefit will be greater than $120 per week? Step 1: Insert the information into the z-formula: = (120-110)/20 √25 = 10/ (20/5) = 10/4 = 2.5.  Step 2: Look up the z-score in a table (or calculate it using technology). A z-score of 2.5 has an area of roughly 49.38%. Adding 50% (for the left half of the curve), we get 99.38%.

Watch the video or read the steps below:  1. General Steps  Step 1:  Identify the parts of the problem . Your question should state:  the mean (average or μ)  the standard deviation (σ)  population size  sample size (n)  a number associated with “less than” ( )  Step 2:  Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area roughly below (i.e. the “less than” area). This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for. Step 3:  Use the following formula to find the z-score. Plug in the numbers from step 1. Click here if you want simple, step-by-step instructions for using this formula . If formulas confuse you, all this formula is asking you to do is:  Subtract the mean (μ in step 1) from the less than’ value ( in step 1). Set this number aside for a moment.  Divide the standard deviation (σ in step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in step 1). For example, if thirty six children are in your sample and your standard deviation is 2, then 3 / √ 36 = 0.5  Divide your result from step 1 by your result from step 2 (i.e. step 1/step 2)  Step 4:  Look up the z-score you calculated in step 4 in the z-table . If you don’t remember how to look up z-scores you can find an explanation in step 1 of this article on area to the right of a z-score in a normal distribution curve . Step 5:  Add your z-score to 0.5. For example, if your z-score is 0.1554, then 0.5 + 0.1554 is 0.6554. Step 6: Convert the decimal in Step 6 to a percentage . In our example, 0.6554 = 65.54%. That’s it! 2. Specific Example A population of 29 year-old males has a mean salary of $29,321 with a standard deviation of $2,120. If a sample of 100 men is taken, what is the probability their mean salaries will be less than $29,000?  Step 1: Insert the values into the z-formula: = (29,000 – 29,321) / (2,120/√100) = -321/212 = -1.51.  Step 2: Look up the z-score in the left-hand z-table (or use technology). -1.51 has an area of 93.45%.  However, this is not the answer, as the question is asking for LESS THAN, and 93.45% is the area “greater than” so you need to subtract from 100%. 100% – 93.45% = 6.55% or about 0.07.

If 4 dogs are chosen at random, what is the probability they have an average weight of greater than 8 pounds and less than 25 pounds?  Step 1: Identify the parts of the problem. Your question should state:  mean (average or μ) standard deviation (σ) population size  sample size (n)  number associated with “less than” 1  number associated with “greater than” 2  Step 2: Draw a graph. Label the center with the mean . Shade the area between   1 and   2. This step is optional, but it may help you see what you are looking for.    Step 3: Use the following formula to find the z-scores.   All this formula is asking you to do is: a)   Subtract the mean (μ in Step 1) from the greater than value (Xbar in Step 1): 25 – 12 = 13. b)  Divide the standard deviation (σ in Step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in Step 1): 8 / √ 4 = 4 c)   Divide your result from a by your result from b : 13 / 4 = 3.25 Step 4 Use the formula from Step 3 to find the z-values. This time, use Xbar2 from Step 1 (8). a)   Subtract the mean (μ in Step 1) from the greater than value (Xbar in Step 1): 8 – 12 = -4. b)  Divide the standard deviation (σ in Step 1) by the square root of your sample (n in Step 1): 8 / √ 4 = 4 c)   Divide your result from a by your result from b: -4 / 4= -1 Step 5: Look up the value you calculated in Step 3 in the z-table . Z value of 3.25 corresponds to .4994 Step 6: Look up the value you calculated in Step 4 in the z-table . Z value of 1 corresponds to .3413 Note that the bell curve is symmetrical, so if you want to look up a negative value like -1, then just look up the positive counterpart. The area will be the same. Step 7: Add Step 5 and 6 together: .4994 + .3413 = .8407 Step 8: Convert the decimal in Step 7 to a percentage: .8407 = 84.07% That’s it!

What is the probability that a random sample of 45 students from the population will have from 20% to 40% inner city students? Step 1: Press APPS. Highlight the Stats/List Editor by using the scroll keys. Press ENTER. If you don’t see the Stats/List editor you need to load the app. See instructions here . Step 2: Press F5 and scroll down to C: BinomialCdf . Step 3: Enter 45 in the Num Trials box. Step 4: Scroll down and enter .33 in the Prob Success box. Step 5: Scroll down and enter 9 in the Lower Value box (because 20% of 45 = 9). Step 6: Scroll down and enter 18 in the Upper Value box (because 40% of 45 = 18). Press ENTER. Step 7: Read the Result: Cdf = .857142 . This means that the probability your random sample will have 20 – 40% inner city students is 85.71% . TI 83 Central Limit Theorem: Overview Watch the video or read the article below:  The TI 83 calculator has a built in function that can help you calculate probabilities of central theorem word problems, which usually contain the phrase “assume the distribution is normal” (or a variation of that phrase). The function, normalcdf, requires you to enter a lower bound, upper bound, mean, and standard deviation . Sample problem : A fertilizer company manufactures organic fertilizer in 10 pound bags with a standard deviation of 1.25 pounds per bag. What is the probability that a random sample of 15 bags will have a mean between 9 and 9.5 pounds? Step 1 : 2nd VARS 2. Step 2 : Enter your variables (lower bound, upper bound, mean, and standard deviation). Separate each variable by a comma: 9,9.5, 10,(1.25/√15)). Step 3 : Press ENTER. This returns the probability of .05969, or .05969% . Tip: If you have a question that asks for “greater than” or “less than” a certain number, enter 999999999 for the lower or upper bound. For example, if you wanted to know the probability of greater than 8 pounds you would enter: NORMALCDF(8,999999999,10,1./√(15)) Less than 8 pounds you would enter: NORMALCDF(999999999,8,10,1./√(15)) Tip : Sampling distributions require that the standard deviation of the mean is σ / √(n), so make sure you enter that as the standard deviation.

You convert X to Z scores using X-MEAN/(sd/sq.root N)  (30.7 - 32)/(7.5/6) = -1.04  P (Z < -1.04) - Look in the z-tables for this value to find corresponding probability value. Take this probability value and subtract from  0.5, and that is your answer.                    You must log in or register to reply here.
