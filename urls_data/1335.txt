  Babies second time around    Babies second time around   By Hannah Dahlen             “When are you going to have ‘number two’? You’re not going to let her be an only child? Don’t you think she needs a brother or sister?” Not only are we eventually asked these questions publicly by well meaning friends and relatives, but also at some point we begin to ask these same questions of ourselves privately as parents.  The decision to have more than one child is not an easy one for many parents. Australia’s fertility rate has declined dramatically over the last forty years and is now down to 1.7 children per family. Whilst having the first child fulfils those natural urges most of us have to be parents, having a second child for many parents seems to complete the family and most importantly provides a sibling for the first child. The decision to have a second child is not easy for everyone, neither is it always a conscious one. An unplanned second pregnancy can cause great turmoil, particularly if your first child is still a baby. You may still be trapped in that daze of sleepless nights and endless nappies and find it hard to comprehend that it will all start again in a few short months. Even when the second child is carefully planned, anxieties will surface and questions will need to be answered. Second time around as a parent you are suspended somewhere between a novice and an expert, and a dreamer and a realist.  Pregnancy second time around  Whist pregnancy the second time around is certainly familiar, it is rarely an identical experience to the first. Women often comment on how different each pregnancy is. Your body will also be slightly different second time around. The muscles of your abdomen are not as taught, you are likely to be a bit older and your life is most likely busier than it was when you were pregnant with the first baby.  Studies of differences in pregnancy symptoms between first time mothers and those having subsequent babies don’t show huge variations. Some symptoms, however, such as accidental leakage of urine with coughing or sneezing and dry skin are more likely to occur during a subsequent pregnancy. Stretch marks are reported less by women during a subsequent pregnancy than during their first. This is most likely due to the fact that all the stretching needed for subsequent pregnancies has already been done with the first baby. If, however, you have put on a lot of weight with the first baby and not lost it by the time you are pregnant again then the added weight gain can make you more prone to stretch marks.  If you had nausea and vomiting during your first pregnancy, you are more likely to have it in the next pregnancy, though the intensity may differ. The closer you have your babies together the more exaggerated the general aches and pains of pregnancy seem to be, such as a sore back and unstable feeling in your pelvis. Second time mothers are bending over picking up toys and lifting growing toddlers and this adds stress to vulnerable backs, joints and ligaments. You need to try and bend at the knees when you do these things rather than bending at the waist to reduce potential problems. If the aches and pains seem to be worst, in my experience mothers having second babies often tell me the pregnancy passes much quicker. We have less time to navel gaze when chasing a demanding child around the house.  Only you can decide when the best time is to get pregnant. Getting pregnant, however, in the first year following birth does put a big demand on your body. These women are more prone to getting anaemic and are more likely to need iron supplements during pregnancy. Discuss this with your care provider. You are likely to feel more tired during the second pregnancy, especially if your first child is still very young. You will have to try and snatch a nap when your child does.  Women having their second baby tend to feel the baby move earlier than women having their first baby. They are more likely to feel these movements at around 16 to 18 weeks compared to 18 to 22 weeks with their first. The most likely reason for this is they tend to recognise those first movements earlier. Women having their second baby are often surprised at how early they begin looking pregnant compared to their first experience. The maternity outfits do seem to be resorted to earlier. This is probably due to the fact that the abdominal muscles are not as toned as they were with the first and tend to allow the uterus to lean forwards a bit more. Unlike at the end of the first pregnancy women often find the baby’s head is less likely to go right down into their pelvis (engage). Sometimes this doesn’t happen until the labour actually begins.  If you had problems with your first pregnancy such as high blood pressure or premature labour you are at more risk of this occurring again and so will be watched closely for any potential problems. This doesn’t mean you will definitely have these problems again.  You may still be breastfeeding your first child and wondering what to do with another one on the way. It is a myth that breastfeeding while you are pregnant is harmful for either the breastfeeding child or the unborn baby. Concerns about harmful hormones in the milk or stimulating premature labour have not been supported by research. There is no reason why you cannot continue breastfeeding. Pregnancy is, however, the most likely time your child will wean or be easily weaned if this is your choice. Some children wean early in pregnancy because the breasts feel different, the quantity of milk decreases or the taste of the milk changes. Don’t be too insulted by an unexpected ‘yucky’ from your toddler. Later in pregnancy your expanding uterus may make feeding awkward and make your toddler lose interest. You may also find your breasts and nipples become very tender when you are pregnant.  Involving the first child in the pregnancy helps them to adjust to the concept of a new sibling easier. If you plan to have them present at the birth you need to start preparing them early. Make sure you have a support person organised for the child so they can be taken out of the situation if it distresses or bores them. The last thing you need when in labour is to be worrying about your child or have your partner unable to focus on you. If you plan not to have your child there for the birth remember to organise someone who will be on call during the last few weeks of the pregnancy.  Women having their second baby are less likely to attend parent education classes than they were with their first. Some hospitals run short, refresher, parent education courses for second time parents. You will best know what your needs are.  Birthing second time around  With the first baby you journey through a great unknown. You may have reasonable knowledge but you have no experience to draw on. With the second baby there is more of an understanding of what is going on. This does not mean you will have no anxieties. Sometimes the anxiety is in fact worse. With the first birth you can delude yourself but with the second you are forced to be a realist. If you had a hard time with the first baby you may in fact find you are more fearful than you were with your first. Many a second time mother has gripped my arm in labour and said “its all coming back to me now”. It is as if that protective amnesia that softens birth memories is rolled back with the first contraction. The reality is the second birth has a very high chance of being uncomplicated. Women often find the second birth helps to heal any disappointments they may have felt over the first birth experience.  The good news is second time around the labour is usually about half as long as the first and often it is even shorter than this (around 6 hours). If you had a normal vaginal birth with your first baby your chances of having this outcome again is around 96 percent. If you had a forceps delivery with your first birth you have over an 80 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth next time. Women who have a vacuum extraction (baby pulled out using a suction cup on the head) for the first birth have over a 91 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth with a following baby.  It is interesting to note that a recent study showed that while having a baby in posterior position (the back of the baby’s head lies against your spine) during the first labour and birth increases the incidence of forceps and caesarean section, it does not seem to have a major impact with the second baby. The baby seems to be able to turn easier and get itself into an anterior position (baby faces the mother’s spine).  Women who have a normal vaginal birth with their first child have a less than 2 percent chance of having a caesarean section with the second child. If you had a caesarean section for your first birth this does not mean you will need a caesarean with your second. Studies involving women who are allowed to try for a normal vaginal birth after a caesarean section indicate around 80 percent of these women go on to give birth vaginally and around 20 percent have another caesarean section. The risk of having a caesarean section, vacuum extraction or forceps delivery with the second child is lowest if the labour begins spontaneously and is highest if the labour is induced or augmented (sped up). This is great news for mothers embarking on a second pregnancy, particularly if they had to have assistance during the birth of their first baby. Women are often fearful that the second birth will be similar to the first birth.  If you had stitches in your perineum with the first baby, you are much less likely to need them, or need as many, second time around. This is despite the fact that second babies generally tend to be a little bit bigger than the first. Women having their second babies are also much less likely to need drugs for pain relief (pethidine, epidural) and cope much better with alternative methods of pain relief like showers, hot packs and massage. Giving birth second time around is pretty much all good news for most women.  Motherhood second time around  The ‘second child syndrome’ can be a remarkable relief and contrast to the first. Second babies often seem more settled and entertain or put themselves to sleep much easier than first babies do. This may be due to the fact that you are now a more seasoned mother and this confidence and common sense filters through to calm your child or it may be due to the fact that now there are two to care for you can’t focus as completely on the new baby as you could with the first. Perhaps we do practice our parenting skills on the first child and perfect them on subsequent children. You also tend to listen less to all the ‘experts’ second time around and listen more to yourself. The first time around you are determined to do it right! The second time around you realise this is an impossible task and you follow your instincts and draw on your own experience. There are of course plenty of exceptions to this rule and second time around you could get the more challenging child!  Breastfeeding is also generally not as difficult, particularly if you have successfully fed your first baby. If you did have problems with breastfeeding the first don't expect exactly the same problems with the second. Every baby is an individual. Don’t be surprised if the sight of you breastfeeding your new baby doesn’t rekindle memories and interest and even a little jealousy in your toddler. Some women continue to breastfeed their new baby and toddler at the same time. When this occurs toddlers can react with joy to the sudden flood of milk that comes in whilst others don’t appreciate the change. Breastfeeding can be a great way to make your toddler feel less threatened by the new baby and able to share your attention. On the other hand some women feel quite resentful over this huge demand on them. Remember whatever you do it must work for you!  Worrying how your first child will react to the new member of the family is a very natural process. The best way to minimise jealousy is to involve your first child in looking after the new baby. For some mothers there are feelings of guilt prior to the birth of a second child. They feel they are somehow being disloyal to their first-born and that the special relationship they have with them will be altered. Parents can also find it hard to imagine that they could possibly find room in their hearts to love another child as they do the first. The amazing thing about loving our children, however, is that love is so complete with each child, yet so limitless in it its capacity.

So bad, in fact that I've been put completely off s*x with my husband and hated him for months......hated him.  Wouldnt let him touch me - wanted him out the house and out my life - even though I do love him.  The mere thought of possibly going through all that again filled me with so much anxiety.  I love my little angel but any advances from poor hubby drove me insane.  Much more settled now -thank you       pruthvi   Feb 24, 2014  9:02am  [ 10 ]     Fantastic article.i'm pregnant for the second time and due in any moment now.

Amanda   Jan 2, 2015  11:20am  [ 13 ]     Sitting here, 9 weeks pregnant, with tears in my eyes. My little ones will be incredibly close in age (14 months) - not planned but certainly welcomed. Reading this article gave me peace & strength - thank you!       Melissa   Mar 4, 2015  8:42am  [ 14 ]     Very reassuring article, thank you! I have a nearly 2 and a half year old and am 37 weeks pregnant with my second. I had a difficult labor with my first- she was posterior and I had TERRIBLE back labor for going on three days. Finally I gave in and accepted pitocin and an epidural just a few hours before my daughter was born. It was a disappointing and traumatic experience, as I'd planned a natural birth and was so close to succeeding! I'm doing a home birth this time and while I am less nervous than with my first because I have a better idea about what to expect, this one is also posterior and attempts to turn him have been unsuccessful so far. I'll admit, the idea of days of back labor terrifies me. The fact that labor will likely be shorter is such a relief. I know I can handle it, but not for two days again!!       Nikol   Jun 13, 2015  2:18am  [ 15 ]     I am 7 weeks thusfar and already my pregnancy is dramatically different than my first (6 years ago). I was horribly sick everyday with my daughter and she was underweight due to not being able to eat since 3 weeks pregnant with her. This time, I do have quite a bit of back pain and cramping, however, I have had no sickness! I crave good food and have turned away from anything boxed foods. Bottom line, the second time around has been completely different!
As for the negative nasty comment about women worrying and asking questions...not everyone believes in going all the way to the doctors office to ask a question we feel may or may not be anything at all. We are pregnant. Our emotions and worries are on high at this time. I tell my daughter there's no such thing as a stupid question, unless it's a question you already know the answer to. All others are reasonable and natural. Have some compassion for heavens sake.
Good luck to all pregnant mommies!       Johanna   Mar 4, 2016  2:43pm  [ 16 ]     I agree, this is such a positive article and at the same time honest. Thank you so much for this combination and outlook!! Much appreciated from a mom about to give birth for the second time!!       Stella   Apr 28, 2016  12:30am  [ 17 ]     I literally had the urge to hug my computer screen after reading this, especially the Birthing section!  This was so reassuring, thank you so much!       Jonath   May 17, 2016  8:07pm  [ 18 ]     Thank you so much for answering so many questions i had on my mind.....i am @ 28wks with #2 & have 2 yr old boy....i happen to be blessed with a lot of breast milk & i plan to tandem feed them; though i am worried if i'll be able to love the second one as much as the first one....

Second labors are usually easier, faster and more suited to a birth plan than a first. This is, of course, a generalization but one that is pretty consistent. Second babies are easier to deliver than first babies. Why? Lots of reasons: Our uteruses get smarter and figure out how to do the job. All the muscles, tissues and bones have already stretched out making it easier for the baby to descend. The trail has already been blazed and is easier to travel than one you have to create from scratch. Moms of first babies are birth-virgins. They've never done it before. They don't know yet if their anatomy and their babies are compatible for a vaginal birth. Most of the time they are. She doesn't know yet how long it will take for her uterus to contract enough to dilate her cervix and push that kiddo out. There's a lot of literature that says the average first labor is 12 hours but if I've said it once...babies never read that literature. Some take longer than others. A lot longer. There's always some debate as to when labor actually starts. The official word is labor starts when strong, regular contractions cause cervical change. It's not always possible to determine that exact moment. Lots of moms have strong, regular contractions for hours (days, weeks by some stories) that don't cause significant change. Try telling them they're not in labor. Most moms will argue, "I don't care what you say, labor started at 3:00 this morning." I'm going with Mom's story. My first took 30 hours—no matter how the obstetrician timed it. I went with my birth plan for the first 25. Once I finally tried some stuff that was "off plan," labor progressed rapidly and my daughter was born 5 hours later. The point is, first labors take a long time. A lot of thought and planning for exactly how you want your labor to go is a good idea, but keep in mind that as the hours drag out and progress is slower than you hoped for, birth plans frequently have to change. Second labors, however, are perfect for birth plans. If you've already successfully delivered a baby vaginally, you most likely will again. Your labor will be shorter (usually) and it's way easier to deal with contractions when your cervix is dilating quickly and the finish line is in sight. Let me get specific here. One of the most common items on a birth plan is "no pain medication or epidural under any circumstances." OK, that's not so tough with a second labor that's likely to be over fairly quickly (anywhere from 1-12 hours). That's a tougher target to hit when you've been contracting forever, have run out of coping mechanisms and are still only 3 centimeters dilated. Another popular item: "No pitocin to augment labor under any circumstances." With a second labor, there's frequently no need. They're way more efficient and don't tend to need much encouragement to keep the ball rolling. Item: Want to labor in the tub? Perfect! This works beautifully with firsts too but second labors are so much smoother that frequently, a little time in the tub is all the pain management needed before complete dilation. Heck, I've had seconds go so fast in the tub the water didn't have time to cool down. Item: Want to wait until you feel the urge before you push? No problem. If you've followed your birth plan request for no pain management, you probably don't have an epidural. Believe me, once you have that urge to push, no one's going to stop you. You won't have to wait for it either. Once the baby is on her way through the birth canal, your urge to push will be so strong, it's irresistable. Remember those two long hours of pushing with the first? Thing of the past. Seconds pop right out. I've delivered seconds myself whey they came so quickly, they shot out like cannon balls. I was grateful there was a wall behind me for support. Doctor? Midwife? No time. Just snap on the gloves and catch. That hardly ever happens with a first. Some birth planning with the first is an important part of preparing for labor along with prenatal classes and a healthy dose of reading. Just please, remember that you're a birth-virgin and plan for flexibility. We're going to do everything in our power to help you achieve the birth of your dreams. We're all for birth plans but those of us who've been doing this for a while are more realistic than some first time parents. We know that plans sometimes have to change. It's an important first step in parenting. You'll raise the child you deliver, not the one you planned on. They might, or might not, be the same child. Most of the time, the child you birth is far and away better than anyone you've ever dreamed of. Best laid plans... Got a question for Jeanne?

  Babies second time around    Babies second time around   By Hannah Dahlen             “When are you going to have ‘number two’? You’re not going to let her be an only child? Don’t you think she needs a brother or sister?” Not only are we eventually asked these questions publicly by well meaning friends and relatives, but also at some point we begin to ask these same questions of ourselves privately as parents.  The decision to have more than one child is not an easy one for many parents. Australia’s fertility rate has declined dramatically over the last forty years and is now down to 1.7 children per family. Whilst having the first child fulfils those natural urges most of us have to be parents, having a second child for many parents seems to complete the family and most importantly provides a sibling for the first child. The decision to have a second child is not easy for everyone, neither is it always a conscious one. An unplanned second pregnancy can cause great turmoil, particularly if your first child is still a baby. You may still be trapped in that daze of sleepless nights and endless nappies and find it hard to comprehend that it will all start again in a few short months. Even when the second child is carefully planned, anxieties will surface and questions will need to be answered. Second time around as a parent you are suspended somewhere between a novice and an expert, and a dreamer and a realist.  Pregnancy second time around  Whist pregnancy the second time around is certainly familiar, it is rarely an identical experience to the first. Women often comment on how different each pregnancy is. Your body will also be slightly different second time around. The muscles of your abdomen are not as taught, you are likely to be a bit older and your life is most likely busier than it was when you were pregnant with the first baby.  Studies of differences in pregnancy symptoms between first time mothers and those having subsequent babies don’t show huge variations. Some symptoms, however, such as accidental leakage of urine with coughing or sneezing and dry skin are more likely to occur during a subsequent pregnancy. Stretch marks are reported less by women during a subsequent pregnancy than during their first. This is most likely due to the fact that all the stretching needed for subsequent pregnancies has already been done with the first baby. If, however, you have put on a lot of weight with the first baby and not lost it by the time you are pregnant again then the added weight gain can make you more prone to stretch marks.  If you had nausea and vomiting during your first pregnancy, you are more likely to have it in the next pregnancy, though the intensity may differ. The closer you have your babies together the more exaggerated the general aches and pains of pregnancy seem to be, such as a sore back and unstable feeling in your pelvis. Second time mothers are bending over picking up toys and lifting growing toddlers and this adds stress to vulnerable backs, joints and ligaments. You need to try and bend at the knees when you do these things rather than bending at the waist to reduce potential problems. If the aches and pains seem to be worst, in my experience mothers having second babies often tell me the pregnancy passes much quicker. We have less time to navel gaze when chasing a demanding child around the house.  Only you can decide when the best time is to get pregnant. Getting pregnant, however, in the first year following birth does put a big demand on your body. These women are more prone to getting anaemic and are more likely to need iron supplements during pregnancy. Discuss this with your care provider. You are likely to feel more tired during the second pregnancy, especially if your first child is still very young. You will have to try and snatch a nap when your child does.  Women having their second baby tend to feel the baby move earlier than women having their first baby. They are more likely to feel these movements at around 16 to 18 weeks compared to 18 to 22 weeks with their first. The most likely reason for this is they tend to recognise those first movements earlier. Women having their second baby are often surprised at how early they begin looking pregnant compared to their first experience. The maternity outfits do seem to be resorted to earlier. This is probably due to the fact that the abdominal muscles are not as toned as they were with the first and tend to allow the uterus to lean forwards a bit more. Unlike at the end of the first pregnancy women often find the baby’s head is less likely to go right down into their pelvis (engage). Sometimes this doesn’t happen until the labour actually begins.  If you had problems with your first pregnancy such as high blood pressure or premature labour you are at more risk of this occurring again and so will be watched closely for any potential problems. This doesn’t mean you will definitely have these problems again.  You may still be breastfeeding your first child and wondering what to do with another one on the way. It is a myth that breastfeeding while you are pregnant is harmful for either the breastfeeding child or the unborn baby. Concerns about harmful hormones in the milk or stimulating premature labour have not been supported by research. There is no reason why you cannot continue breastfeeding. Pregnancy is, however, the most likely time your child will wean or be easily weaned if this is your choice. Some children wean early in pregnancy because the breasts feel different, the quantity of milk decreases or the taste of the milk changes. Don’t be too insulted by an unexpected ‘yucky’ from your toddler. Later in pregnancy your expanding uterus may make feeding awkward and make your toddler lose interest. You may also find your breasts and nipples become very tender when you are pregnant.  Involving the first child in the pregnancy helps them to adjust to the concept of a new sibling easier. If you plan to have them present at the birth you need to start preparing them early. Make sure you have a support person organised for the child so they can be taken out of the situation if it distresses or bores them. The last thing you need when in labour is to be worrying about your child or have your partner unable to focus on you. If you plan not to have your child there for the birth remember to organise someone who will be on call during the last few weeks of the pregnancy.  Women having their second baby are less likely to attend parent education classes than they were with their first. Some hospitals run short, refresher, parent education courses for second time parents. You will best know what your needs are.  Birthing second time around  With the first baby you journey through a great unknown. You may have reasonable knowledge but you have no experience to draw on. With the second baby there is more of an understanding of what is going on. This does not mean you will have no anxieties. Sometimes the anxiety is in fact worse. With the first birth you can delude yourself but with the second you are forced to be a realist. If you had a hard time with the first baby you may in fact find you are more fearful than you were with your first. Many a second time mother has gripped my arm in labour and said “its all coming back to me now”. It is as if that protective amnesia that softens birth memories is rolled back with the first contraction. The reality is the second birth has a very high chance of being uncomplicated. Women often find the second birth helps to heal any disappointments they may have felt over the first birth experience.  The good news is second time around the labour is usually about half as long as the first and often it is even shorter than this (around 6 hours). If you had a normal vaginal birth with your first baby your chances of having this outcome again is around 96 percent. If you had a forceps delivery with your first birth you have over an 80 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth next time. Women who have a vacuum extraction (baby pulled out using a suction cup on the head) for the first birth have over a 91 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth with a following baby.  It is interesting to note that a recent study showed that while having a baby in posterior position (the back of the baby’s head lies against your spine) during the first labour and birth increases the incidence of forceps and caesarean section, it does not seem to have a major impact with the second baby. The baby seems to be able to turn easier and get itself into an anterior position (baby faces the mother’s spine).  Women who have a normal vaginal birth with their first child have a less than 2 percent chance of having a caesarean section with the second child. If you had a caesarean section for your first birth this does not mean you will need a caesarean with your second. Studies involving women who are allowed to try for a normal vaginal birth after a caesarean section indicate around 80 percent of these women go on to give birth vaginally and around 20 percent have another caesarean section. The risk of having a caesarean section, vacuum extraction or forceps delivery with the second child is lowest if the labour begins spontaneously and is highest if the labour is induced or augmented (sped up). This is great news for mothers embarking on a second pregnancy, particularly if they had to have assistance during the birth of their first baby. Women are often fearful that the second birth will be similar to the first birth.  If you had stitches in your perineum with the first baby, you are much less likely to need them, or need as many, second time around. This is despite the fact that second babies generally tend to be a little bit bigger than the first. Women having their second babies are also much less likely to need drugs for pain relief (pethidine, epidural) and cope much better with alternative methods of pain relief like showers, hot packs and massage. Giving birth second time around is pretty much all good news for most women.  Motherhood second time around  The ‘second child syndrome’ can be a remarkable relief and contrast to the first. Second babies often seem more settled and entertain or put themselves to sleep much easier than first babies do. This may be due to the fact that you are now a more seasoned mother and this confidence and common sense filters through to calm your child or it may be due to the fact that now there are two to care for you can’t focus as completely on the new baby as you could with the first. Perhaps we do practice our parenting skills on the first child and perfect them on subsequent children. You also tend to listen less to all the ‘experts’ second time around and listen more to yourself. The first time around you are determined to do it right! The second time around you realise this is an impossible task and you follow your instincts and draw on your own experience. There are of course plenty of exceptions to this rule and second time around you could get the more challenging child!  Breastfeeding is also generally not as difficult, particularly if you have successfully fed your first baby. If you did have problems with breastfeeding the first don't expect exactly the same problems with the second. Every baby is an individual. Don’t be surprised if the sight of you breastfeeding your new baby doesn’t rekindle memories and interest and even a little jealousy in your toddler. Some women continue to breastfeed their new baby and toddler at the same time. When this occurs toddlers can react with joy to the sudden flood of milk that comes in whilst others don’t appreciate the change. Breastfeeding can be a great way to make your toddler feel less threatened by the new baby and able to share your attention. On the other hand some women feel quite resentful over this huge demand on them. Remember whatever you do it must work for you!  Worrying how your first child will react to the new member of the family is a very natural process. The best way to minimise jealousy is to involve your first child in looking after the new baby. For some mothers there are feelings of guilt prior to the birth of a second child. They feel they are somehow being disloyal to their first-born and that the special relationship they have with them will be altered. Parents can also find it hard to imagine that they could possibly find room in their hearts to love another child as they do the first. The amazing thing about loving our children, however, is that love is so complete with each child, yet so limitless in it its capacity.

So bad, in fact that I've been put completely off s*x with my husband and hated him for months......hated him.  Wouldnt let him touch me - wanted him out the house and out my life - even though I do love him.  The mere thought of possibly going through all that again filled me with so much anxiety.  I love my little angel but any advances from poor hubby drove me insane.  Much more settled now -thank you       pruthvi   Feb 24, 2014  9:02am  [ 10 ]     Fantastic article.i'm pregnant for the second time and due in any moment now.

Maria   Dec 1, 2014  1:06pm  [ 12 ]     why do people use these sites and comment boards to ask for help or cry please help me. Go see a Doctor and ask questions for yourself. Good grief.       Amanda   Jan 2, 2015  11:20am  [ 13 ]     Sitting here, 9 weeks pregnant, with tears in my eyes. My little ones will be incredibly close in age (14 months) - not planned but certainly welcomed. Reading this article gave me peace & strength - thank you!       Melissa   Mar 4, 2015  8:42am  [ 14 ]     Very reassuring article, thank you! I have a nearly 2 and a half year old and am 37 weeks pregnant with my second. I had a difficult labor with my first- she was posterior and I had TERRIBLE back labor for going on three days. Finally I gave in and accepted pitocin and an epidural just a few hours before my daughter was born. It was a disappointing and traumatic experience, as I'd planned a natural birth and was so close to succeeding! I'm doing a home birth this time and while I am less nervous than with my first because I have a better idea about what to expect, this one is also posterior and attempts to turn him have been unsuccessful so far. I'll admit, the idea of days of back labor terrifies me. The fact that labor will likely be shorter is such a relief. I know I can handle it, but not for two days again!!       Nikol   Jun 13, 2015  2:18am  [ 15 ]     I am 7 weeks thusfar and already my pregnancy is dramatically different than my first (6 years ago). I was horribly sick everyday with my daughter and she was underweight due to not being able to eat since 3 weeks pregnant with her. This time, I do have quite a bit of back pain and cramping, however, I have had no sickness! I crave good food and have turned away from anything boxed foods. Bottom line, the second time around has been completely different!
As for the negative nasty comment about women worrying and asking questions...not everyone believes in going all the way to the doctors office to ask a question we feel may or may not be anything at all. We are pregnant. Our emotions and worries are on high at this time. I tell my daughter there's no such thing as a stupid question, unless it's a question you already know the answer to. All others are reasonable and natural. Have some compassion for heavens sake.
Good luck to all pregnant mommies!       Johanna   Mar 4, 2016  2:43pm  [ 16 ]     I agree, this is such a positive article and at the same time honest. Thank you so much for this combination and outlook!! Much appreciated from a mom about to give birth for the second time!!       Stella   Apr 28, 2016  12:30am  [ 17 ]     I literally had the urge to hug my computer screen after reading this, especially the Birthing section!  This was so reassuring, thank you so much!       Jonath   May 17, 2016  8:07pm  [ 18 ]     Thank you so much for answering so many questions i had on my mind.....i am @ 28wks with #2 & have 2 yr old boy....i happen to be blessed with a lot of breast milk & i plan to tandem feed them; though i am worried if i'll be able to love the second one as much as the first one....

By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | July 15, 2013 04:42pm ET                            MORE           A newborn baby  Credit: Newborn baby via Shutterstock     The world is eagerly awaiting the birth of the royal baby, but considering this is Kate Middleton's first pregnancy, is the baby likely to be late?  Buckingham Palace has not provided an official due date for the baby but has said the newborn is expected in mid-July.  Babies don't always arrive when they're supposed to, and mothers often say firstborns tend to be late, although this conclusion is typically based on anecdotal reports. [See 11 Big Fat Pregnancy Myths ].  Recently, Allen Downey, a professor of computer science at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass., did an analysis to find out if there was any truth to this old wives' tale. Downey studied a 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of 7,643 women, who reported 9,148 live births.  He found that first babies were, indeed, slightly more likely to be born late , at 41 weeks or later, compared with other babies (second-borns, third-borns, etc.)  The results showed that a firstborn baby has a 15 to 16 percent chance of being born late, compared with a 9 or 10 percent chance for other babies. Most babies were born at 39 weeks of pregnancy.  However, the study also found that firstborns were also more likely to be born early, at 37 weeks or earlier.  So, in general, firstborns were less likely to be born on time, said Downey, who is the author of " Think Stats " (O'Reilly Media, 2011). It's possible that first babies may be less likely to be on time because the date of conception is not accurate, Downey said.  Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of ambulatory care, obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., noted that a baby's due date is an estimate, and it's normal for babies to arrive two weeks before or after that day. Therefore, although parents may perceive a baby to be "late" if it arrives two weeks after the due date, this is not really the case.  "When you're expecting a first baby...you're locked on to the due date, and you expect the baby on that due date," Rabin said. But even if a woman thinks she knows exactly when she conceived, "it still can be two weeks high or low, and it's considered normal," she added.  Rabin said there is no known biological reason why firstborn babies would be more likely to be early or late.  After 42 weeks of pregnancy, a baby is considered overdue, Rabin said, and doctors become concerned about complications, such as an aging placenta that is not able to deliver proper nutrition to the baby.   According to the Mayo Clinic , a woman may be more likely to have an overdue baby if the baby is male. Will the royal heir be a boy?   Follow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner .

Scared about going into labour? You're not alone.    As your pregnancy nears its end, you’ll probably be thinking about what happened during your first labour and birth. It’s only natural to make comparisons and wonder if it will be the same this time around.  If you had a good experience, you're likely to be feeling relaxed about what's to come. But if you had a bad experience, or if you've had a long gap between your pregnancies, you may be feeling nervous. Find out what to expect this time around. Will my labour be different this time? You may find that your baby’s head engages in your pelvis later than it did in your first pregnancy. In fact, it may not engage until you go into labour (Viccars 2009) , when the contractions start to push your baby down into your pelvis.  Your contractions may become stronger more quickly than the first time around, and open up your cervix faster. Unless you had a caesarean, it will probably be easier for your baby's head to pass through the birth canal. This is because your pelvic floor muscles and the elastic walls of your vagina have been stretched before.  Your labour is also likely to be much shorter this time around. For first-time mums, the active first stage of labour (where the cervix dilates from 4cm to 10cm), lasts an average of eight hours, and is unlikely to last longer than 18 hours. For women who've had a baby before, the average is five hours, and it's unlikely to last longer than 12 hours (NCCWCH 2014) . Your pushing stage is likely to last under two hours, compared with three hours for first-time mums (NCCWCH 2014) .  My last labour was difficult. Will it be easier this time? Every labour is different. Many mums who have had a negative birth experience go on to have a positive one. Plus, this time around you know what to expect, so you're more able to prepare yourself for the birth. This in itself may reassure you.  If you're worried, you may find that writing a detailed birth plan helps you feel more in control. Although a birth plan can't cover all possible eventualities, it lets you lay out your hopes for the birth. This way your doctor or midwife and your birth partner know exactly what you want to happen. Your midwife will be happy to help you work out your preferences.  It’s important to talk through any concerns you have about labour. Your midwife , obstetrician or antenatal teacher will be able to give you plenty of advice and support.  Going through your birth notes with your midwife or doctor may also help you to understand what happened last time. You can request a copy of your labour notes by writing to the medical records department of your local hospital.  Many maternity departments offer a debriefing or listening service for women who have had a difficult birth . This can provide important reassurance and give you an extra chance to talk through any worries you may have. Contact your local unit to see what's available where you live. Can I choose where to have my next baby? As long as you're healthy, your pregnancy's going well, and your first labour was straightforward, you should be able to choose where to give birth .  If you're considering a home birth, this may be a better option for you than it was last time. Experts generally recommend that first-time mums give birth in a birth centre or hospital, as these are safest for the baby. But if you've given birth before, it's just as safe to have your baby at home (NCCWCH 2014) .  You're also less likely to have any kind of medical intervention at home compared with hospital. The same is true of giving birth at a birth centre or midwife-led unit (NCCWCH 2014) .  However, if you have a medical condition or had a complicated birth the first time around, a hospital birth is probably safest for you and your baby (NCCWCH 2007) . If you're hoping for a natural birth, try to select a hospital with low intervention rates, if possible. You should be able to find the information online, or you can ask your midwife for help.

If you had a caesarean section with your first baby, but are keen to have a vaginal birth this time, the odds are in your favour (RCOG 2007) . This is especially true if the reason you had a caesarean was specific to your last pregnancy. For example if your baby was breech or you had pre-eclampsia .  As long as your pregnancy is going well this time, your obstetrician is likely to support you in planning for a vaginal birth after caesarean ( VBAC ). About three out of four women who try for a VBAC go on to have a vaginal birth (RCOG 2007) . What if my baby arrived early last time? If you’ve had a baby prematurely before, this doesn't necessarily mean your next baby will be early too. However, it is more likely. There is about a one in five chance that you'll have another premature birth (Esplin et al 2008) . Every birth is different though, and there's still a four out of five chance that your baby will be full-term.  The odds change a little according to your circumstances. You may be slightly more likely to give birth prematurely this time if:   your last birth was very early, between 20 weeks and 31 weeks you've given birth prematurely twice before (Dodd et al 2013) If your labour does start prematurely this time, you'll probably recognise the signs straight away. Getting to hospital as soon as possible is the best thing for you and your baby. Will I have a bigger baby? There's evidence that second babies tend to be bigger than first babies (Swamy et al 2010) . But this isn't always the case.  If you've previously given birth to a large baby weighing 4.5kg (10lb) or more, you’re more likely to have a large baby this time (Heiskanen et al 2006, Walsh et al 2007) . But second babies are, on average, only 138g (5oz) heavier, which is about the same weight as a deck of playing cards (Wilcox et al 1996) .  To get an idea of your baby’s size and weight, your midwife will measure your bump with a tape measure during your antenatal appointments . If she has any concerns, she may book you in for an ultrasound scan to find out more. How can I prevent an episiotomy or tear? If you had a tear or an episiotomy with your first baby, try to use upright positions for pushing in the second stage of labour.  Using upright positions means gravity will help your baby to be born. This could reduce your need for an episiotomy, though it may not protect you from tears (Gupta et al 2012) .   Perineal massage during the last month of pregnancy may also help you avoid both an episiotomy and a tear. Just once a week or twice a week is enough to help loosen your perineal muscles ready for labour and birth. This will be most effective if you're trying for a VBAC (Beckmann and Garett 2006) . Is labour harder for older mums the second time around? Not necessarily. If you're over 40, you're more likely to experience certain complications and may need extra support (Utting and Bewley 2011) . But if you had a straightforward labour before, this one may still be quicker and easier than the first time.  There are plenty of positive reasons to have a baby later in life. Many women in their 40s go on to have trouble-free pregnancies and perfectly healthy babies. Your age means you’re probably more likely to be emotionally and financially ready for another baby too.  Take a sneak peek at our community, where mums have been discussing how their second labour was different from their first .  If you're wondering whether you'll love your new baby as much as your first, then you're not alone. Learn about other parents’ experiences of having another baby .

I've heard subsequent babies come sooner but I don't want to get my hopes up!! I had my son at 40w3d, I'd love if he came around 39 weeks so I could avoid induction! h  heatherdw0615 My first was a day late and my second was 2 weeks early, hoping this one is like #2 :-) j  janet6457 @shamika148  Interesting topic. I want to know too. My first was 40 weeks 4 days. S  Spergkamp My first was 40w 11 days and had to be induced. I'd love to avoid induction if possible this time. I've never heard of 2nd babies coming earlier than 1st ones but fingers crossed. 39 weeks would be lovely. z  zeegee5 I went into labour naturally with all my babies my 1st was born 40wks to the day, my 2nd +or - a day or 2 around due date (can't remember!) 3rd was at 39wks exactly (I did get a water infection with her that brought in contractions) and 4&5 came at 34+5 days hoping this one doesn't keep us waiting! m  maileeroc My first was born naturally at 37+1 weeks and my second 36+6! They were both healthy babies and Iv been given a high chance this one will also come at 37 weeks xx K  KEM011315 My first came 3 weeks early and my water broke at home. My second was a week late and I had to be induced by them breaking my water. Both were quick labors though with no drugs! l  lydy_82 My first came at 33 weeks, second at 37 + 3 and Im hoping this one stays put till 37 weeks s  shelbylynn989 My first baby was 6 days late, and I'm waiting to have my second baby now at 33 weeks. He just didn't want to wait! A  Audsplus1 My first baby was induced (cholestasis) at 37+5.  My second I went into labor on my own and she was born at 39+0.  Hoping for between 38-40 weeks for this one.  In afraid of how big she'll be if I go longer, my second was 9lbs 7oz a week early! k  karcarson @shamika148  I went into labour at 38 weeks with my first and m doc said most likely this baby will come 3 days to a week before that! a  akosuakate My second was later than my first, with an almost identical labor. 1st: 7 days late 24 hour labor 2nd: 9 days late 22 hour labor s  southernbellenc84 @shamika148  My first was the day after his due date. My daughter was the say before- second baby. a  abidgood My had 7 babies- first 6 were early anywhere from 1-3 weeks early baby # 7 was 1 week late c  christine0904 My first was a week late and I'm still carrying the second. What I'm curious about is the reasoning behind the second being early. Is it because your muscles and body are trained and know what to do? With my first my water broke but I never went into labour even with induction, so I ended up in c section. Since my body hasn't gone through labour I wonder if I am less likely to have this one early. s  sharkiecheetah I always thought your subsequent babies would come earlier too, just because your body knew what to do, the muscles had been stretched out, etc... Then I just watched a mom at my daughters school go 13 days overdue on her fourth! I felt so bad for her, she was miserable! I have had way stronger Braxton hicks this time and the babe has definitely dropped down low and I've lost my mucus plug (at 30 weeks, now 32.2) so I'm hoping she comes anytime after 37 weeks! A  Alicia824 My first tried to come at 34 weeks but we stopped labor.  He came on his own at 38 weeks and ended up a c section.  My second also tried to come at 34 weeks and was stopped. He made it to his scheduled c section at 39 weeks.  Good luck!

Reply  Close d  digiovana1 Ohh man! I was hoping everyone would say YES they come sooner lol Reply  Close C  CrinanBBL I think it depends on the baby, I've had 1 early baby (38w) and one late baby.. I really feel like this one will be early, he measures ahead and is dropping, not to mention I've been having real contractions since 19w.. The doctors can't figure out why they are happening, their best explanation is muscle memory, since I had a baby 8mo before conceiving this one. I really need him to come on my due date & no earlier because my husband is gone for work, I'm nervous!! LoL Reply  Close m  mbRN1367 My first came 9 days early, my second came 6 days early. So my first was earlier, even though I was doing so much more with my second to prepare my body for labor. Don't get your hopes up! Reply  Close l  ladyisabella Not the case for me either.

She said she is certain it will be next week, because I am dilating regularly but only having BH. I am currently 36+5 Reply  Close a  amyfranco28 With my first I was 2 weeks early, my second, I had to be induced 2 weeks past my due date. My third pregnancy (twins) they came really early, at 32 weeks. My forth came three weeks early. My 5th came 3 weeks early & fast!! I delivered him in the ambulance. With this pregnancy, I'm guessing I will probably be a few weeks early and the labor will be fast. My doc said if I go into to preterm labor, she is just going to keep me until the baby comes to avoid the baby being born in the ambulance & having any complications. Reply  Close t  teppe I keep wondering this too. I had my son 10 days early, so I'm not going to be happy if I go to 40+ weeks, haha. My friend was just induced at 41 weeks with her second, her first came on her due date. I'll die going to 41 weeks! One thing that should be mentioned- if your kids have different fathers. Fathers' genes determine a lot of the placental makeup which can influence when labor starts.

Reply  Close l  luvinmum I don't know about early, but both of mine were about a week late. Apparently I bake them for a long time... or they are comfy and don't want to come out.

As far as labor, my second was the hardest and longest labor and my third was so easy we almost didn't make it to the hospital. P  PandaFish87 My gosh I hope not, since ds came 4 wks early... S  Shawna682 @MixdMomma  My oldest came at 36wk 6d.  My second came at 38wk 4d and that's only because I had a scheduled c-section...I really think he would have stayed in there forever if not for the c-section. :) S  Stina29 @MixdMomma  I think it's probably different for everyone. However, my children all followed a pattern. First DS was 4 days over due, 7 hrs labor. Second DS 3 days over due, 5 hrs labor. Third DS 2 days over due, 2 hrs labor. DD was 2.5 weeks early, 9 hrs labor. *BUT my water broke at home, and DD's head came down fast and created a plug-that caused my water to not fully break-thus prolonging labor* DD2 is due in 10 weeks, and already OB says she'll be earlier than 2.5 weeks early, and labor will fly by-since we already know what to watch for if water does break on own at home.   M  MixdMomma It's amazing reading all of the diff patterns these babies have made! I hope this baby isn't later than my first bc I'm sooooo uncomfy and just overall ready! J  Junebug85 @MixdMomma  I don't know if its common or not but most women I've known have gone longer with their second with shorter deliveries. I was over a week past my due date with my son. That ended up in a csection, so weve scheduled a csection at 39 weeks for this one. I'm just hoping and praying she hangs in there till then. I'm 31 weeks, and already my stomach seems as big as I was when I delivered my son. I'm afraid she's going to try to come early!!

G  GiselaElizabeth @melanknnee  my first was born @ 39w5d, my second was induced at 41w3d. had short labors with both (3 hours, then 2 hours). j  jessika85 My first came right on time, his due date actually lol and our daughter, our second was induced. But labor with our daughter was MUCH shorter than with our son. k  katie0607 @melanknnee  I certainly hope so. My first was 10 days late so I hope this one comes well before that! 5  5thontheway2013 @melanknnee  I had my 1st at 37.5 weeks after 18 hrs labor and over 2 hrs pushing my 2nd was 37 weeks ...16 hrs labor and 45 min pushing my 3rd was 39weeks 1 day and was 24 hrs 38 min in labor and about 15-20 min pushing the only significant difference i noticed with mine was pushing time was pretty much cut in half every time and all my kids came before their due dates so idk if we can go by mine lol h  haribo_02 @melanknnee  my first was 2 weeks earily and my second was 1 week earily. for my first I pushed for 20 min and my second I pushed twice. labor was also shorter for #2, but it was very different: water breaking and being induced twice vs natural labor for #2 K  KissMyJax @5thontheway2013  I have NO memory for specifics but my first was 42 wks, and the next two were rite around 40 wks. The labor with each got shorter & pushing less time. My last came out b4 Dr was even ready! b  blonderubikscube @melanknnee  I'm curious about this, too, but I don't think it really matters (though it's nice to hear labors/pushing are usually shorter!). With my first, my water broke the day after my due date and she was born the next day. I have this "feeling" I won't make it to my due date with #2...but don't really have anything to base it on. I don't normally get "feelings" about things, though, so it's kind of strange (like - I really had no idea on the gender...though DH guessed right both times!). We shall see! K  Kirsty2012 My first was 12 days early and was 2 hours 55 minutes from first contraction to delivery. I'm being induced at 38 weeks with this one so we can ensure 1) that this baby is born in hospital and 2) that we can organize a sitter for dd  D  Dawn422 @melanknnee  I think every baby and pregnancy is different regardless of how many you've had previosly. My first was 5 days early and labored for 9 hours in the hospital. Second was 3 days early and labored for 1-2 hours in hospital. Third was 2 days late and labored for 12 hours in hospital. I am hoping #4 is early and quick, but you never know. H  HypMama76 @melanknnee  #1 was induced at 41 weeks, exactly. I had a 12 hour labor with her, and pushed for about 2.5 hours. #2 was born at home, 42 weeks 3 days. Labor was about 6 hours, and I think I pushed for maybe 30-45 minutes. I am hoping #3 is an easy, quick birth, but you never know. ;) D  DaniBlueEyes @melanknnee  My dr seems to think the second comes earlier and easier. Which is scary cause with my son my water broke at home 8 days before my due date so being a ftm I figured I had alot of time so I took a shower and got ready and took my time. He came alot faster than anyone expected. I only pushed for 20 mins (9lb 3oz baby!! Lol) and the total time from My water breaking til he was born was 7 hours and 15 mins! Everything went so well I just don't see how it'll be easier this time! m  melanknnee Thanks for your input ladies. With my son he came 9 days early, I was in labor for 9 hours and he was out in 2 pushes. I thought it was pretty good considering he was my first child, and I had heard all the stories on how long and hard women labored for with there first child. Iâ€™m still hoping my little girl will arrive a bit early lol. K  Kelzep21 @melanknnee  My first was 6 hours of labor and I delivered her at 37 weeks. My second was 6 hours of labor and I delivered him at 39 weeks! I feel its up to baby when they want to make their appearance!! :) R  RockMeMamma @HypMama76  Am I the only one who is nervous about a SHORT labor? With my first, I knew I had plenty of time to call my SO home to come get me, and get to the hospital, and have the epidural, and then call everyone to let them know it was time. Now with second baby, I am so scared that I will not have enough time to get DH home, and get to the hospital and get the epidural if I need it. I felt like I had more cushion room with the first! Watch, I will be the one who is in labor for 40 hours with the second one, cuz that is just my luck :) M  MommaAnna @melanknnee  i've never heard of baby actually coming EARLIER each time, just that each LABOR is shorter. :S My first was induced at about 42 weeks, and i was in labor for about 24hrs, but only pushed for 30min. I pray to God that this baby comes sooner than that, and labor is shorter!

Odds of going early the second time around? And what about L&D with #2?             newcreation08    Posted 09/23/2009       Hi Ladies,  Just curious if those of you who were early with your first also ended up being early with your second?  My DD  (dear daughter) arrived 8 days early and I'm feeling the same way towards this next little one in regards to going early. Has anyone gone later or overdue with their second when their first was early?  Also, I'm a little apprehensive about getting to the Birth Center in time this time, too. I labored at home with DD  (dear daughter) and didn't end up arriving at the Center until I was already 10cm! (Never thought I had a high pain tolerance, but maybe I do?! My contractions were rather irregular so I didn't realize how far along I really was...)  I've heard second children come much more quickly with a more intense labor. I really don't want to have this next one in the car. :-)  Any suggestions or experiences to share?     --  *Wife to DH, 3/2007* *Mommy to DD 3/2008, DD 11/2009 and a new little one due 5/23/2011*             Comment            Report this post        1          Comments (15)        / 2                   JoAnn3rd    Last edited 09/23/2009      I went about a week and a half early with my ODS, but I had high blood pressure and other issues that I didn't have with our MDS.  With MDS, I thought I had just overdone it, and didn't realize I was in the early stages of labor.  My labor with MDS progressed very quickly, so that coupled with the fact that I have an hour drive to the hospital meant that I arrived and was dialated to 7 and had him in an hour and a half!  He was born the day before his due date, so pretty much right on the money!  I don't think my labor was more intense.  In fact, I thought it went much easier than my first, (and I had an epidural with my first) but I knew what to expect, so that could have made a difference.  I think every time is different, but most people I've talked to had their labors progressively get shorter the more children they had.  I was induced for our YDS, so I don't know if that would be true for me or not, and I am going to be induced for this baby, so I guess I won't get to find out!:)  The only change I've noticed after having three children is that the cramping afterwards when your uterus is getting back down to size was worse with my second, and then worse with my third.  I think its because everything has been stretched out before, so it has more work to do - but its not unbearable or anything!:)  I hope that has helped you out!

My dd  (dear daughter) came two weeks early and I'm having a c-section. I'm gonna ask my doctor today. I want to take a tour of the maternity ward too but dd  (dear daughter) is sick so that will have to wait. Are you pre-registered yet?

I am curious to see how many women had their second baby at an earlier gestational age than the first. I've had 2 OBs and a midwife tell me that typically second babies come sooner and also quicker. I was going to ask on my birth board but then I realized I might offend a bunch of women for telling them that if they were induced for the first birth they need not respond. Lol. But obviously if you were induced you wouldn't really know when the first baby "should" have come.  I went into labor with my daughter at either 37 w 5 d or 37 w 6 d (is it bad I can't remember?) and it started with my water breaking and ended 8.5 hours later with her being born vaginally with no interventions, although I did get an epidural and consent to EFM (because I wasn't educated enough, mostly). Everyone is asking me if I think this baby will be early like my first, "on time" or late.  So... Poll time! And feel free to put details and exact dates in the comments.       --  Haley .

Baby #2 came at 42w exactly, and that labor was 3 hours. Both labors were spontaneous and there was no pitocin or anything used, but for the second I had my membranes swept a couple times like two days before contractions actually got started. I don't think that really started the labor though.  We are wondering if the pattern will hold and give us a one hour labor and a 42+week baby this time.

My first was 5 weeks early and my second was only 10 days early, so for me my second actually came later.  But I think everyone's different, and there's no way to tell until it happens!    --  We love our little Austin Sawyer born 2/27/2010 Mama to Sierra 9/19/2002 & Taylor 4/25/2005             Reply            Report this comment        1                     Aly79512    Posted 11/20/2009      My first was 3 weeks early, my second was 4 days early, my third was 10 days early, and my 4th was born on my due date!    --  Aly Mom of 5--- DD 7/95 DD 9/02  DS 5/06 DS 12/07 DS 3/10             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Sunshine_23    Posted 11/20/2009      I wouldn't count on that AT ALL!  1st babies can be early, 2nd babies can be late, 3rd babies can be even later.  Or is can be completely opposite from that.  In my case...yes...each baby was earlier than the last.  My first was born at exactly 42 weeks...to the day.  My 2nd was born at exactly 40 weeks...to the day...born on her due date.  My 3rd was born at exactly 38 weeks...to the day.  Now, do I expect this one to come at 36 weeks?  NO!  But you never know.  I expect a normal full term baby between 38-40 weeks.  If my doc wasn't planning to induce by 38-39 weeks, I would say he could even stay put till 41 weeks for all I know.  Doubtful...but every pregnancy is different.  So I wouldn't PLAN on anything unless you have a csection or induction date set.  I would just have your bags packed starting around 34 weeks...even though you could go before that or well after.    --  Austin Cade ~ 3/9/2010 ~ 6lbs even ~ 19.25" ~             Reply            Report this comment       0                      StumbleBunny    Posted 11/20/2009      I think that is just another old wives tale.  Babies come when they are ready, barring any complications.    --  Crystal Mom to Asa (7/3/99), Eli (6/5/03), ^^I^^ (1/9/09) & Cash (3/10/10) neverpromisecrazyababy.blogspot.com/             Reply            Report this comment        1                     mikki0920    Posted 11/20/2009      My first was one day early and my second was 6 days late.

They told me they'd like me to hit at least 38w this time, but they think I'll get pre-eclampsia again at the same or earlier time.  The worst part is it's another c-section and the hospital won't allow the Dr. to book the operating room any earlier than 4 weeks prior to anyone's due date, and then the c/s has to be scheduled no earlier than someone's 39th week.  So with me, I have to wait until 8/1 to get my c/s date which will be some where between 8/22 and 8/29, but my own Dr. thinks I'll actually be having the baby somewhere around 8/10 if things work out the same way -- and there's no way I can plan for that.  They just seem to unintentionally make us nuts.

So far no signs of anything happening which is great.

So if it helps I am willing to do it.     Were your first two children healthy otherwise for being earlier (esp your first)? My first was 32 weeks, then I had a miscarriage, and this one I'm 19 weeks now and am worried that I will have him really early. My daughter was small but healthy at 32 weeks, so just wondered about earlier babies.  I was supposed to get makena but my doctor doesn't pay for it up front to get reimbursed by my insurance and I can't afford it. So, I probably won't be getting the shot and will have to keep my fingers crossed.    --  ~Ash Lillie Jade born 4/29/10 (2 months early)             Reply            Report this comment       0                  babyilo   Posted 08/17/2014      I had my first at 36weeks,and my second I went 7 days over!!!

Are you having a boy or a girl? Have you picked a name? Did you hear about this great book (or great sleeping pillow or great technique to make your unborn baby smarter)? Above all, though, the question you get asked is: When are you due? The obvious answer is that you’re due on your “due date,” the magic day that your doctor calculated based on a standard 40-week pregnancy. But as it happens, the odds of delivering on your due date are extremely small. Only about 1 in 30 women give birth on their due date. You are more likely to give birth a week early than you are to give birth “on time.”  When do women really give birth?  The most likely birthdate is seven days early, according to a huge sample of birth information put together for the Globe by Brookings Institute researcher and WhenToExpect.com co-creator Matt Chingos.             Advertisement     These figures include not just “spontaneous” deliveries but also planned C-sections and planned inductions. It’s possible that these procedures, which are commonly performed in the week before the actual due date, account for some of the early births. Nevertheless, other researchers who have screened out planned births and looked just at spontaneous births have found a similar pattern , which suggests that babies still like to show up early, even when they’re uncoaxed.

Sign Up      Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here    First children tend to stay put for a little longer. On average, they show up two or three days early. Second and third children arrive five to six days early.            Does it matter if it’s a boy or a girl?   Sex doesn’t seem to matter much. Boys and girls arrive at roughly the same time.            How about younger moms vs. older moms?  The older you are, the more likely you are to give birth early. Teenage moms tend to give birth about three days early, while moms in their 40s trek to the hospital about a week in advance. Part of this is due to birth order, as teenage moms are much more likely to be carrying their first children.            Can these numbers tell me when I’m going to give birth?  Unfortunately, no. At best, they might give you a better sense of the odds and help you win some bets with friends. Still, if there is one clear lesson in the data, it’s this: don’t wait until the last minute. Pack your hospital bag, settle on a name, stock up on sleep, and make sure your friends and family are primed to help. Chances are, your baby is coming sooner than you think.

Read on to find out when your baby will make his appearance. By Lauren Picker from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print 7 Must-Know Truths About Due Dates RELATED:  A New Test Can Predict Your Actual Due Date Bet on Unpredictability As a journalist who's accustomed to meeting deadlines, I wasn't surprised when, during my first pregnancy, I went into labor on my due date. The second time around was another matter. My due date came and went. And went, and went, and went. It wasn't until the day before my doctor planned to induce me—at nearly 42 weeks pregnant —that I finally went into labor. My experience brought home one of the essential truths of pregnancy: Your due date is anything but predictable. Still, your doctor needs to determine one that's as accurate as possible so that any necessary tests are done at the correct time. "And knowing how far along you are makes it easier for your obstetrician to see that your baby is growing properly," explains ob-gyn Joanne Stone, M.D., coauthor of Pregnancy for Dummies . RELATED: How You'll Know if You're in Labor Wondering when to expect your new arrival? Find out now. The Dating Game To calculate your due date , your doctor will take the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), and add 280 days (the equivalent of 40 weeks). For example, if your last period started on September 1, your due date would be June 7. This method assumes that your period arrives like clockwork every 28 days. If your cycles are longer, you're likely to deliver later than your due date; if they're shorter, expect to deliver earlier. A first-trimester sonogram is more trustworthy. Your doctor measures the length of the fetus and size of the gestational sac. If these numbers don't match up with what your LMP would predict, she may adjust your due date. But even if your doctor can pinpoint your due date with laserlike precision, don't expect your baby to show up right on schedule. Because, for all the windows into your womb, no one really understands what triggers labor. One possible (but, as my experience shows, imperfect) predictor: your past performance. "Patients tend to repeat what they did in a previous pregnancy," says Iffath Hoskins, M.D., executive director of the Women's Service at the Memorial Health University Medical Center, in Savannah, Georgia. If you're a first-time mom, look at your mother's childbirth history. "If your mother delivered one week past her due date, you are more apt to deliver one week past your due date as well," explains Fredric D. Frigoletto, Jr., M.D., chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Sooner Than Expected Most women—about 80 percent—deliver sometime between 37 and 42 weeks. So where does that leave the other 20 percent? About 11 percent deliver prematurely. Experts aren't sure why some women go into labor early. Possible risk factors include carrying multiples or having an abnormally shaped uterus. There may also be a connection between preterm labor and an infection such as bacterial vaginosis. Even your build can play a role—women who weigh less than 110 pounds are at slightly higher risk. Waiting It Out Once you've passed your due date, you may wonder whether your baby will arrive later than 42 weeks, or post-term. While Caucasian women tend to have slightly longer pregnancies, as do women under 30, no one knows why some babies take their own sweet time. However, your baby's gender could be a clue: One study found that boy fetuses are more likely to go beyond their due date than girls. Beginning at 40 or 41 weeks, expect to undergo weekly, then twice-weekly, nonstress tests. If your pregnancy progresses beyond this point, there's a risk that the quality of the placenta will deteriorate, the amniotic-fluid level will decline, or that your baby will pass a bowel movement, known as meconium. "Babies begin to practice breathing, and they can aspirate the meconium into their lungs—causing postdelivery problems," Dr. Frigoletto says. In addition, because your baby is still growing, you're at higher risk of needing a C-section . For these reasons, your doctor may want to induce labor once you hit 42 weeks. Whether you give birth exactly on your due date—or in the weeks before or after—doesn't really matter in the long run. After all, you'll just be happy to meet your newborn whenever she arrives.

The Odds of Baby Arriving on Their Due Date?           Without a doubt, you’ve heard lots of conflicting information on what a due date actually is.  Most believe the due date is a deadline. If Baby doesn’t arrive on that date, she’s late. If Baby comes before then, she’s automatically “premature.”        Some have theorized that due dates are an invention of modern medicine, and have become an excuse for doctors to perform c-sections. While that’s not what we believe, we do know that due dates are often inaccurate .  Baby should not be expected to arrive on an exact day (unless you’ve scheduled a c-section).  In fact, Baby should not be rushed at all unless there’s a medical reason to do so. According to the March of Dimes , a non-profit that “works to end premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality:”  “Labor should be induced only for medical reasons to protect the health of you and your baby. If your pregnancy is healthy, it’s best to let labor begin on its own without inducing labor.” // MarchofDimes.org  Due Date Statistics  Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants.

What is the probability of spontaneous labor after 35 weeks?   Out of 11,1114 women, 8,464 went into labor spontaneously. This equals 76% of the total participants.   What is the probability of giving birth within X days of your due date?   Do babies come on their due dates? Not really, but they usually come sometime around it. Only 4.3% of babies arrived on their due date. Comparatively, 61.6% of non-induced babies arrive within one week of their due date.       What is the average length of pregnancy in weeks?    31.8% of babies were born at 40 weeks  25.7%  were born at 39 weeks  16.1% of babies were born at 41 weeks  13.5% were born at 38 weeks  6.4% were born at 37 weeks  2.8% were born at 36 weeks  2.1 % were born at 42 weeks  1.5% were born at 35 weeks  0.1% were born at 43 weeks.    What is the average length of pregnancy for subsequent births?   If your first baby comes early, will your second baby be early, too? If your second baby arrives late, does that mean your third will come late as well? According to the survey, on average, subsequent babies arrive 0.18 days later than the previous baby.  The average baby #2 came 0.44 days later than baby #1, based on 900 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.73 days earlier than baby #2, based on 187 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.58 days earlier than baby #1, based on 184 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.92 days earlier than baby #3, based on 50 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.19 days earlier than baby #2, based on 47 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.38 days earlier than baby #1, based on 48 mothers.    What is the length of pregnancy for first-time moms compared to second- and third-time moms?   On average, a first-time mom has her baby at 39 weeks 5 days. This is the equivalent of 54.8% of first-time moms giving birth on or before their due date compared to 56.7% of second-time moms, and 59.5% of third-time mothers.   Is there a connection between length of pregnancy and the type of delivery?    9% of the 8,670 women who went into labor spontaneously underwent a c-section.  19% of 2,343 women who were induced underwent a c-section.  Is there a correlation between induction and increased incidence of cesarean? You decide.   What is the relationship between the length of pregnancy and birth weight?   Are “late” babies huge? On average, “late” babies are generally bigger than “early” ones but not by much. The difference between a baby born at 39 weeks and one born at 41 weeks is about 300 grams.   What is the probability of induction after the due date?   Most doctors will induce a mom rather than let her get past her due date. According to the March of Dimes, however: “If your health care provider talks to you about inducing labor, ask if you can wait until at least 39 weeks to be induced. This gives your baby’s lungs and brain the time they need to fully grow and develop before he’s born.” // MarchofDimes.org   Is there a correlation between the age of the mother and the probability of spontaneous labor?   It has been theorized that the age of the mother has something to do with when labor sets in. Is it possible that the average due date would change depending on ethnicity, age or even country of origin? According to the survey, about the same number of women give birth on day 279 as 287.   Are more babies born on a full moon?   There is no correlation between the phase of the moon and when babies are born.   What is the most common day of the week for babies to be born?   According to the survey, the most common day for babies to be born is Thursday while the least common is Saturday.  Sunday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries and 1.6% induced births.  Monday 11% spontaneous deliveries and 3.2% induced births.  Tuesday 10.7% spontaneous deliveries 4.1% induced births.  Wednesday 10.9% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Thursday 13.1% spontaneous deliveries 4.5% induced births.  Friday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Saturday 10% spontaneous deliveries 2.3 % induced births.    What does it mean if I’m 40 weeks pregnant?   Congratulations! You’ve hit your due date and Baby is fully developed! Instead of stressing out that Baby’s not here yet, relax and enjoy the anticipation. 52% of the women surveyed were still pregnant at 40 weeks. 28.79% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 3 days (on or before 40W,3D). It’s normal to still be pregnant at this point. If your doctor or midwife is supportive of natural induction, consider these natural induction methods .  34.49% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 4 days (on or before 40W, 4D)  46.57% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 6 days (on or before 40W, 6D)  57.07% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 8 days (on or before 41W, 1D)  68.61% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 12 days (on or before 41W, 5D)  73.44% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 21 days (on or before 43W, 0D)  26.56% of babies were induced.    I know the exact date I conceived. Can I calculate my exact due date?   Typically, due dates have an 8- to 10-day variation as they are calculated from the last menstrual period, not date of conception. The question then arises, is it possible to calculate an exact due date based on conception date? According to the survey, the standard deviation does not improve even if you know the exact second your baby was conceived. Babies are individuals, just like adults. Some need more time in the womb than others.   Which babies are born earlier, boys or girls?   The average arrival time for babies of both sexes  is 39 weeks and 5 days.   Do inductions bias due date  statistics?   What if all the women who were induced were meant to give birth late? Doesn’t this change the average amount of time a pregnancy should last? Not really, according to the survey. If we assume each induction was actually a late birth, the average median would shift by 2 days.     First Published at www.spacefem.com.

En Español TUESDAY, July 12, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Women who give birth to their first child even a couple of weeks early  are up to three times more likely to deliver their next baby prematurely, new research suggests. "The magnitude of the increased risk surprised us --  it really is a potent factor," said senior study author  Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski. She is associate director of precision health with the University of California, San Francisco's Preterm Birth Initiative. For the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 160,000 women who gave birth in California between 2005 and 2011. The study authors defined "preterm" as birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation and "early term" birth at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant death and a major cause of life-long neurological issues, such as cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing loss, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. First, the researchers took other risk factors for premature birth into account -- such as illegal drug use during pregnancy, high blood pressure, diabetes and urinary tract infections. Still, the researchers found the risk for a subsequent premature delivery was two to three times higher for women who went into early term labor with their first baby. This finding held whether the women went into labor naturally or were induced due to a medical concern, the study found. Based on these findings, more women could be targeted for closer monitoring and treatments that could help reduce the risk for premature delivery during a second pregnancy, the researchers suggested. Of all the first-time deliveries included in the study, almost 6 percent of the women were preterm and would automatically be considered high-risk for another premature delivery. But the researchers noted that 22 percent of the women who delivered between 37 and 38 weeks of pregnancy would not have been labeled as high risk in the future under existing standards of care. "There are so few avenues to lower preterm birth rates, so I'm always thrilled when our work suggests an additional one," Jelliffe-Pawlowski said in a university news release.  The researchers added that women and their doctors should communicate more clearly so that women have a better understanding of prematurity and their risk of delivering early. The study findings were published July 11 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology . More information  The March of Dimes has more about premature babies .

DS was born at 37+5, and I am now 37 weeks with our second baby and freaking out that I could potentially be pregnant for another 4-5 weeks. While 37 is considered at term, I know there may be benefits to the little miss staying in a bit longer. But I have suddenly hit that insomnia/discomfort stage of things where I just want the baby to exit ASAP. Finding this pregnancy much more tiring now that I have a toddler to chase after.  Agh. Maybe I should have posted in venting! Thanks for listening.

  Babies second time around    Babies second time around   By Hannah Dahlen             “When are you going to have ‘number two’? You’re not going to let her be an only child? Don’t you think she needs a brother or sister?” Not only are we eventually asked these questions publicly by well meaning friends and relatives, but also at some point we begin to ask these same questions of ourselves privately as parents.  The decision to have more than one child is not an easy one for many parents. Australia’s fertility rate has declined dramatically over the last forty years and is now down to 1.7 children per family. Whilst having the first child fulfils those natural urges most of us have to be parents, having a second child for many parents seems to complete the family and most importantly provides a sibling for the first child. The decision to have a second child is not easy for everyone, neither is it always a conscious one. An unplanned second pregnancy can cause great turmoil, particularly if your first child is still a baby. You may still be trapped in that daze of sleepless nights and endless nappies and find it hard to comprehend that it will all start again in a few short months. Even when the second child is carefully planned, anxieties will surface and questions will need to be answered. Second time around as a parent you are suspended somewhere between a novice and an expert, and a dreamer and a realist.  Pregnancy second time around  Whist pregnancy the second time around is certainly familiar, it is rarely an identical experience to the first. Women often comment on how different each pregnancy is. Your body will also be slightly different second time around. The muscles of your abdomen are not as taught, you are likely to be a bit older and your life is most likely busier than it was when you were pregnant with the first baby.  Studies of differences in pregnancy symptoms between first time mothers and those having subsequent babies don’t show huge variations. Some symptoms, however, such as accidental leakage of urine with coughing or sneezing and dry skin are more likely to occur during a subsequent pregnancy. Stretch marks are reported less by women during a subsequent pregnancy than during their first. This is most likely due to the fact that all the stretching needed for subsequent pregnancies has already been done with the first baby. If, however, you have put on a lot of weight with the first baby and not lost it by the time you are pregnant again then the added weight gain can make you more prone to stretch marks.  If you had nausea and vomiting during your first pregnancy, you are more likely to have it in the next pregnancy, though the intensity may differ. The closer you have your babies together the more exaggerated the general aches and pains of pregnancy seem to be, such as a sore back and unstable feeling in your pelvis. Second time mothers are bending over picking up toys and lifting growing toddlers and this adds stress to vulnerable backs, joints and ligaments. You need to try and bend at the knees when you do these things rather than bending at the waist to reduce potential problems. If the aches and pains seem to be worst, in my experience mothers having second babies often tell me the pregnancy passes much quicker. We have less time to navel gaze when chasing a demanding child around the house.  Only you can decide when the best time is to get pregnant. Getting pregnant, however, in the first year following birth does put a big demand on your body. These women are more prone to getting anaemic and are more likely to need iron supplements during pregnancy. Discuss this with your care provider. You are likely to feel more tired during the second pregnancy, especially if your first child is still very young. You will have to try and snatch a nap when your child does.  Women having their second baby tend to feel the baby move earlier than women having their first baby. They are more likely to feel these movements at around 16 to 18 weeks compared to 18 to 22 weeks with their first. The most likely reason for this is they tend to recognise those first movements earlier. Women having their second baby are often surprised at how early they begin looking pregnant compared to their first experience. The maternity outfits do seem to be resorted to earlier. This is probably due to the fact that the abdominal muscles are not as toned as they were with the first and tend to allow the uterus to lean forwards a bit more. Unlike at the end of the first pregnancy women often find the baby’s head is less likely to go right down into their pelvis (engage). Sometimes this doesn’t happen until the labour actually begins.  If you had problems with your first pregnancy such as high blood pressure or premature labour you are at more risk of this occurring again and so will be watched closely for any potential problems. This doesn’t mean you will definitely have these problems again.  You may still be breastfeeding your first child and wondering what to do with another one on the way. It is a myth that breastfeeding while you are pregnant is harmful for either the breastfeeding child or the unborn baby. Concerns about harmful hormones in the milk or stimulating premature labour have not been supported by research. There is no reason why you cannot continue breastfeeding. Pregnancy is, however, the most likely time your child will wean or be easily weaned if this is your choice. Some children wean early in pregnancy because the breasts feel different, the quantity of milk decreases or the taste of the milk changes. Don’t be too insulted by an unexpected ‘yucky’ from your toddler. Later in pregnancy your expanding uterus may make feeding awkward and make your toddler lose interest. You may also find your breasts and nipples become very tender when you are pregnant.  Involving the first child in the pregnancy helps them to adjust to the concept of a new sibling easier. If you plan to have them present at the birth you need to start preparing them early. Make sure you have a support person organised for the child so they can be taken out of the situation if it distresses or bores them. The last thing you need when in labour is to be worrying about your child or have your partner unable to focus on you. If you plan not to have your child there for the birth remember to organise someone who will be on call during the last few weeks of the pregnancy.  Women having their second baby are less likely to attend parent education classes than they were with their first. Some hospitals run short, refresher, parent education courses for second time parents. You will best know what your needs are.  Birthing second time around  With the first baby you journey through a great unknown. You may have reasonable knowledge but you have no experience to draw on. With the second baby there is more of an understanding of what is going on. This does not mean you will have no anxieties. Sometimes the anxiety is in fact worse. With the first birth you can delude yourself but with the second you are forced to be a realist. If you had a hard time with the first baby you may in fact find you are more fearful than you were with your first. Many a second time mother has gripped my arm in labour and said “its all coming back to me now”. It is as if that protective amnesia that softens birth memories is rolled back with the first contraction. The reality is the second birth has a very high chance of being uncomplicated. Women often find the second birth helps to heal any disappointments they may have felt over the first birth experience.  The good news is second time around the labour is usually about half as long as the first and often it is even shorter than this (around 6 hours). If you had a normal vaginal birth with your first baby your chances of having this outcome again is around 96 percent. If you had a forceps delivery with your first birth you have over an 80 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth next time. Women who have a vacuum extraction (baby pulled out using a suction cup on the head) for the first birth have over a 91 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth with a following baby.  It is interesting to note that a recent study showed that while having a baby in posterior position (the back of the baby’s head lies against your spine) during the first labour and birth increases the incidence of forceps and caesarean section, it does not seem to have a major impact with the second baby. The baby seems to be able to turn easier and get itself into an anterior position (baby faces the mother’s spine).  Women who have a normal vaginal birth with their first child have a less than 2 percent chance of having a caesarean section with the second child. If you had a caesarean section for your first birth this does not mean you will need a caesarean with your second. Studies involving women who are allowed to try for a normal vaginal birth after a caesarean section indicate around 80 percent of these women go on to give birth vaginally and around 20 percent have another caesarean section. The risk of having a caesarean section, vacuum extraction or forceps delivery with the second child is lowest if the labour begins spontaneously and is highest if the labour is induced or augmented (sped up). This is great news for mothers embarking on a second pregnancy, particularly if they had to have assistance during the birth of their first baby. Women are often fearful that the second birth will be similar to the first birth.  If you had stitches in your perineum with the first baby, you are much less likely to need them, or need as many, second time around. This is despite the fact that second babies generally tend to be a little bit bigger than the first. Women having their second babies are also much less likely to need drugs for pain relief (pethidine, epidural) and cope much better with alternative methods of pain relief like showers, hot packs and massage. Giving birth second time around is pretty much all good news for most women.  Motherhood second time around  The ‘second child syndrome’ can be a remarkable relief and contrast to the first. Second babies often seem more settled and entertain or put themselves to sleep much easier than first babies do. This may be due to the fact that you are now a more seasoned mother and this confidence and common sense filters through to calm your child or it may be due to the fact that now there are two to care for you can’t focus as completely on the new baby as you could with the first. Perhaps we do practice our parenting skills on the first child and perfect them on subsequent children. You also tend to listen less to all the ‘experts’ second time around and listen more to yourself. The first time around you are determined to do it right! The second time around you realise this is an impossible task and you follow your instincts and draw on your own experience. There are of course plenty of exceptions to this rule and second time around you could get the more challenging child!  Breastfeeding is also generally not as difficult, particularly if you have successfully fed your first baby. If you did have problems with breastfeeding the first don't expect exactly the same problems with the second. Every baby is an individual. Don’t be surprised if the sight of you breastfeeding your new baby doesn’t rekindle memories and interest and even a little jealousy in your toddler. Some women continue to breastfeed their new baby and toddler at the same time. When this occurs toddlers can react with joy to the sudden flood of milk that comes in whilst others don’t appreciate the change. Breastfeeding can be a great way to make your toddler feel less threatened by the new baby and able to share your attention. On the other hand some women feel quite resentful over this huge demand on them. Remember whatever you do it must work for you!  Worrying how your first child will react to the new member of the family is a very natural process. The best way to minimise jealousy is to involve your first child in looking after the new baby. For some mothers there are feelings of guilt prior to the birth of a second child. They feel they are somehow being disloyal to their first-born and that the special relationship they have with them will be altered. Parents can also find it hard to imagine that they could possibly find room in their hearts to love another child as they do the first. The amazing thing about loving our children, however, is that love is so complete with each child, yet so limitless in it its capacity.

Is it safe to have 2nd child so early after c section       Rem   Dec 17, 2013  7:21pm  [ 9 ]     thank you for this article. Its re-assuring. My first birthing experience was horrible.  So bad, in fact that I've been put completely off s*x with my husband and hated him for months......hated him.  Wouldnt let him touch me - wanted him out the house and out my life - even though I do love him.  The mere thought of possibly going through all that again filled me with so much anxiety.  I love my little angel but any advances from poor hubby drove me insane.  Much more settled now -thank you       pruthvi   Feb 24, 2014  9:02am  [ 10 ]     Fantastic article.i'm pregnant for the second time and due in any moment now.
I always was worried about the labour and my first child.this article was as if my mind reader and has given answers to all my questions and consoled me with its fact presentations. Thank you very much for eradicating the anxiety in me.hats off.

Maria   Dec 1, 2014  1:06pm  [ 12 ]     why do people use these sites and comment boards to ask for help or cry please help me. Go see a Doctor and ask questions for yourself. Good grief.       Amanda   Jan 2, 2015  11:20am  [ 13 ]     Sitting here, 9 weeks pregnant, with tears in my eyes. My little ones will be incredibly close in age (14 months) - not planned but certainly welcomed. Reading this article gave me peace & strength - thank you!       Melissa   Mar 4, 2015  8:42am  [ 14 ]     Very reassuring article, thank you! I have a nearly 2 and a half year old and am 37 weeks pregnant with my second. I had a difficult labor with my first- she was posterior and I had TERRIBLE back labor for going on three days. Finally I gave in and accepted pitocin and an epidural just a few hours before my daughter was born. It was a disappointing and traumatic experience, as I'd planned a natural birth and was so close to succeeding! I'm doing a home birth this time and while I am less nervous than with my first because I have a better idea about what to expect, this one is also posterior and attempts to turn him have been unsuccessful so far. I'll admit, the idea of days of back labor terrifies me. The fact that labor will likely be shorter is such a relief. I know I can handle it, but not for two days again!!       Nikol   Jun 13, 2015  2:18am  [ 15 ]     I am 7 weeks thusfar and already my pregnancy is dramatically different than my first (6 years ago). I was horribly sick everyday with my daughter and she was underweight due to not being able to eat since 3 weeks pregnant with her. This time, I do have quite a bit of back pain and cramping, however, I have had no sickness! I crave good food and have turned away from anything boxed foods. Bottom line, the second time around has been completely different!
As for the negative nasty comment about women worrying and asking questions...not everyone believes in going all the way to the doctors office to ask a question we feel may or may not be anything at all. We are pregnant. Our emotions and worries are on high at this time. I tell my daughter there's no such thing as a stupid question, unless it's a question you already know the answer to. All others are reasonable and natural. Have some compassion for heavens sake.
Good luck to all pregnant mommies!       Johanna   Mar 4, 2016  2:43pm  [ 16 ]     I agree, this is such a positive article and at the same time honest. Thank you so much for this combination and outlook!! Much appreciated from a mom about to give birth for the second time!!       Stella   Apr 28, 2016  12:30am  [ 17 ]     I literally had the urge to hug my computer screen after reading this, especially the Birthing section!  This was so reassuring, thank you so much!       Jonath   May 17, 2016  8:07pm  [ 18 ]     Thank you so much for answering so many questions i had on my mind.....i am @ 28wks with #2 & have 2 yr old boy....i happen to be blessed with a lot of breast milk & i plan to tandem feed them; though i am worried if i'll be able to love the second one as much as the first one....

Second labors are usually easier, faster and more suited to a birth plan than a first. This is, of course, a generalization but one that is pretty consistent. Second babies are easier to deliver than first babies. Why? Lots of reasons: Our uteruses get smarter and figure out how to do the job. All the muscles, tissues and bones have already stretched out making it easier for the baby to descend. The trail has already been blazed and is easier to travel than one you have to create from scratch. Moms of first babies are birth-virgins. They've never done it before. They don't know yet if their anatomy and their babies are compatible for a vaginal birth. Most of the time they are. She doesn't know yet how long it will take for her uterus to contract enough to dilate her cervix and push that kiddo out. There's a lot of literature that says the average first labor is 12 hours but if I've said it once...babies never read that literature. Some take longer than others. A lot longer. There's always some debate as to when labor actually starts. The official word is labor starts when strong, regular contractions cause cervical change. It's not always possible to determine that exact moment. Lots of moms have strong, regular contractions for hours (days, weeks by some stories) that don't cause significant change. Try telling them they're not in labor. Most moms will argue, "I don't care what you say, labor started at 3:00 this morning." I'm going with Mom's story. My first took 30 hours—no matter how the obstetrician timed it. I went with my birth plan for the first 25. Once I finally tried some stuff that was "off plan," labor progressed rapidly and my daughter was born 5 hours later. The point is, first labors take a long time. A lot of thought and planning for exactly how you want your labor to go is a good idea, but keep in mind that as the hours drag out and progress is slower than you hoped for, birth plans frequently have to change. Second labors, however, are perfect for birth plans. If you've already successfully delivered a baby vaginally, you most likely will again. Your labor will be shorter (usually) and it's way easier to deal with contractions when your cervix is dilating quickly and the finish line is in sight. Let me get specific here. One of the most common items on a birth plan is "no pain medication or epidural under any circumstances." OK, that's not so tough with a second labor that's likely to be over fairly quickly (anywhere from 1-12 hours). That's a tougher target to hit when you've been contracting forever, have run out of coping mechanisms and are still only 3 centimeters dilated. Another popular item: "No pitocin to augment labor under any circumstances." With a second labor, there's frequently no need. They're way more efficient and don't tend to need much encouragement to keep the ball rolling. Item: Want to labor in the tub? Perfect! This works beautifully with firsts too but second labors are so much smoother that frequently, a little time in the tub is all the pain management needed before complete dilation. Heck, I've had seconds go so fast in the tub the water didn't have time to cool down. Item: Want to wait until you feel the urge before you push? No problem. If you've followed your birth plan request for no pain management, you probably don't have an epidural. Believe me, once you have that urge to push, no one's going to stop you. You won't have to wait for it either. Once the baby is on her way through the birth canal, your urge to push will be so strong, it's irresistable. Remember those two long hours of pushing with the first? Thing of the past. Seconds pop right out. I've delivered seconds myself whey they came so quickly, they shot out like cannon balls. I was grateful there was a wall behind me for support. Doctor? Midwife? No time. Just snap on the gloves and catch. That hardly ever happens with a first. Some birth planning with the first is an important part of preparing for labor along with prenatal classes and a healthy dose of reading. Just please, remember that you're a birth-virgin and plan for flexibility. We're going to do everything in our power to help you achieve the birth of your dreams. We're all for birth plans but those of us who've been doing this for a while are more realistic than some first time parents. We know that plans sometimes have to change. It's an important first step in parenting. You'll raise the child you deliver, not the one you planned on. They might, or might not, be the same child. Most of the time, the child you birth is far and away better than anyone you've ever dreamed of. Best laid plans... Got a question for Jeanne?

  Babies second time around    Babies second time around   By Hannah Dahlen             “When are you going to have ‘number two’? You’re not going to let her be an only child? Don’t you think she needs a brother or sister?” Not only are we eventually asked these questions publicly by well meaning friends and relatives, but also at some point we begin to ask these same questions of ourselves privately as parents.  The decision to have more than one child is not an easy one for many parents. Australia’s fertility rate has declined dramatically over the last forty years and is now down to 1.7 children per family. Whilst having the first child fulfils those natural urges most of us have to be parents, having a second child for many parents seems to complete the family and most importantly provides a sibling for the first child. The decision to have a second child is not easy for everyone, neither is it always a conscious one. An unplanned second pregnancy can cause great turmoil, particularly if your first child is still a baby. You may still be trapped in that daze of sleepless nights and endless nappies and find it hard to comprehend that it will all start again in a few short months. Even when the second child is carefully planned, anxieties will surface and questions will need to be answered. Second time around as a parent you are suspended somewhere between a novice and an expert, and a dreamer and a realist.  Pregnancy second time around  Whist pregnancy the second time around is certainly familiar, it is rarely an identical experience to the first. Women often comment on how different each pregnancy is. Your body will also be slightly different second time around. The muscles of your abdomen are not as taught, you are likely to be a bit older and your life is most likely busier than it was when you were pregnant with the first baby.  Studies of differences in pregnancy symptoms between first time mothers and those having subsequent babies don’t show huge variations. Some symptoms, however, such as accidental leakage of urine with coughing or sneezing and dry skin are more likely to occur during a subsequent pregnancy. Stretch marks are reported less by women during a subsequent pregnancy than during their first. This is most likely due to the fact that all the stretching needed for subsequent pregnancies has already been done with the first baby. If, however, you have put on a lot of weight with the first baby and not lost it by the time you are pregnant again then the added weight gain can make you more prone to stretch marks.  If you had nausea and vomiting during your first pregnancy, you are more likely to have it in the next pregnancy, though the intensity may differ. The closer you have your babies together the more exaggerated the general aches and pains of pregnancy seem to be, such as a sore back and unstable feeling in your pelvis. Second time mothers are bending over picking up toys and lifting growing toddlers and this adds stress to vulnerable backs, joints and ligaments. You need to try and bend at the knees when you do these things rather than bending at the waist to reduce potential problems. If the aches and pains seem to be worst, in my experience mothers having second babies often tell me the pregnancy passes much quicker. We have less time to navel gaze when chasing a demanding child around the house.  Only you can decide when the best time is to get pregnant. Getting pregnant, however, in the first year following birth does put a big demand on your body. These women are more prone to getting anaemic and are more likely to need iron supplements during pregnancy. Discuss this with your care provider. You are likely to feel more tired during the second pregnancy, especially if your first child is still very young. You will have to try and snatch a nap when your child does.  Women having their second baby tend to feel the baby move earlier than women having their first baby. They are more likely to feel these movements at around 16 to 18 weeks compared to 18 to 22 weeks with their first. The most likely reason for this is they tend to recognise those first movements earlier. Women having their second baby are often surprised at how early they begin looking pregnant compared to their first experience. The maternity outfits do seem to be resorted to earlier. This is probably due to the fact that the abdominal muscles are not as toned as they were with the first and tend to allow the uterus to lean forwards a bit more. Unlike at the end of the first pregnancy women often find the baby’s head is less likely to go right down into their pelvis (engage). Sometimes this doesn’t happen until the labour actually begins.  If you had problems with your first pregnancy such as high blood pressure or premature labour you are at more risk of this occurring again and so will be watched closely for any potential problems. This doesn’t mean you will definitely have these problems again.  You may still be breastfeeding your first child and wondering what to do with another one on the way. It is a myth that breastfeeding while you are pregnant is harmful for either the breastfeeding child or the unborn baby. Concerns about harmful hormones in the milk or stimulating premature labour have not been supported by research. There is no reason why you cannot continue breastfeeding. Pregnancy is, however, the most likely time your child will wean or be easily weaned if this is your choice. Some children wean early in pregnancy because the breasts feel different, the quantity of milk decreases or the taste of the milk changes. Don’t be too insulted by an unexpected ‘yucky’ from your toddler. Later in pregnancy your expanding uterus may make feeding awkward and make your toddler lose interest. You may also find your breasts and nipples become very tender when you are pregnant.  Involving the first child in the pregnancy helps them to adjust to the concept of a new sibling easier. If you plan to have them present at the birth you need to start preparing them early. Make sure you have a support person organised for the child so they can be taken out of the situation if it distresses or bores them. The last thing you need when in labour is to be worrying about your child or have your partner unable to focus on you. If you plan not to have your child there for the birth remember to organise someone who will be on call during the last few weeks of the pregnancy.  Women having their second baby are less likely to attend parent education classes than they were with their first. Some hospitals run short, refresher, parent education courses for second time parents. You will best know what your needs are.  Birthing second time around  With the first baby you journey through a great unknown. You may have reasonable knowledge but you have no experience to draw on. With the second baby there is more of an understanding of what is going on. This does not mean you will have no anxieties. Sometimes the anxiety is in fact worse. With the first birth you can delude yourself but with the second you are forced to be a realist. If you had a hard time with the first baby you may in fact find you are more fearful than you were with your first. Many a second time mother has gripped my arm in labour and said “its all coming back to me now”. It is as if that protective amnesia that softens birth memories is rolled back with the first contraction. The reality is the second birth has a very high chance of being uncomplicated. Women often find the second birth helps to heal any disappointments they may have felt over the first birth experience.  The good news is second time around the labour is usually about half as long as the first and often it is even shorter than this (around 6 hours). If you had a normal vaginal birth with your first baby your chances of having this outcome again is around 96 percent. If you had a forceps delivery with your first birth you have over an 80 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth next time. Women who have a vacuum extraction (baby pulled out using a suction cup on the head) for the first birth have over a 91 percent chance of having a normal vaginal birth with a following baby.  It is interesting to note that a recent study showed that while having a baby in posterior position (the back of the baby’s head lies against your spine) during the first labour and birth increases the incidence of forceps and caesarean section, it does not seem to have a major impact with the second baby. The baby seems to be able to turn easier and get itself into an anterior position (baby faces the mother’s spine).  Women who have a normal vaginal birth with their first child have a less than 2 percent chance of having a caesarean section with the second child. If you had a caesarean section for your first birth this does not mean you will need a caesarean with your second. Studies involving women who are allowed to try for a normal vaginal birth after a caesarean section indicate around 80 percent of these women go on to give birth vaginally and around 20 percent have another caesarean section. The risk of having a caesarean section, vacuum extraction or forceps delivery with the second child is lowest if the labour begins spontaneously and is highest if the labour is induced or augmented (sped up). This is great news for mothers embarking on a second pregnancy, particularly if they had to have assistance during the birth of their first baby. Women are often fearful that the second birth will be similar to the first birth.  If you had stitches in your perineum with the first baby, you are much less likely to need them, or need as many, second time around. This is despite the fact that second babies generally tend to be a little bit bigger than the first. Women having their second babies are also much less likely to need drugs for pain relief (pethidine, epidural) and cope much better with alternative methods of pain relief like showers, hot packs and massage. Giving birth second time around is pretty much all good news for most women.  Motherhood second time around  The ‘second child syndrome’ can be a remarkable relief and contrast to the first. Second babies often seem more settled and entertain or put themselves to sleep much easier than first babies do. This may be due to the fact that you are now a more seasoned mother and this confidence and common sense filters through to calm your child or it may be due to the fact that now there are two to care for you can’t focus as completely on the new baby as you could with the first. Perhaps we do practice our parenting skills on the first child and perfect them on subsequent children. You also tend to listen less to all the ‘experts’ second time around and listen more to yourself. The first time around you are determined to do it right! The second time around you realise this is an impossible task and you follow your instincts and draw on your own experience. There are of course plenty of exceptions to this rule and second time around you could get the more challenging child!  Breastfeeding is also generally not as difficult, particularly if you have successfully fed your first baby. If you did have problems with breastfeeding the first don't expect exactly the same problems with the second. Every baby is an individual. Don’t be surprised if the sight of you breastfeeding your new baby doesn’t rekindle memories and interest and even a little jealousy in your toddler. Some women continue to breastfeed their new baby and toddler at the same time. When this occurs toddlers can react with joy to the sudden flood of milk that comes in whilst others don’t appreciate the change. Breastfeeding can be a great way to make your toddler feel less threatened by the new baby and able to share your attention. On the other hand some women feel quite resentful over this huge demand on them. Remember whatever you do it must work for you!  Worrying how your first child will react to the new member of the family is a very natural process. The best way to minimise jealousy is to involve your first child in looking after the new baby. For some mothers there are feelings of guilt prior to the birth of a second child. They feel they are somehow being disloyal to their first-born and that the special relationship they have with them will be altered. Parents can also find it hard to imagine that they could possibly find room in their hearts to love another child as they do the first. The amazing thing about loving our children, however, is that love is so complete with each child, yet so limitless in it its capacity.      From the Australian College of Midwives Presidents report December 2010.   Dr Hannah Dahlen is the Associate Professor of Midwifery at the     University of Western Sydney.

Thank you for putting the answers to many of my second pregnancy and labor questions in one place!       Sarah   Jun 16, 2013  12:51am  [ 5 ]     How refreshing to read such a positive yet factual article. Thanks and well done. Exactly what I needed to read currently  being 7 days overdue with my second.       Peta   Jul 20, 2013  5:52pm  [ 6 ]     This is a great article, thank you. I'm just about to have my second baby and feel so much more relaxed after reading this.

Is it safe to have 2nd child so early after c section       Rem   Dec 17, 2013  7:21pm  [ 9 ]     thank you for this article. Its re-assuring. My first birthing experience was horrible.  So bad, in fact that I've been put completely off s*x with my husband and hated him for months......hated him.  Wouldnt let him touch me - wanted him out the house and out my life - even though I do love him.  The mere thought of possibly going through all that again filled me with so much anxiety.  I love my little angel but any advances from poor hubby drove me insane.  Much more settled now -thank you       pruthvi   Feb 24, 2014  9:02am  [ 10 ]     Fantastic article.i'm pregnant for the second time and due in any moment now.
I always was worried about the labour and my first child.this article was as if my mind reader and has given answers to all my questions and consoled me with its fact presentations. Thank you very much for eradicating the anxiety in me.hats off.

Maria   Dec 1, 2014  1:06pm  [ 12 ]     why do people use these sites and comment boards to ask for help or cry please help me. Go see a Doctor and ask questions for yourself. Good grief.       Amanda   Jan 2, 2015  11:20am  [ 13 ]     Sitting here, 9 weeks pregnant, with tears in my eyes. My little ones will be incredibly close in age (14 months) - not planned but certainly welcomed. Reading this article gave me peace & strength - thank you!       Melissa   Mar 4, 2015  8:42am  [ 14 ]     Very reassuring article, thank you! I have a nearly 2 and a half year old and am 37 weeks pregnant with my second. I had a difficult labor with my first- she was posterior and I had TERRIBLE back labor for going on three days. Finally I gave in and accepted pitocin and an epidural just a few hours before my daughter was born. It was a disappointing and traumatic experience, as I'd planned a natural birth and was so close to succeeding! I'm doing a home birth this time and while I am less nervous than with my first because I have a better idea about what to expect, this one is also posterior and attempts to turn him have been unsuccessful so far. I'll admit, the idea of days of back labor terrifies me. The fact that labor will likely be shorter is such a relief. I know I can handle it, but not for two days again!!       Nikol   Jun 13, 2015  2:18am  [ 15 ]     I am 7 weeks thusfar and already my pregnancy is dramatically different than my first (6 years ago). I was horribly sick everyday with my daughter and she was underweight due to not being able to eat since 3 weeks pregnant with her. This time, I do have quite a bit of back pain and cramping, however, I have had no sickness! I crave good food and have turned away from anything boxed foods. Bottom line, the second time around has been completely different!
As for the negative nasty comment about women worrying and asking questions...not everyone believes in going all the way to the doctors office to ask a question we feel may or may not be anything at all. We are pregnant. Our emotions and worries are on high at this time. I tell my daughter there's no such thing as a stupid question, unless it's a question you already know the answer to. All others are reasonable and natural. Have some compassion for heavens sake.
Good luck to all pregnant mommies!       Johanna   Mar 4, 2016  2:43pm  [ 16 ]     I agree, this is such a positive article and at the same time honest. Thank you so much for this combination and outlook!! Much appreciated from a mom about to give birth for the second time!!       Stella   Apr 28, 2016  12:30am  [ 17 ]     I literally had the urge to hug my computer screen after reading this, especially the Birthing section!  This was so reassuring, thank you so much!       Jonath   May 17, 2016  8:07pm  [ 18 ]     Thank you so much for answering so many questions i had on my mind.....i am @ 28wks with #2 & have 2 yr old boy....i happen to be blessed with a lot of breast milk & i plan to tandem feed them; though i am worried if i'll be able to love the second one as much as the first one....

By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | July 15, 2013 04:42pm ET                            MORE           A newborn baby  Credit: Newborn baby via Shutterstock     The world is eagerly awaiting the birth of the royal baby, but considering this is Kate Middleton's first pregnancy, is the baby likely to be late?  Buckingham Palace has not provided an official due date for the baby but has said the newborn is expected in mid-July.  Babies don't always arrive when they're supposed to, and mothers often say firstborns tend to be late, although this conclusion is typically based on anecdotal reports. [See 11 Big Fat Pregnancy Myths ].  Recently, Allen Downey, a professor of computer science at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass., did an analysis to find out if there was any truth to this old wives' tale. Downey studied a 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of 7,643 women, who reported 9,148 live births.  He found that first babies were, indeed, slightly more likely to be born late , at 41 weeks or later, compared with other babies (second-borns, third-borns, etc.)  The results showed that a firstborn baby has a 15 to 16 percent chance of being born late, compared with a 9 or 10 percent chance for other babies. Most babies were born at 39 weeks of pregnancy.  However, the study also found that firstborns were also more likely to be born early, at 37 weeks or earlier.  So, in general, firstborns were less likely to be born on time, said Downey, who is the author of " Think Stats " (O'Reilly Media, 2011). It's possible that first babies may be less likely to be on time because the date of conception is not accurate, Downey said.  Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of ambulatory care, obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., noted that a baby's due date is an estimate, and it's normal for babies to arrive two weeks before or after that day. Therefore, although parents may perceive a baby to be "late" if it arrives two weeks after the due date, this is not really the case.  "When you're expecting a first baby...you're locked on to the due date, and you expect the baby on that due date," Rabin said. But even if a woman thinks she knows exactly when she conceived, "it still can be two weeks high or low, and it's considered normal," she added.  Rabin said there is no known biological reason why firstborn babies would be more likely to be early or late.  After 42 weeks of pregnancy, a baby is considered overdue, Rabin said, and doctors become concerned about complications, such as an aging placenta that is not able to deliver proper nutrition to the baby.   According to the Mayo Clinic , a woman may be more likely to have an overdue baby if the baby is male. Will the royal heir be a boy?   Follow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner .

Scared about going into labour? You're not alone.    As your pregnancy nears its end, you’ll probably be thinking about what happened during your first labour and birth. It’s only natural to make comparisons and wonder if it will be the same this time around.  If you had a good experience, you're likely to be feeling relaxed about what's to come. But if you had a bad experience, or if you've had a long gap between your pregnancies, you may be feeling nervous. Find out what to expect this time around. Will my labour be different this time? You may find that your baby’s head engages in your pelvis later than it did in your first pregnancy. In fact, it may not engage until you go into labour (Viccars 2009) , when the contractions start to push your baby down into your pelvis.  Your contractions may become stronger more quickly than the first time around, and open up your cervix faster. Unless you had a caesarean, it will probably be easier for your baby's head to pass through the birth canal. This is because your pelvic floor muscles and the elastic walls of your vagina have been stretched before.  Your labour is also likely to be much shorter this time around. For first-time mums, the active first stage of labour (where the cervix dilates from 4cm to 10cm), lasts an average of eight hours, and is unlikely to last longer than 18 hours. For women who've had a baby before, the average is five hours, and it's unlikely to last longer than 12 hours (NCCWCH 2014) . Your pushing stage is likely to last under two hours, compared with three hours for first-time mums (NCCWCH 2014) .  My last labour was difficult. Will it be easier this time? Every labour is different. Many mums who have had a negative birth experience go on to have a positive one. Plus, this time around you know what to expect, so you're more able to prepare yourself for the birth. This in itself may reassure you.  If you're worried, you may find that writing a detailed birth plan helps you feel more in control. Although a birth plan can't cover all possible eventualities, it lets you lay out your hopes for the birth. This way your doctor or midwife and your birth partner know exactly what you want to happen. Your midwife will be happy to help you work out your preferences.  It’s important to talk through any concerns you have about labour. Your midwife , obstetrician or antenatal teacher will be able to give you plenty of advice and support.  Going through your birth notes with your midwife or doctor may also help you to understand what happened last time. You can request a copy of your labour notes by writing to the medical records department of your local hospital.  Many maternity departments offer a debriefing or listening service for women who have had a difficult birth . This can provide important reassurance and give you an extra chance to talk through any worries you may have. Contact your local unit to see what's available where you live. Can I choose where to have my next baby? As long as you're healthy, your pregnancy's going well, and your first labour was straightforward, you should be able to choose where to give birth .  If you're considering a home birth, this may be a better option for you than it was last time. Experts generally recommend that first-time mums give birth in a birth centre or hospital, as these are safest for the baby. But if you've given birth before, it's just as safe to have your baby at home (NCCWCH 2014) .  You're also less likely to have any kind of medical intervention at home compared with hospital. The same is true of giving birth at a birth centre or midwife-led unit (NCCWCH 2014) .  However, if you have a medical condition or had a complicated birth the first time around, a hospital birth is probably safest for you and your baby (NCCWCH 2007) . If you're hoping for a natural birth, try to select a hospital with low intervention rates, if possible. You should be able to find the information online, or you can ask your midwife for help.

If you had a caesarean section with your first baby, but are keen to have a vaginal birth this time, the odds are in your favour (RCOG 2007) . This is especially true if the reason you had a caesarean was specific to your last pregnancy. For example if your baby was breech or you had pre-eclampsia .  As long as your pregnancy is going well this time, your obstetrician is likely to support you in planning for a vaginal birth after caesarean ( VBAC ). About three out of four women who try for a VBAC go on to have a vaginal birth (RCOG 2007) . What if my baby arrived early last time? If you’ve had a baby prematurely before, this doesn't necessarily mean your next baby will be early too. However, it is more likely. There is about a one in five chance that you'll have another premature birth (Esplin et al 2008) . Every birth is different though, and there's still a four out of five chance that your baby will be full-term.  The odds change a little according to your circumstances. You may be slightly more likely to give birth prematurely this time if:   your last birth was very early, between 20 weeks and 31 weeks you've given birth prematurely twice before (Dodd et al 2013) If your labour does start prematurely this time, you'll probably recognise the signs straight away. Getting to hospital as soon as possible is the best thing for you and your baby. Will I have a bigger baby? There's evidence that second babies tend to be bigger than first babies (Swamy et al 2010) . But this isn't always the case.  If you've previously given birth to a large baby weighing 4.5kg (10lb) or more, you’re more likely to have a large baby this time (Heiskanen et al 2006, Walsh et al 2007) . But second babies are, on average, only 138g (5oz) heavier, which is about the same weight as a deck of playing cards (Wilcox et al 1996) .  To get an idea of your baby’s size and weight, your midwife will measure your bump with a tape measure during your antenatal appointments . If she has any concerns, she may book you in for an ultrasound scan to find out more. How can I prevent an episiotomy or tear? If you had a tear or an episiotomy with your first baby, try to use upright positions for pushing in the second stage of labour.  Using upright positions means gravity will help your baby to be born. This could reduce your need for an episiotomy, though it may not protect you from tears (Gupta et al 2012) .   Perineal massage during the last month of pregnancy may also help you avoid both an episiotomy and a tear. Just once a week or twice a week is enough to help loosen your perineal muscles ready for labour and birth. This will be most effective if you're trying for a VBAC (Beckmann and Garett 2006) . Is labour harder for older mums the second time around? Not necessarily. If you're over 40, you're more likely to experience certain complications and may need extra support (Utting and Bewley 2011) . But if you had a straightforward labour before, this one may still be quicker and easier than the first time.  There are plenty of positive reasons to have a baby later in life. Many women in their 40s go on to have trouble-free pregnancies and perfectly healthy babies. Your age means you’re probably more likely to be emotionally and financially ready for another baby too.  Take a sneak peek at our community, where mums have been discussing how their second labour was different from their first .  If you're wondering whether you'll love your new baby as much as your first, then you're not alone. Learn about other parents’ experiences of having another baby .

This time, I was in the hospital at 30 weeks for preterm labor, went back again the other night with contractions at 33 weeks. Hoping to keep him in until I'm 37 weeks, but he's made it clear he's coming on his time. j  justiceldorminey Interested in this too. I've heard subsequent babies come sooner but I don't want to get my hopes up!! I had my son at 40w3d, I'd love if he came around 39 weeks so I could avoid induction! h  heatherdw0615 My first was a day late and my second was 2 weeks early, hoping this one is like #2 :-) j  janet6457 @shamika148  Interesting topic. I want to know too. My first was 40 weeks 4 days. S  Spergkamp My first was 40w 11 days and had to be induced. I'd love to avoid induction if possible this time. I've never heard of 2nd babies coming earlier than 1st ones but fingers crossed. 39 weeks would be lovely. z  zeegee5 I went into labour naturally with all my babies my 1st was born 40wks to the day, my 2nd +or - a day or 2 around due date (can't remember!) 3rd was at 39wks exactly (I did get a water infection with her that brought in contractions) and 4&5 came at 34+5 days hoping this one doesn't keep us waiting! m  maileeroc My first was born naturally at 37+1 weeks and my second 36+6! They were both healthy babies and Iv been given a high chance this one will also come at 37 weeks xx K  KEM011315 My first came 3 weeks early and my water broke at home. My second was a week late and I had to be induced by them breaking my water. Both were quick labors though with no drugs! l  lydy_82 My first came at 33 weeks, second at 37 + 3 and Im hoping this one stays put till 37 weeks s  shelbylynn989 My first baby was 6 days late, and I'm waiting to have my second baby now at 33 weeks. He just didn't want to wait! A  Audsplus1 My first baby was induced (cholestasis) at 37+5.  My second I went into labor on my own and she was born at 39+0.  Hoping for between 38-40 weeks for this one.  In afraid of how big she'll be if I go longer, my second was 9lbs 7oz a week early! k  karcarson @shamika148  I went into labour at 38 weeks with my first and m doc said most likely this baby will come 3 days to a week before that! a  akosuakate My second was later than my first, with an almost identical labor. 1st: 7 days late 24 hour labor 2nd: 9 days late 22 hour labor s  southernbellenc84 @shamika148  My first was the day after his due date. My daughter was the say before- second baby. a  abidgood My had 7 babies- first 6 were early anywhere from 1-3 weeks early baby # 7 was 1 week late c  christine0904 My first was a week late and I'm still carrying the second. What I'm curious about is the reasoning behind the second being early. Is it because your muscles and body are trained and know what to do? With my first my water broke but I never went into labour even with induction, so I ended up in c section. Since my body hasn't gone through labour I wonder if I am less likely to have this one early. s  sharkiecheetah I always thought your subsequent babies would come earlier too, just because your body knew what to do, the muscles had been stretched out, etc... Then I just watched a mom at my daughters school go 13 days overdue on her fourth! I felt so bad for her, she was miserable! I have had way stronger Braxton hicks this time and the babe has definitely dropped down low and I've lost my mucus plug (at 30 weeks, now 32.2) so I'm hoping she comes anytime after 37 weeks! A  Alicia824 My first tried to come at 34 weeks but we stopped labor.  He came on his own at 38 weeks and ended up a c section.  My second also tried to come at 34 weeks and was stopped. He made it to his scheduled c section at 39 weeks.  Good luck!

Reply  Close d  digiovana1 Ohh man! I was hoping everyone would say YES they come sooner lol Reply  Close C  CrinanBBL I think it depends on the baby, I've had 1 early baby (38w) and one late baby.. I really feel like this one will be early, he measures ahead and is dropping, not to mention I've been having real contractions since 19w.. The doctors can't figure out why they are happening, their best explanation is muscle memory, since I had a baby 8mo before conceiving this one. I really need him to come on my due date & no earlier because my husband is gone for work, I'm nervous!! LoL Reply  Close m  mbRN1367 My first came 9 days early, my second came 6 days early. So my first was earlier, even though I was doing so much more with my second to prepare my body for labor. Don't get your hopes up! Reply  Close l  ladyisabella Not the case for me either.

I am currently 36+5 Reply  Close a  amyfranco28 With my first I was 2 weeks early, my second, I had to be induced 2 weeks past my due date. My third pregnancy (twins) they came really early, at 32 weeks. My forth came three weeks early. My 5th came 3 weeks early & fast!! I delivered him in the ambulance. With this pregnancy, I'm guessing I will probably be a few weeks early and the labor will be fast. My doc said if I go into to preterm labor, she is just going to keep me until the baby comes to avoid the baby being born in the ambulance & having any complications. Reply  Close t  teppe I keep wondering this too. I had my son 10 days early, so I'm not going to be happy if I go to 40+ weeks, haha. My friend was just induced at 41 weeks with her second, her first came on her due date. I'll die going to 41 weeks! One thing that should be mentioned- if your kids have different fathers. Fathers' genes determine a lot of the placental makeup which can influence when labor starts.

Reply  Close l  luvinmum I don't know about early, but both of mine were about a week late. Apparently I bake them for a long time... or they are comfy and don't want to come out.

I'm due Feb 25 and hubby actually told baby he had to wait until after vday to come so now I'm convinced he's coming Valentine's Day just to spite hubby. (Hubby wants vday sex).

Reply  Close L  LittleLeaves Anything over 37 weeks is not really considered early, they're all term. If you have one earlier than 37 weeks though, your chance of another preterm baby goes up. Reply  Close R  RainshadowNoba @LittleLeaves  New research is considering before 39wks to be "early term". Before 37 is "preterm". A term pregnancy is anything between 39-41wks. Post term at 42wks.

A  ALine4411 @MixdMomma  When my mom had my older brother, younger sister and me, my brother was a week early(her first), I was 2 weeks late(her second), and she had a scheduled c section with my sister(her third)! D  DandG @MixdMomma  I am a FTM but from my mother's experience, she was 8 days late with my older brother and 10 days late with me. c  caffeinej @MixdMomma  My first was born 2 days after due date, second was 1 day after due date, and my third 3 days early. As far as labor, my second was the hardest and longest labor and my third was so easy we almost didn't make it to the hospital. P  PandaFish87 My gosh I hope not, since ds came 4 wks early... S  Shawna682 @MixdMomma  My oldest came at 36wk 6d.  My second came at 38wk 4d and that's only because I had a scheduled c-section...I really think he would have stayed in there forever if not for the c-section. :) S  Stina29 @MixdMomma  I think it's probably different for everyone. However, my children all followed a pattern. First DS was 4 days over due, 7 hrs labor. Second DS 3 days over due, 5 hrs labor. Third DS 2 days over due, 2 hrs labor. DD was 2.5 weeks early, 9 hrs labor. *BUT my water broke at home, and DD's head came down fast and created a plug-that caused my water to not fully break-thus prolonging labor* DD2 is due in 10 weeks, and already OB says she'll be earlier than 2.5 weeks early, and labor will fly by-since we already know what to watch for if water does break on own at home.   M  MixdMomma It's amazing reading all of the diff patterns these babies have made! I hope this baby isn't later than my first bc I'm sooooo uncomfy and just overall ready! J  Junebug85 @MixdMomma  I don't know if its common or not but most women I've known have gone longer with their second with shorter deliveries. I was over a week past my due date with my son. That ended up in a csection, so weve scheduled a csection at 39 weeks for this one. I'm just hoping and praying she hangs in there till then. I'm 31 weeks, and already my stomach seems as big as I was when I delivered my son. I'm afraid she's going to try to come early!!

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  18 Posts B  BabyMcKimmy @melanknnee  First baby was three days early, second was 40w exactly. My labor definitely went quicker the second. Only 8 hours of labor compared to 16. A  AirForcemama84 @melanknnee  I'm curious about this too. My first came at 38 weeks. I don't think this one would come much earlier than that, but I am frustrated trying to make plans for MIL to come out for the delivery. We live on opposite sides of the country, but I would like her to be here to watch DS while I am in the hospital. I wish there was a specific day to tell her to be here! G  GiselaElizabeth @melanknnee  my first was born @ 39w5d, my second was induced at 41w3d. had short labors with both (3 hours, then 2 hours). j  jessika85 My first came right on time, his due date actually lol and our daughter, our second was induced. But labor with our daughter was MUCH shorter than with our son. k  katie0607 @melanknnee  I certainly hope so. My first was 10 days late so I hope this one comes well before that! 5  5thontheway2013 @melanknnee  I had my 1st at 37.5 weeks after 18 hrs labor and over 2 hrs pushing my 2nd was 37 weeks ...16 hrs labor and 45 min pushing my 3rd was 39weeks 1 day and was 24 hrs 38 min in labor and about 15-20 min pushing the only significant difference i noticed with mine was pushing time was pretty much cut in half every time and all my kids came before their due dates so idk if we can go by mine lol h  haribo_02 @melanknnee  my first was 2 weeks earily and my second was 1 week earily. for my first I pushed for 20 min and my second I pushed twice. labor was also shorter for #2, but it was very different: water breaking and being induced twice vs natural labor for #2 K  KissMyJax @5thontheway2013  I have NO memory for specifics but my first was 42 wks, and the next two were rite around 40 wks. The labor with each got shorter & pushing less time. My last came out b4 Dr was even ready! b  blonderubikscube @melanknnee  I'm curious about this, too, but I don't think it really matters (though it's nice to hear labors/pushing are usually shorter!). With my first, my water broke the day after my due date and she was born the next day. I have this "feeling" I won't make it to my due date with #2...but don't really have anything to base it on. I don't normally get "feelings" about things, though, so it's kind of strange (like - I really had no idea on the gender...though DH guessed right both times!). We shall see! K  Kirsty2012 My first was 12 days early and was 2 hours 55 minutes from first contraction to delivery. I'm being induced at 38 weeks with this one so we can ensure 1) that this baby is born in hospital and 2) that we can organize a sitter for dd  D  Dawn422 @melanknnee  I think every baby and pregnancy is different regardless of how many you've had previosly. My first was 5 days early and labored for 9 hours in the hospital. Second was 3 days early and labored for 1-2 hours in hospital. Third was 2 days late and labored for 12 hours in hospital. I am hoping #4 is early and quick, but you never know. H  HypMama76 @melanknnee  #1 was induced at 41 weeks, exactly. I had a 12 hour labor with her, and pushed for about 2.5 hours. #2 was born at home, 42 weeks 3 days. Labor was about 6 hours, and I think I pushed for maybe 30-45 minutes. I am hoping #3 is an easy, quick birth, but you never know. ;) D  DaniBlueEyes @melanknnee  My dr seems to think the second comes earlier and easier. Which is scary cause with my son my water broke at home 8 days before my due date so being a ftm I figured I had alot of time so I took a shower and got ready and took my time. He came alot faster than anyone expected. I only pushed for 20 mins (9lb 3oz baby!! Lol) and the total time from My water breaking til he was born was 7 hours and 15 mins! Everything went so well I just don't see how it'll be easier this time! m  melanknnee Thanks for your input ladies. With my son he came 9 days early, I was in labor for 9 hours and he was out in 2 pushes. I thought it was pretty good considering he was my first child, and I had heard all the stories on how long and hard women labored for with there first child. Iâ€™m still hoping my little girl will arrive a bit early lol. K  Kelzep21 @melanknnee  My first was 6 hours of labor and I delivered her at 37 weeks. My second was 6 hours of labor and I delivered him at 39 weeks! I feel its up to baby when they want to make their appearance!! :) R  RockMeMamma @HypMama76  Am I the only one who is nervous about a SHORT labor? With my first, I knew I had plenty of time to call my SO home to come get me, and get to the hospital, and have the epidural, and then call everyone to let them know it was time. Now with second baby, I am so scared that I will not have enough time to get DH home, and get to the hospital and get the epidural if I need it. I felt like I had more cushion room with the first! Watch, I will be the one who is in labor for 40 hours with the second one, cuz that is just my luck :) M  MommaAnna @melanknnee  i've never heard of baby actually coming EARLIER each time, just that each LABOR is shorter. :S My first was induced at about 42 weeks, and i was in labor for about 24hrs, but only pushed for 30min. I pray to God that this baby comes sooner than that, and labor is shorter! The pushing wasn't too bad though... only pushed about 3 or 4 times. :) Related Articles & Discussions 7 Thoughts Pregnant Moms Have in the Second Trimester | What To Expect  The second trimester often comes with relief because of fewer uncomfortable and unpleasant symptoms and a boost in energy, but it's also when reality sets in about becoming a parent even more.

Odds of going early the second time around? And what about L&D with #2?             newcreation08    Posted 09/23/2009       Hi Ladies,  Just curious if those of you who were early with your first also ended up being early with your second?  My DD  (dear daughter) arrived 8 days early and I'm feeling the same way towards this next little one in regards to going early. Has anyone gone later or overdue with their second when their first was early?  Also, I'm a little apprehensive about getting to the Birth Center in time this time, too. I labored at home with DD  (dear daughter) and didn't end up arriving at the Center until I was already 10cm! (Never thought I had a high pain tolerance, but maybe I do?! My contractions were rather irregular so I didn't realize how far along I really was...)  I've heard second children come much more quickly with a more intense labor. I really don't want to have this next one in the car. :-)  Any suggestions or experiences to share?     --  *Wife to DH, 3/2007* *Mommy to DD 3/2008, DD 11/2009 and a new little one due 5/23/2011*             Comment            Report this post        1          Comments (15)        / 2                   JoAnn3rd    Last edited 09/23/2009      I went about a week and a half early with my ODS, but I had high blood pressure and other issues that I didn't have with our MDS.  With MDS, I thought I had just overdone it, and didn't realize I was in the early stages of labor.  My labor with MDS progressed very quickly, so that coupled with the fact that I have an hour drive to the hospital meant that I arrived and was dialated to 7 and had him in an hour and a half!  He was born the day before his due date, so pretty much right on the money!  I don't think my labor was more intense.  In fact, I thought it went much easier than my first, (and I had an epidural with my first) but I knew what to expect, so that could have made a difference.  I think every time is different, but most people I've talked to had their labors progressively get shorter the more children they had.  I was induced for our YDS, so I don't know if that would be true for me or not, and I am going to be induced for this baby, so I guess I won't get to find out!:)  The only change I've noticed after having three children is that the cramping afterwards when your uterus is getting back down to size was worse with my second, and then worse with my third.  I think its because everything has been stretched out before, so it has more work to do - but its not unbearable or anything!:)  I hope that has helped you out!

I am curious to see how many women had their second baby at an earlier gestational age than the first. I've had 2 OBs and a midwife tell me that typically second babies come sooner and also quicker. I was going to ask on my birth board but then I realized I might offend a bunch of women for telling them that if they were induced for the first birth they need not respond. Lol. But obviously if you were induced you wouldn't really know when the first baby "should" have come.  I went into labor with my daughter at either 37 w 5 d or 37 w 6 d (is it bad I can't remember?) and it started with my water breaking and ended 8.5 hours later with her being born vaginally with no interventions, although I did get an epidural and consent to EFM (because I wasn't educated enough, mostly). Everyone is asking me if I think this baby will be early like my first, "on time" or late.  So... Poll time! And feel free to put details and exact dates in the comments.       --  Haley .

Baby #2 came at 42w exactly, and that labor was 3 hours. Both labors were spontaneous and there was no pitocin or anything used, but for the second I had my membranes swept a couple times like two days before contractions actually got started. I don't think that really started the labor though.  We are wondering if the pattern will hold and give us a one hour labor and a 42+week baby this time.

They told me they'd like me to hit at least 38w this time, but they think I'll get pre-eclampsia again at the same or earlier time.  The worst part is it's another c-section and the hospital won't allow the Dr. to book the operating room any earlier than 4 weeks prior to anyone's due date, and then the c/s has to be scheduled no earlier than someone's 39th week.  So with me, I have to wait until 8/1 to get my c/s date which will be some where between 8/22 and 8/29, but my own Dr. thinks I'll actually be having the baby somewhere around 8/10 if things work out the same way -- and there's no way I can plan for that.  They just seem to unintentionally make us nuts.

So far no signs of anything happening which is great.

So if it helps I am willing to do it.     Were your first two children healthy otherwise for being earlier (esp your first)? My first was 32 weeks, then I had a miscarriage, and this one I'm 19 weeks now and am worried that I will have him really early. My daughter was small but healthy at 32 weeks, so just wondered about earlier babies.  I was supposed to get makena but my doctor doesn't pay for it up front to get reimbursed by my insurance and I can't afford it. So, I probably won't be getting the shot and will have to keep my fingers crossed.    --  ~Ash Lillie Jade born 4/29/10 (2 months early)             Reply            Report this comment       0                  babyilo   Posted 08/17/2014      I had my first at 36weeks,and my second I went 7 days over!!!

Are you having a boy or a girl? Have you picked a name? Did you hear about this great book (or great sleeping pillow or great technique to make your unborn baby smarter)? Above all, though, the question you get asked is: When are you due? The obvious answer is that you’re due on your “due date,” the magic day that your doctor calculated based on a standard 40-week pregnancy. But as it happens, the odds of delivering on your due date are extremely small. Only about 1 in 30 women give birth on their due date. You are more likely to give birth a week early than you are to give birth “on time.”  When do women really give birth?  The most likely birthdate is seven days early, according to a huge sample of birth information put together for the Globe by Brookings Institute researcher and WhenToExpect.com co-creator Matt Chingos.             Advertisement     These figures include not just “spontaneous” deliveries but also planned C-sections and planned inductions. It’s possible that these procedures, which are commonly performed in the week before the actual due date, account for some of the early births. Nevertheless, other researchers who have screened out planned births and looked just at spontaneous births have found a similar pattern , which suggests that babies still like to show up early, even when they’re uncoaxed.

Sign Up      Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here    First children tend to stay put for a little longer. On average, they show up two or three days early. Second and third children arrive five to six days early.            Does it matter if it’s a boy or a girl?   Sex doesn’t seem to matter much. Boys and girls arrive at roughly the same time.            How about younger moms vs. older moms?  The older you are, the more likely you are to give birth early. Teenage moms tend to give birth about three days early, while moms in their 40s trek to the hospital about a week in advance. Part of this is due to birth order, as teenage moms are much more likely to be carrying their first children.            Can these numbers tell me when I’m going to give birth?  Unfortunately, no. At best, they might give you a better sense of the odds and help you win some bets with friends. Still, if there is one clear lesson in the data, it’s this: don’t wait until the last minute. Pack your hospital bag, settle on a name, stock up on sleep, and make sure your friends and family are primed to help. Chances are, your baby is coming sooner than you think.

Read on to find out when your baby will make his appearance. By Lauren Picker from Parents Magazine  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print 7 Must-Know Truths About Due Dates RELATED:  A New Test Can Predict Your Actual Due Date Bet on Unpredictability As a journalist who's accustomed to meeting deadlines, I wasn't surprised when, during my first pregnancy, I went into labor on my due date. The second time around was another matter. My due date came and went. And went, and went, and went. It wasn't until the day before my doctor planned to induce me—at nearly 42 weeks pregnant —that I finally went into labor. My experience brought home one of the essential truths of pregnancy: Your due date is anything but predictable. Still, your doctor needs to determine one that's as accurate as possible so that any necessary tests are done at the correct time. "And knowing how far along you are makes it easier for your obstetrician to see that your baby is growing properly," explains ob-gyn Joanne Stone, M.D., coauthor of Pregnancy for Dummies . RELATED: How You'll Know if You're in Labor Wondering when to expect your new arrival? Find out now. The Dating Game To calculate your due date , your doctor will take the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), and add 280 days (the equivalent of 40 weeks). For example, if your last period started on September 1, your due date would be June 7. This method assumes that your period arrives like clockwork every 28 days. If your cycles are longer, you're likely to deliver later than your due date; if they're shorter, expect to deliver earlier. A first-trimester sonogram is more trustworthy. Your doctor measures the length of the fetus and size of the gestational sac. If these numbers don't match up with what your LMP would predict, she may adjust your due date. But even if your doctor can pinpoint your due date with laserlike precision, don't expect your baby to show up right on schedule. Because, for all the windows into your womb, no one really understands what triggers labor. One possible (but, as my experience shows, imperfect) predictor: your past performance. "Patients tend to repeat what they did in a previous pregnancy," says Iffath Hoskins, M.D., executive director of the Women's Service at the Memorial Health University Medical Center, in Savannah, Georgia. If you're a first-time mom, look at your mother's childbirth history. "If your mother delivered one week past her due date, you are more apt to deliver one week past your due date as well," explains Fredric D. Frigoletto, Jr., M.D., chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Sooner Than Expected Most women—about 80 percent—deliver sometime between 37 and 42 weeks. So where does that leave the other 20 percent? About 11 percent deliver prematurely. Experts aren't sure why some women go into labor early. Possible risk factors include carrying multiples or having an abnormally shaped uterus. There may also be a connection between preterm labor and an infection such as bacterial vaginosis. Even your build can play a role—women who weigh less than 110 pounds are at slightly higher risk. Waiting It Out Once you've passed your due date, you may wonder whether your baby will arrive later than 42 weeks, or post-term. While Caucasian women tend to have slightly longer pregnancies, as do women under 30, no one knows why some babies take their own sweet time. However, your baby's gender could be a clue: One study found that boy fetuses are more likely to go beyond their due date than girls. Beginning at 40 or 41 weeks, expect to undergo weekly, then twice-weekly, nonstress tests. If your pregnancy progresses beyond this point, there's a risk that the quality of the placenta will deteriorate, the amniotic-fluid level will decline, or that your baby will pass a bowel movement, known as meconium. "Babies begin to practice breathing, and they can aspirate the meconium into their lungs—causing postdelivery problems," Dr. Frigoletto says. In addition, because your baby is still growing, you're at higher risk of needing a C-section . For these reasons, your doctor may want to induce labor once you hit 42 weeks. Whether you give birth exactly on your due date—or in the weeks before or after—doesn't really matter in the long run. After all, you'll just be happy to meet your newborn whenever she arrives.

The Odds of Baby Arriving on Their Due Date?           Without a doubt, you’ve heard lots of conflicting information on what a due date actually is.  Most believe the due date is a deadline. If Baby doesn’t arrive on that date, she’s late. If Baby comes before then, she’s automatically “premature.”        Some have theorized that due dates are an invention of modern medicine, and have become an excuse for doctors to perform c-sections. While that’s not what we believe, we do know that due dates are often inaccurate .  Baby should not be expected to arrive on an exact day (unless you’ve scheduled a c-section).  In fact, Baby should not be rushed at all unless there’s a medical reason to do so. According to the March of Dimes , a non-profit that “works to end premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality:”  “Labor should be induced only for medical reasons to protect the health of you and your baby. If your pregnancy is healthy, it’s best to let labor begin on its own without inducing labor.” // MarchofDimes.org  Due Date Statistics  Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants. You can also take the       Due Date Statistics Let’s take a look at the statistics taken from a casual, online survey with 11,704 participants. You can also take the Note: The survey results were not verified. They rely on the honesty and accuracy of online participants. You can also take the survey here at SpaceFem.com.   What is the probability of spontaneous labor after 35 weeks?   Out of 11,1114 women, 8,464 went into labor spontaneously. This equals 76% of the total participants.   What is the probability of giving birth within X days of your due date?   Do babies come on their due dates? Not really, but they usually come sometime around it. Only 4.3% of babies arrived on their due date. Comparatively, 61.6% of non-induced babies arrive within one week of their due date.       What is the average length of pregnancy in weeks?    31.8% of babies were born at 40 weeks  25.7%  were born at 39 weeks  16.1% of babies were born at 41 weeks  13.5% were born at 38 weeks  6.4% were born at 37 weeks  2.8% were born at 36 weeks  2.1 % were born at 42 weeks  1.5% were born at 35 weeks  0.1% were born at 43 weeks.    What is the average length of pregnancy for subsequent births?   If your first baby comes early, will your second baby be early, too? If your second baby arrives late, does that mean your third will come late as well? According to the survey, on average, subsequent babies arrive 0.18 days later than the previous baby.  The average baby #2 came 0.44 days later than baby #1, based on 900 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.73 days earlier than baby #2, based on 187 mothers.  The average baby #3 came 0.58 days earlier than baby #1, based on 184 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.92 days earlier than baby #3, based on 50 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.19 days earlier than baby #2, based on 47 mothers.  The average baby #4 came 0.38 days earlier than baby #1, based on 48 mothers.    What is the length of pregnancy for first-time moms compared to second- and third-time moms?   On average, a first-time mom has her baby at 39 weeks 5 days. This is the equivalent of 54.8% of first-time moms giving birth on or before their due date compared to 56.7% of second-time moms, and 59.5% of third-time mothers.   Is there a connection between length of pregnancy and the type of delivery?    9% of the 8,670 women who went into labor spontaneously underwent a c-section.  19% of 2,343 women who were induced underwent a c-section.  Is there a correlation between induction and increased incidence of cesarean? You decide.   What is the relationship between the length of pregnancy and birth weight?   Are “late” babies huge? On average, “late” babies are generally bigger than “early” ones but not by much. The difference between a baby born at 39 weeks and one born at 41 weeks is about 300 grams.   What is the probability of induction after the due date?   Most doctors will induce a mom rather than let her get past her due date. According to the March of Dimes, however: “If your health care provider talks to you about inducing labor, ask if you can wait until at least 39 weeks to be induced. This gives your baby’s lungs and brain the time they need to fully grow and develop before he’s born.” // MarchofDimes.org   Is there a correlation between the age of the mother and the probability of spontaneous labor?   It has been theorized that the age of the mother has something to do with when labor sets in. Is it possible that the average due date would change depending on ethnicity, age or even country of origin? According to the survey, about the same number of women give birth on day 279 as 287.   Are more babies born on a full moon?   There is no correlation between the phase of the moon and when babies are born.   What is the most common day of the week for babies to be born?   According to the survey, the most common day for babies to be born is Thursday while the least common is Saturday.  Sunday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries and 1.6% induced births.  Monday 11% spontaneous deliveries and 3.2% induced births.  Tuesday 10.7% spontaneous deliveries 4.1% induced births.  Wednesday 10.9% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Thursday 13.1% spontaneous deliveries 4.5% induced births.  Friday 10.6% spontaneous deliveries 3.9% induced births.  Saturday 10% spontaneous deliveries 2.3 % induced births.    What does it mean if I’m 40 weeks pregnant?   Congratulations! You’ve hit your due date and Baby is fully developed! Instead of stressing out that Baby’s not here yet, relax and enjoy the anticipation. 52% of the women surveyed were still pregnant at 40 weeks. 28.79% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 3 days (on or before 40W,3D). It’s normal to still be pregnant at this point. If your doctor or midwife is supportive of natural induction, consider these natural induction methods .  34.49% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 4 days (on or before 40W, 4D)  46.57% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 6 days (on or before 40W, 6D)  57.07% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 8 days (on or before 41W, 1D)  68.61% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 12 days (on or before 41W, 5D)  73.44% of babies were born spontaneously within the next 21 days (on or before 43W, 0D)  26.56% of babies were induced.    I know the exact date I conceived. Can I calculate my exact due date?   Typically, due dates have an 8- to 10-day variation as they are calculated from the last menstrual period, not date of conception. The question then arises, is it possible to calculate an exact due date based on conception date? According to the survey, the standard deviation does not improve even if you know the exact second your baby was conceived. Babies are individuals, just like adults. Some need more time in the womb than others.   Which babies are born earlier, boys or girls?   The average arrival time for babies of both sexes  is 39 weeks and 5 days.   Do inductions bias due date  statistics?   What if all the women who were induced were meant to give birth late? Doesn’t this change the average amount of time a pregnancy should last? Not really, according to the survey. If we assume each induction was actually a late birth, the average median would shift by 2 days.     First Published at www.spacefem.com.

En Español TUESDAY, July 12, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Women who give birth to their first child even a couple of weeks early  are up to three times more likely to deliver their next baby prematurely, new research suggests. "The magnitude of the increased risk surprised us --  it really is a potent factor," said senior study author  Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski. She is associate director of precision health with the University of California, San Francisco's Preterm Birth Initiative. For the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 160,000 women who gave birth in California between 2005 and 2011. The study authors defined "preterm" as birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation and "early term" birth at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant death and a major cause of life-long neurological issues, such as cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing loss, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. First, the researchers took other risk factors for premature birth into account -- such as illegal drug use during pregnancy, high blood pressure, diabetes and urinary tract infections. Still, the researchers found the risk for a subsequent premature delivery was two to three times higher for women who went into early term labor with their first baby. This finding held whether the women went into labor naturally or were induced due to a medical concern, the study found. Based on these findings, more women could be targeted for closer monitoring and treatments that could help reduce the risk for premature delivery during a second pregnancy, the researchers suggested. Of all the first-time deliveries included in the study, almost 6 percent of the women were preterm and would automatically be considered high-risk for another premature delivery. But the researchers noted that 22 percent of the women who delivered between 37 and 38 weeks of pregnancy would not have been labeled as high risk in the future under existing standards of care. "There are so few avenues to lower preterm birth rates, so I'm always thrilled when our work suggests an additional one," Jelliffe-Pawlowski said in a university news release.  The researchers added that women and their doctors should communicate more clearly so that women have a better understanding of prematurity and their risk of delivering early. The study findings were published July 11 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology . More information  The March of Dimes has more about premature babies .

For the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 160,000 women who gave birth in California between 2005 and 2011. The study authors defined "preterm" as birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation and "early term" birth at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant death and a major cause of life-long neurological issues, such as cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing loss, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. First, the researchers took other risk factors for premature birth into account—such as illegal drug use during pregnancy, high blood pressure, diabetes, and urinary tract infections. Still, the researchers found the risk for a subsequent premature delivery was two to three times higher for women who went into early term labor with their first baby. This finding held whether the women went into labor naturally or were induced due to a medical concern, the study found. Based on these findings, more women could be targeted for closer monitoring and treatments that could help reduce the risk for premature delivery during a second pregnancy, the researchers suggested. Of all the first-time deliveries included in the study, almost 6 percent of the women were preterm and would automatically be considered high-risk for another premature delivery. But the researchers noted that 22 percent of the women who delivered between 37 and 38 weeks of pregnancy would not have been labeled as high risk in the future under existing standards of care. "There are so few avenues to lower preterm birth rates, so I'm always thrilled when our work suggests an additional one," Jelliffe-Pawlowski said in a university news release. The researchers added that women and their doctors should communicate more clearly so that women have a better understanding of prematurity and their risk of delivering early. The study findings were published July 11 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology . More information The March of Dimes has more about premature babies .

Started by TheGrouch , Aug 06 2013 08:53 PM            Page 1 of 3    1  2  3    Next     Reply to this topic     61 replies to this topic            #1   TheGrouch    Posted 06 August 2013 - 08:53 PM    A completely self indulgent thread in which I want everyone to say that they went into labour earlier the second time round  My obstetrician tells me that it is uncommon to need to be induced post dates in a second pregnancy, especially if the first labour was spontaneous, so I am clinging on to this information for dear life.  DS was born at 37+5, and I am now 37 weeks with our second baby and freaking out that I could potentially be pregnant for another 4-5 weeks. While 37 is considered at term, I know there may be benefits to the little miss staying in a bit longer. But I have suddenly hit that insomnia/discomfort stage of things where I just want the baby to exit ASAP. Finding this pregnancy much more tiring now that I have a toddler to chase after.  Agh. Maybe I should have posted in venting! Thanks for listening.
