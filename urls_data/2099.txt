Everyone’s DNA is a contribution from both parents, and your parents DNA is a contribution from both grandparents. This means there are tons of combinations that your DNA could be, so its statistically almost impossible to randomly get the same DNA.  The interesting thing is DNA can be used not only to determine IF you’re related to somebody but also HOW your related to them, so a parent/child relationship would have a different amount of DNA in common that Brother/sister or cousin relationships.              0    Gemma Sharp answered on 15 Jun 2011:   No two people who aren’t twins won’t have the same DNA, in fact even twins don’t have the same DNA.  Non-identical twins have about 50% of the same DNA, which makes them no more related than any other siblings.That’s because they come from separate fertilised eggs (so two separate egg cells and two separate sperm cells).  Identical twins come from the same fertilised egg (so one sperm and one egg), but they form in the early stages of development when the fertilised egg is dividing and multiplying. The mass of cells (called a zygote) splits and becomes two masses that develop into two babies. Although identical twins are considered genetically identical, they sometimes look slightly different, and they have different fingerprints.  So that got scientists thinking… If they have the same DNA how come they don’t look exactly alike?  First of all they thought it might be because of environmental things –  even though they both develop in the same womb, maybe they have slightly different experiences that make their fingerprints different? Quite recently though, scientists have found that identical twins don’t actually have the same DNA… Very nearly the same! But not quite… Although they have the same genes (which are sections of DNA), one twin might have more copies of a segment of the gene than the other, and that makes the twins slightly different.

GNN Home       GENOME VARIATIONS       Genome variations are differences in the sequence of DNA from one person 

		to the next. Just as you can look at two people and tell that they are 

		different, you could, with the proper chemicals and laboratory equipment, 

		look at the genomes of two people and tell that they are different, too. 

		In fact, people are unique in large part because their genomes are unique.  How 

          different is one human genome from another?  The more closely related two people are, the more similar their genomes. 

		Scientists estimate that the genomes of non-related peopleany two 

		people plucked at random off the streetdiffer at about 1 in every 

		1,200 to 1,500 DNA bases, or "letters." Whether that's a little or a lot 

		of variation depends on your perspective. There are more than three million 

		differences between your genome and anyone else's. On the other hand, 

		we are all 99.9 percent the same, DNA-wise. (By contrast, we are only 

		about 99 percent the same as our closest relatives, chimpanzees.)  Most genome variations are relatively small and simple, involving only 

          a few basesan A substituted for a T here, a G left out there, 

          a short sequence such as CT added somewhere else, for example. Your 

          genome probably doesn't contain long stretches of DNA that someone else's 

          lacks.  If the genome were a book, every person's book would contain the same 

          paragraphs and chapters, arranged in the same order. Each book would 

          tell more or less the same story. But my book might contain a typo on 

          page 303 that yours lacks, and your book might use a British spelling 

          on page 135"colour"where mine uses the American spelling"color."  If 

          every human genome is different, what does it mean to sequence "the" 

          human genome?  The complete human genome sequence announced in June 2000 is a "representative" 

		genome sequence based on the DNA of just a few individuals. The scientific 

		paper was published in the February 16, 2001 issue of Science . 

		Over the longer term, scientists will study DNA from many different people 

		to identify where and what variations between individual genomes exist. 

		Sequencing a genome is such a Herculean task that capturing its person-to-person 

		variability on the first pass would be next to impossible.  But that doesn't mean that the representative sequence we have now 

          will be uselessfar from it. The vast majority of the genome's 

          sequence is the same from one person to the next, with the same genes 

          in the same places. In other words, my genome is a pretty good approximation 

          of yours, and if scientists sequenced your genome they would learn a 

          lot about mine. Moreover, since every person's genome is unique, no 

          one person is any more or less "representative" than any other and it 

          hardly matters whose genome is sequenced first.       Why 

          is every human genome different?  Every human genome is different because of mutations"mistakes" 

		that occur occasionally in a DNA sequence. When a cell divides in two, 

		it makes a copy of its genome, then parcels out one copy to each of the 

		two new cells. Theoretically, the entire genome sequence is copied exactly, 

		but in practice a wrong base is incorporated into the DNA sequence every 

		once in a while, or a base or two might be left out or added. These mistakes"changes" 

		might be a more accurate word, because they are not always bad newsare 

		called mutations.  When a mutation occurs in a sex cella sperm or an eggit can 

		be passed along to the next generation of people. Your genome contains 

		about 100 "new" mutationschanges that occurred as your parents' 

		bodies made the egg and sperm cells that became you. These genome variations 

		are uniquely yours. Other variations in your genome arose many generations 

		ago and have been passed down from parent to child over the years, until 

		they ended up in you. You probably share each one of these older variations 

		with many other people all over the world, but still, no one else has 

		the exact same combination of variations that you have.  Where 

          are genome variations found?  Variations are found all throughout the genome, on every one of the 

          46 human chromosomes. But this variation is by no means distributed 

          evenly: It's not as if there is one difference every 1,000 bases as 

          regular as rain. Instead, some parts of the genome are "hot spots" of 

          variability, with hundreds of possible variations of a sequence. Other 

          parts of the genome, meanwhile, don't vary much at all between individualsin 

          scientific parlance, they are said to be "stable."  The majority of variations are found outside of genes, in the "extra" 

          or "junk" DNA that does not affect a person's characteristics. Mutations 

          in these parts of the genome are never harmful, so variations can accumulate 

          without causing any problems. Genes, by contrast, tend to be stable 

          because mutations that occur in genes are often harmful to an individual, 

          and thus less likely to be passed on.  What 

          kinds of genome variations are there?  Genome variations include mutations and polymorphisms. Technically, 

          a polymorphism (a term that comes from the Greek words "poly," or "many," 

          and "morphe," or "form") is a DNA variation in which each possible sequence 

          is present in at least 1 percent of people. For example, a place in 

          the genome where 93 percent of people have a T and the remaining 7 percent 

          have an A is a polymorphism. If one of the possible sequences is present 

          in less than 1 percent of people (99.9 percent of people have a G and 

          0.1 percent have a C), then the variation is called a mutation.       Informally, the term mutation is often used to refer to a harmful genome 

          variation that is associated with a specific human disease, while the 

          word polymorphism implies a variation that is neither harmful nor beneficial. 

          However, scientists are now learning that many polymorphisms actually 

          do affect a person's characteristics, though in more complex and sometimes 

          unexpected ways.       About 90 percent of human genome variation comes in the form of single 

          nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced "snips"). As their name 

          implies, these are variations that involve just one nucleotide, or base. 

          Any one of the four DNA bases may be substituted for any otheran 

          A instead of a T, a T instead of a C, a G instead of an A, and so on.  Theoretically, a SNP could have four possible forms, or alleles, since 

          there are four types of bases in DNA. But in reality, most SNPs have 

          only two alleles. For example, if some people have a T at a certain 

          place in their genome while everyone else has a G, that place in the 

          genome is a SNP with a T allele and a G allele.  The human genome contains more than 2 million SNPs.  .  .  .  .

The Claim: Identical Twins Have Identical DNA   By ANAHAD O’CONNOR MARCH 11, 2008     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           THE FACTS It is a basic tenet of human biology, taught in grade schools everywhere: Identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and, thus, share identical genetic profiles. But according to new research, though identical twins share very similar genes, identical they are not. The discovery opens a  new understanding of why two people who hail from the same embryo can differ in phenotype, as biologists refer to a person’s physical manifestation. The new findings appear in the March issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics, in a study conducted by scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and universities in Sweden and the Netherlands. The scientists examined the genes of 10 pairs of monozygotic, or identical, twins, including 9 pairs in which one twin showed signs of dementia or Parkinson’s disease and the other did not. It has long been known that identical twins develop differences that result from environment. And in recent years, it has also been shown that some of their differences can spring from unique changes in what are known as epigenetic factors, the chemical markers that attach to genes and affect how they are expressed — in some cases by slowing or shutting the genes off, and in others by increasing their output.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These epigenetic changes — which accumulate over a lifetime and can arise from things like diet and tobacco smoke — have been implicated in  the development of cancer and behavioral traits like fearfulness and confidence, among other things. Epigenetic markers vary widely from one person to another, but identical twins were still considered genetically identical because epigenetics influence only the expression of a gene and not the underlying sequence of the gene itself.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    “When we started this study, people were expecting that only epigenetics would differ greatly between twins,” said Jan Dumanski, a professor of genetics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an author of the study. “But what we found are changes on the genetic level, the DNA sequence itself.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The specific changes that Dr. Dumanski and his colleagues identified are known as copy number variations, in which a gene exists in multiple copies, or a set of coding letters in DNA is missing. Not known, however, is whether these changes in identical twins occur at the embryonic level, as the twins age or both. “Copy number variations were discovered only a few years ago, but they are immensely important,” said Dr. Carl Bruder, another author of the study at the university. Certain copy variations have been shown in humans to confer protection against diseases like AIDS , while others are believed to contribute to autism , lupus and other conditions. By studying pairs of identical twins in which one sibling has a disease and the other does not, scientists should be able to  identify more easily the genes involved in disease.

This and other research, Dr. Witte said, shows “you’ve got a little bit more genetic variation than previously thought.” In the meantime, a lot of biology textbooks may need updating. Dr. Dumanski pointed out, for example, that as his study was going to press, the following statement could be found on the Web site of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the group that financed the government project to decode the human genome: “Most of any one person’s DNA, some 99.9 percent, is exactly the same as any other person’s DNA. (Identical twins are the exception, with 100 percent similarity).” That, we now know, no longer appears to be the case. THE BOTTOM LINE Identical twins apparently do not have identical DNA.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Claim: Identical twins have identical DNA.

The possibility of having a secret DNA sharing twin is pretty low.       7th April 2011                           Sam Shead                             40% Off When You Subscribe to BBC Focus Magazine!*               The Human Body             Asked by: Griffin Windheuser, by email         Your DNA is arranged into chromosomes, which are grouped into 23 pairs. When a sperm cell is manufactured, the father’s genome is split in two, so that each sperm receives one chromosome from each of the 23 pairs, and the same thing happens with the egg cells in the mother. When the egg and the sperm combine to form an embryo, the resulting genome contains half the mother’s chromosomes and half the father’s, chosen essentially at random.  Theoretically, same-sex siblings could be created with the same selection of chromosomes, but the odds of this happening would be one in 246 or about 70 trillion. In fact, it’s even less likely than that. Before the chromosome pairs fully separate, they often swap individual genes from one chromosome to another in the pair. This means that even if successive sperm were manufactured with exactly the same chromosome selection, they wouldn’t contain the same genes.  Of course, a lot of the gene pairs in your genome are actually the same, so it wouldn’t matter which copy you used, but the odds of constructing an exact duplicate genome by chance are still vanishingly small. And even identical twins don’t necessarily have identical DNA. Stray cosmic rays and chemicals in our diet, such as caffeine and nicotine, can cause point mutations in random genes, here and there.

If it appears on a cartridge shell found at the scene of the crime the next question should be:  is this the home of the person who owns the gun which fired it?  Is this the weapon involved in the crime?  Was the incident a crime?   Thus the fingerprint alone, nor the associated DNA are insufficient evidence.

The Claim: Identical Twins Have Identical DNA   By ANAHAD O’CONNOR MARCH 11, 2008     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           THE FACTS It is a basic tenet of human biology, taught in grade schools everywhere: Identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and, thus, share identical genetic profiles. But according to new research, though identical twins share very similar genes, identical they are not. The discovery opens a  new understanding of why two people who hail from the same embryo can differ in phenotype, as biologists refer to a person’s physical manifestation. The new findings appear in the March issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics, in a study conducted by scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and universities in Sweden and the Netherlands. The scientists examined the genes of 10 pairs of monozygotic, or identical, twins, including 9 pairs in which one twin showed signs of dementia or Parkinson’s disease and the other did not. It has long been known that identical twins develop differences that result from environment. And in recent years, it has also been shown that some of their differences can spring from unique changes in what are known as epigenetic factors, the chemical markers that attach to genes and affect how they are expressed — in some cases by slowing or shutting the genes off, and in others by increasing their output.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These epigenetic changes — which accumulate over a lifetime and can arise from things like diet and tobacco smoke — have been implicated in  the development of cancer and behavioral traits like fearfulness and confidence, among other things. Epigenetic markers vary widely from one person to another, but identical twins were still considered genetically identical because epigenetics influence only the expression of a gene and not the underlying sequence of the gene itself.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    “When we started this study, people were expecting that only epigenetics would differ greatly between twins,” said Jan Dumanski, a professor of genetics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an author of the study. “But what we found are changes on the genetic level, the DNA sequence itself.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The specific changes that Dr. Dumanski and his colleagues identified are known as copy number variations, in which a gene exists in multiple copies, or a set of coding letters in DNA is missing. Not known, however, is whether these changes in identical twins occur at the embryonic level, as the twins age or both. “Copy number variations were discovered only a few years ago, but they are immensely important,” said Dr. Carl Bruder, another author of the study at the university. Certain copy variations have been shown in humans to confer protection against diseases like AIDS , while others are believed to contribute to autism , lupus and other conditions. By studying pairs of identical twins in which one sibling has a disease and the other does not, scientists should be able to  identify more easily the genes involved in disease.

This and other research, Dr. Witte said, shows “you’ve got a little bit more genetic variation than previously thought.” In the meantime, a lot of biology textbooks may need updating. Dr. Dumanski pointed out, for example, that as his study was going to press, the following statement could be found on the Web site of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the group that financed the government project to decode the human genome: “Most of any one person’s DNA, some 99.9 percent, is exactly the same as any other person’s DNA. (Identical twins are the exception, with 100 percent similarity).” That, we now know, no longer appears to be the case.

After all, they derive from just one fertilized egg, which contains one set of genetic instructions, or genome , formed from combining the chromosomes of mother and father.  But experience shows that identical twins are rarely completely the same. Until recently, any differences between twins had largely been attributed to environmental influences (otherwise known as "nurture"), but a recent study contradicts that belief.  Geneticist Carl Bruder of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and his colleagues closely compared the genomes of 19 sets of adult identical twins. In some cases, one twin's DNA differed from the other's at various points on their genomes. At these sites of genetic divergence, one bore a different number of copies of the same gene, a genetic state called copy number variants .  Normally people carry two copies of every gene, one inherited from each parent. "There are, however, regions in the genome that deviate from that two-copy rule, and that's where you have copy number variants," Bruder explains. These regions can carry anywhere from zero to over 14 copies of a gene.  Scientists have long used twins to study the roles of nature and nurture in human genetics and how each affects disease, behavior , and conditions, such as obesity. But Bruder's findings suggest a new way to study the genetic and environmental roots of disease.  For example, one twin in Bruder's study was missing some genes on particular chromosomes that indicated a risk of leukemia , which he indeed suffered. The other twin did not.  Bruder therefore believes that the differences in identical twins can be used to identify specific genetic regions that coincide with specific diseases. Next, he plans to examine blood samples from twin pairs in which only one suffers from asthma or psoriasis to see whether he can find gene copy number changes that relate to either of these illnesses.  The result might also call into question the many findings of previous twin studies that assumed identical twins were indeed identical, Bruder notes. "It's pretty unlikely they're going to significantly change any of the results found so far," counters Kerry Jang, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who runs Canada's largest twin study. "We can adjust our models to take [genetic differences] into account in the same way we've adjusted for different environments."  The discovery of this genetic variation gives hope for an obscure but pressing issue in the case of a criminal suspect who is an identical twin. "If one twin is a suspect and the whereabouts of the other twin cannot be determined, then the jury is often left without the ability to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt" in cases that rely on DNA evidence, says Frederick Bieber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School.  "If the twin issue comes up in a criminal investigation it's possible that if there are [copy number variants] that differ between the two twins that might help sort that out," Bieber says.  Given that there are 80 pairs of identical twins in Virginia's convicted offender database alone, this might not be as small an issue as it may sound. And such genetic variation also matters to the population at large.  Bruder speculates that such variation is a natural occurrence that accumulates with age in everyone. "I believe that the genome that you're born with is not the genome that you die with—at least not for all the cells in your body," he says.  Charles Lee, a geneticist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, agrees. Genetic variations can arise after a double strand of DNA breaks when exposed to ionizing radiation or carcinogens. "It reminds us to be careful about our environment because our environment can help to change our genome," he says.  Plus, these variations may predict age-related diseases . Lee adds: "As you age … your chances for having a genomic rearrangement that causes a certain disease increases all the time."  The differences between identical twins increase as they age, because environmentally triggered changes accumulate. But twins can also begin their lives with differences, according to Bruder's study, and that calls into question their very name.  "Maybe we shouldn't call them identical twins," Harvard's Bieber says. "We should call them 'one-egg twins.'"

                                    ways of convicting criminals.   Many
                                    people are now more informed about the process than they have been in the past, and there is an increasing interest in DNA
                                    evidence.  DNA fingerprinting, which is also referred to as
                                    DNA profiling, includes any of several similar techniques that can analyze and compare DNA from separate sources. This
                                    process is used mainly in law enforcement to identify suspects from hair, blood, semen, or other biological materials found
                                    at the scene of a violent crime.  This process works based on the fact that no two people, with the exception
                                    of identical twins, have exactly the same DNA sequence, much like a personal barcode.  Also, although only limited
                                    segments of a person's DNA are used in the procedure, those segments will always be uniquely different.  DNA fingerprinting
                                    is a highly specific process with very little room for error.  The chances of two people having the same identical
                                    fingerprint is about one in one billion.  This chance of having the same genetic fingerprint can be decreased by using
                                    a larger number of probes in the test.         Click to view larger.    This picture shows a scientist analyzing
                                    a DNA fingerprint.  The fingerprint was processed after completing many steps, which will be discussed further in the

                                    further researched and the procedure has evolved greatly.  There are now many known uses for DNA fingerprinting, many
                                    benefits and limitations to this process, as well as many new advances.

Forensics, DNA Fingerprinting, and CODIS    By: Karen Norrgard, Ph.D. ( Write Science Right ) © 2008 Nature Education  Citation: Norrgard, K. (2008) Forensics, DNA fingerprinting, and CODIS. Nature Education  1( 1 ) :35         How ethical is it to keep a database of convicted felons' DNA profiles? Can we rely on DNA fingerprints for conviction? Many ethical issues surround the use of DNA in forensic technology.                     DNA is present in nearly every cell of our bodies, and we
leave cells behind everywhere we go without even realizing it. Flakes of skin,
drops of blood, hair, and saliva all contain DNA that can be used to identify
us. In fact, the study of forensics , commonly used by police departments and
prosecutors around the world, frequently relies upon these small bits of shed
DNA to link criminals to the crimes they commit. This fascinating science is
often portrayed on popular television shows as a simple, exact, and infallible
method of finding a perpetrator and bringing him or her to justice. In truth, however,
teasing out a DNA fingerprint and determining the likelihood of a match between
a suspect and a crime scene is a complicated process that relies upon probability to a greater extent than most people realize. Government-administered
DNA databases, such as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) , do help speed the
process, but they also bring to light complex ethical issues involving the rights
of victims and suspects alike. Thus, understanding the ways in which DNA evidence
is obtained and analyzed, what this evidence can tell investigators, and how this
evidence is used within the legal system is critical to appreciating the true ethical
and legal impact of forensic genetics.           How Does DNA Identification Work?         Although the overwhelming majority of the human genome is identical across all individuals, there are regions of variation. This variation can occur anywhere in the genome, including areas that are not known to code for proteins. Investigation into these noncoding regions reveals repeated units of DNA that vary in length among individuals. Scientists have found that one particular type of repeat, known as a short tandem repeat (STR) , is relatively easily measured and compared between different individuals. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified 13 core STR loci that are now routinely used in the identification of individuals in the United States, and Interpol has identified 10 standard loci for the United Kingdom and Europe. Nine STR loci have also been identified for Indian populations.  As its name implies, an STR contains repeating units of a short (typically three- to four-nucleotide) DNA sequence. The number of repeats within an STR is referred to as an allele . For instance, the STR known as D7S820, found on chromosome 7, contains between 5 and 16 repeats of GATA. Therefore, there are 12 different alleles possible for the D7S820 STR. An individual with D7S820 alleles 10 and 15, for example, would have inherited a copy of D7S820 with 10 GATA repeats from one parent, and a copy of D7S820 with 15 GATA repeats from his or her other parent. Because there 12 different alleles for this STR, there are therefore 78 different possible genotypes, or pairs of alleles. Specifically, there are 12 homozygotes, in which the same allele is received from each parent, as well as 66 heterozygotes , in which the two alleles are different.         The Statistical Strength of a 13-STR Profile        Within the U.S., the 13-STR profile is a widely used means of identification, and this technology is now routinely employed to identify human remains, to establish or exclude paternity , or to match a suspect to a crime scene sample .  In order to utilize STR information as a means of human identification, the FBI established the frequency with which each allele of each of the 13 core STRs naturally occurs in people of different ethnic backgrounds. To this end, the FBI analyzed DNA samples from hundreds of unrelated Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. Assuming that all 13 STRs follow the principle of independent assortment (and they should, as they are scattered widely across the genome) and that the population randomly mates, a statistical calculation based upon the FBI-determined STR allele frequencies reveals that the probability of two unrelated Caucasians having identical STR profiles, or so-called "DNA fingerprints," is approximately 1 in 575 trillion (Reilly, 2001).  This very small number needs to be put into perspective. Note that this figure refers to pairs of people, and there are many pairs of people in the world. Indeed, for the 100 million Caucasians in the world, there are 5,000 trillion pairs of people, so roughly eight or nine pairs would be expected to match at the 13 STR loci. This predicted matching does not specify which profile is shared by two people, and the chance that anyone matches the particular profile associated with a crime is still very small. The distinction between two people sharing a profile and one person having a particular profile is an example of the so-called "birthday problem." Here, the probability that a person has a particular birthday is 1 in 365, ignoring February 29, but there is a 50% chance that two people in a random group of 23 people have the same unspecified birthday (Weir, 2007).           DNA Extraction and Analysis       To perform a forensic DNA analysis, DNA is first extracted from a sample. Just one nanogram of DNA is usually a sufficient quantity to provide good data. The region containing each STR is then PCR amplified and resolved according to size, giving an overall profile of STR sizes (alleles). The 13 core STRs vary in length from 100 to 300 bases, allowing even partially degraded DNA samples to be successfully analyzed. The costs of analysis, both in time and reagents, are significantly reduced by the amplification of all 13 STRs in just two multiplex PCR reactions.  Depending on the complexity of the repeat unit, the different alleles of an STR can vary by as little as a single nucleotide . For instance, the aforementioned D7S820 STR is relatively simple and contains between 5 and 16 repeats of GATA. Another STR, D21S11, has a more complex repeat pattern consisting of a mixture of tetra- and trinucleotides, and it therefore has alleles that vary in size by a single base pair. Because of the need to differentiate single-base differences, PCR products are typically resolved using automated DNA sequencing technologies with software that recognizes allele patterns by comparison to a known "ladder."           Making an STR Match       In order to match, for example, crime scene evidence to a suspect, a lab would determine the allele profile of the 13 core STRs for both the evidence sample and the suspect's sample. If the STR alleles do not match between the two samples, the individual would be excluded as the source of the crime scene evidence. However, if the two samples have matching alleles at all 13 STRs, a statistical calculation would be made to determine the frequency with which this genotype is observed in the population. Such a probability calculation takes into account the frequency with which each STR allele occurs in the individual's ethnic group. Given the population frequency of each STR allele, a simple Hardy-Weinberg calculation gives the frequency of the observed genotype for each STR. Multiplying together the frequencies of the individual STR genotypes then gives the overall profile frequency.     Table 1: Example DNA Profiles Showing the STR Alleles for Each Sample and the Genotype Frequency of Suspect B for Each STR Locus       STR Locus   Evidence Sample   Suspect A   Suspect B   Suspect B's Genotype Frequency for Each STR   D3S1358  15, 17  17, 17  15, 17  0.13   vWA  15, 16  18, 19  15, 16  0.22   FGA  23, 27  21, 23  23, 27  0.31   D8S1179  12, 13  14, 15  12, 13  0.34   D21S11  28, 30  27, 30.2  28, 30  0.06   D18S51  12, 18  14, 18  12, 18  0.11   D5S818  13, 13  9, 12  13, 13  0.29   D13S317  12, 12  12, 12  12, 12  0.21   D7S820  10, 11  9, 10  10, 11  0.26   CSF1PO  8, 11  11, 12  8, 11  0.18   TPOX  7, 8  8, 8  7, 8  0.30   THO1  9.3, 9.3  6, 9.3  9.3, 9.3  0.38   D16S539  9, 13  11, 12  9, 13  0.10     In the fictional case shown in Table 1, Suspect A is excluded as the source of the crime scene sample. Suspect B, on the other hand, matches the crime scene sample at all 13 STRs. A calculation of the frequency of Suspect B's genotype, based upon the STR allele frequencies within Suspect B's ethnic group, reveals that the likelihood that a random member of this ethnic group has this profile is about 1 in 1.5 billion. It is important to understand that this number is the probability of seeing this DNA profile if the crime scene evidence did not come from the suspect but from some other person. To regard the number as the probability that the suspect is the source of the crime scene evidence is to commit the "prosecutor's fallacy"; this is the logical fallacy of equating "the probability that an animal has four legs if it is an elephant" (high) with "the probability that an animal is an elephant if it has four legs" (low). To go from one probability to another requires the use of Bayes' theorem and some prior (before the DNA profile) probabilities of the suspect being the source of the evidence. In addition, it is important to note that the probability of 1 in 1.5 billion is substantially increased if the actual source is a person related to the suspect, especially a sibling.           Confounding Circumstances of DNA Profiling      Sometimes, the DNA from crime scene evidence is in a very small quantity, poorly preserved, or highly degraded, so only a partial DNA profile can be obtained. When fewer than 13 STR loci are examined, the overall genotype frequency is higher, therefore making the probability of a random match higher as well. For instance, in the fictional case in Table 1, if data were only obtained for the first four STRs listed in Table 1, the likelihood of encountering this genotype would be roughly 1 in 331. In this instance, prosecutors would need additional types of evidence against Suspect B to convince a jury that he or she was the source of the evidence sample. In addition, if an individual happens to have STR alleles that are very common in his or her ethnic group, the genotype frequency can also be quite high, even when all of the core 13 STR loci are examined. It is also important to note that crime scene samples sometimes contain DNA from several different sources. This can make teasing out the sources of the DNA extremely difficult.            Databases of DNA Profiles             DNA evidence is used in court almost routinely to connect
suspects to crime scenes, to exonerate people who were wrongly convicted ,
and to
establish or exclude paternity .
DNA data is considered to be more reliable than many other kinds of crime scene
evidence. For this reason, tissue samples are frequently collected by law
enforcement officials from those individuals who are implicated (even loosely)
in a crime. The unique profile of each DNA sample is analyzed for comparison to
crime scene evidence. The DNA profile can also be stored in a database to
compare with crime scene evidence from past and future crimes.  But under what circumstances should an individual be
compelled to provide a sample for a DNA database? Originally, statutes
mandating collection of tissue for DNA typing applied only to those people convicted
of sex crimes or murder. This was due to the fact that there was usually an
abundance of DNA at the scene of a rape or murder to compare to a suspect's DNA.
More recent DNA collection laws have applied to all convicted felons,
reflecting advances in DNA technologies that allow sufficient DNA samples to be
obtained from scenes of more common crimes, such as burglary (Figure 1). Figure 1: Characteristics of some national DNA databases. © 2004 Elsevier Modified with permission from Niemeyer, D. et al.

Figure Detail         As of July 2008, all 50 states in the U.S. have laws
requiring convicted sex offenders to submit DNA samples, and 46 states have
laws that require other types of convicted felons to do so. Additionally, 11
states require DNA samples from those convicted of certain misdemeanors, and 12
states have laws authorizing DNA sampling from arrestees of certain types of
crime, usually felonies (National
Conference of State Legislatures, n.d.). In comparison, in the United Kingdom,
all arrestees, regardless of the degree of the charge, can be compelled to
provide a sample. In fact, even those who are merely suspects in a crime can be
forced to offer samples (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, n.d.).          Forced DNA Profiling        Those people opposed to DNA banking for law enforcement purposes note
that arrestees are often found innocent of crimes. Retention of an innocent
person's DNA can be seen as an intrusion of personal privacy and a violation of
civil liberties. It is interesting to note that in the United States, under
any other circumstance, the provision of a DNA sample would require informed
consent and other protections for the donor. In contrast, an arrestee's DNA
profile, once entered into a database, can be accessed by police, forensic
scientists, or researchers without the consent of the donor. Another problem
with the DNA database system is an exacerbation of the ethnic bias already
present in the criminal justice system. If people from one ethnic group are
more often arrested, tried, and convicted of felonies, they will be
overrepresented in the database, potentially leading to even more arrests
within that ethnic group.  Proponents of DNA databanks argue that major crimes
often involve people who have also committed other offenses. Having DNA banked
could potentially make it easier to identify suspects. It could also significantly
cut down the cost of an investigation if an automated computer search could
eliminate suspects or link a suspect to a crime scene           Does the DNA Databank System Help Solve Crimes?             The current DNA database maintained by the FBI, known as the
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), contains case samples (DNA samples from
crime scenes or "rape kits") and individuals' samples (collected from convicted
felons or arrestees) that are compared automatically by the system's software
as new samples are entered. As of February 2007, CODIS had produced over 45,400
"hits," which assisted in more than 46,300 investigations (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, n.d.). However, contrary to how DNA analysis is portrayed on
popular television shows, DNA samples are not analyzed within the course of an
hour. Rather, the U.S.
currently has an enormous backlog of samples waiting to be typed and entered
into the database. Some of these samples are from cases that have outlasted
their statutes of limitation, so even if these samples could help solve a
crime, the crime can no longer be tried.  This delay brings up the dilemma of the validity of statutes
of limitation. These statutes were established at a time when large quantities
of physical evidence were required to match a suspect to a sample and when
extended time periods significantly decreased law enforcement's ability to find
a match, as well as the likelihood of successful prosecution. With the advent
of DNA databanks and the possibility of storing samples indefinitely, the very
notion of a statute of limitation now seems extremely outdated.  Of course, there are many other debatable issues concerning
DNA banking. For instance, should the original tissue sample be stored
indefinitely after the DNA profile has been entered into the database?
Detractors note  threats
to genetic privacy , but proponents argue that future DNA
typing methods will undoubtedly be developed and that old samples might have to
be reanalyzed using new techniques. Also at issue is the reopening of old cases
on the basis of new (DNA-based) evidence. Which cases should be eligible for
reanalysis in light of this new evidence? Can equitable rules be established to
allow reexamination of cases that were analyzed with less powerful lab
techniques? Further public awareness of the power of DNA forensic technology
will help lawmakers decide these issues in a way that seeks to strike a balance
between protecting individuals' genetic privacy and protecting innocent citizens
from crime.           Conclusion          DNA evidence is easy to obtain because genetic material is
found in all human cells, save red blood cells. As a result, when we leave
behind small biological bits of ourselves, these bits can be used to identify
us and link us to the places we've been. With modern technology, the amount of
DNA required for analysis can be obtained from even a miniscule biological sample,
which allows police to match crime scene evidence with suspects. However,
because forensics is a science largely rooted in probabilities, even a
confirmed "match" does not supply concrete proof of guilt. In addition, DNA
databases designed to simplify the process of connecting past offenders to
recent crimes are fraught with concerns involving individual genetic rights, as
well as problems related to delayed sample entry, both of which hinder the
ultimate usefulness of these databases. As a result, even though forensics is
undeniably important to the modern justice system, its personal ramifications
and ethical questions are topics of continuing discussion within the
scientific, law enforcement, and legal communities.          References and Recommended Reading    Federal Bureau of Investigation. " CODIS-NDIS Statistics ."

Brenner, Ph.D. 1  A typical DNA case involves the comparison of two samples  an
unknown or evidence sample, such as semen from a rape, and a
known or reference sample, such as a blood sample from a
suspect. If the DNA profile obtained from the two samples are
indistinguishable (they "match"), that of course is evidence for the
court that the samples have a common source  in this case, that the
suspect contributed the semen. How strong is the evidence? If the DNA profile consists of a
combination of traits that figure to be extremely rare, the evidence
is very strong that the suspect is the contributor. To the extent
that the DNA profile is not so rare, it is easier to imagine that the
suspect might be unrelated to the crime and that he matches only by
chance.  DNA profile probability Therefore it is essential to have some idea as to the probability
that a match would occur by chance. It is easiest to illustrate by
example how the probability is determined:   DNA Profile  Allele frequency from database  Genotype frequency for locus   Locus  Alleles  times allele observed  size of database  Frequency  formula  number   CSF1PO  10  109  432  p =  0.25  2 pq  0.16   11 134 q = 0.31  TPOX  8  229  432  p =  0.53  p 2  0.28  8  THO1  6  102  428  p =  0.24  2 pq  0.07  7 64 q = 0.15  vWA  16  91  428  p =  0.21  p 2  0.05  16     profile frequency=  0.00014 The allele 10 at the locus CSF1PO was observed 109 times in a
population sample of 432 alleles (216 people). Therefore it is
reasonable to estimate that there is a chance p =0.25 that
any particular CSF1PO allele, selected at random, would be a 10.
Similarly, the chance is about q =0.31 for a random CSP1PO
allele to be 11. Prior to typing the suspect, if we assume that he is
not the donor of the evidence then we can think of him as someone who
received a CSF1PO allele at random from each of his parents. The
chance to receive 10 from his mother and 11 from his father is
therefore pq , and to receive 11 from mother and 10 from
father is another pq , so the probability to be 10,11 by
chance is 2 pq . Hence about 16% of people have the 10,11
genotype at the CSF1PO locus. At the TPOX locus, since both alleles are the same there is only
one term  pp or p 2 The calculations for the THO1 and vWA loci are similar, and 
taking them into account whittles the overall chance for a random
person to have the combined genotype from 4% down to about 1/7000.  product rule In summary, the probability of a particular multiple-locus genotype
is obtained by multiplication  by multiplying together the
frequencies of the per-locus genotypes, which is to say, by
multiplying together the frequencies of all the individual alleles
and including in addition a factor of 2 for each heterozygous locus.
This way to obtain the frequency of a DNA profile is called the product rule . The profile frequency is sometimes referred to as the random
match probability , or the chance of a random match.  verbal explanation In the example case, the overall profile frequency is 0.00014 or
about 1/7000. Therefore, a summary of the evidence is that either the suspect contributed the evidence, or an unlikely
coincidence happened  the once-in-7000 coincidence that an
unrelated person would by chance have the same DNA profile as that
obtained from the evidence.  A shorter summary is "common source, or unlikely coincidence."  Fallacies   "Prosecutor's fallacy"    correct statement vs. prosecutor's
		fallacy Correct statement  Prosecutor's fallacy  The chance is 1/7000 that some (particular) person other than
			the suspect would leave a stain like the actual stain.  The chance is 1/7000 that someone (anyone) other than the
			suspect left the stain.  are obviously different when shown side-by-side, but there is some
		similarity.  For example, both statments might carelessly be
		paraphrased by the ambiguous statement  The chance is 1/7000 for someone other than the suspect to
		produce the observed evidence. Maybe this is how the "prosecutor's fallacy" got started.  See box prosecutor's fallacy It seems logical therefore that DNA evidence alone cannot be a
proof  some additional information is necessary. However, the
amount of additional information that is necessary might be a very
small amount. For example, add to the DNA matching evidence (of 7000
to one) the mere knowledge that the suspect was arrested before his DNA type was known, and you have something like a
proof.  "Defense attorney's fallacy" Sometime the defense tries to minimize the impact of 7000 to one
matching odds by saying, "Since that means that there are hundreds of
men in this city with the same profile, there is only one chance in
several hundred that my client is the donor of the semen." That would
be good logic if the other evidence suggests that every man in the
city had the same access to the crime scene as did the suspect; not
otherwise.  Laboratory error  Besides "common source", and 
"unlikely coincidence", a third possible explanation for a match between suspect and evidence
is error. The chance of an error that would cause a spurious match 
mishandling the evidence, PCR contamination  although
unquantifiable, is probably very small. Nonetheless, it seems likely
that the chance of error is often much larger than the extremely
small random match chances (such as 1 in 10 8 ) that occur,
so it may be more realistic and more fair in such cases to say "same
source, or (unlikely) error" rather than to say "same source, or
unlikely coincidence."  Microvariants  Sometimes the defense points out that there are sequence
variations in most alleles, so the suspect's allele 10 and the
evidence allele 10, which were reported by the analyst as matching,
may in reality be different. That's true, but irrelevant since the
difference is undetectable to the analysis methods used. The
analysis and statistics are consistent in treating "match" merely to
mean "same category," so the statistical conclusion of "either
common source, or once-in-7000 coincidence" is still
correct.  Limitations  The method of calculation described above makes several
assumptions, and in some cases some of those assumptions may be false
so it is important to be aware of them. There is a more thorough
discussion of all these issues in "The Evaluation of Forensic DNA
Evidence" .  relatives  The analysis above assumes that if suspect is not the donor, he is
unrelated to the donor. But common sense shows immediately that if
the suspect can make a case that a relative of his , especially his brother , is the donor, then
that goes a long way towards explaining away the coincidental
similarity between the suspect and the evidence. The defense always
needs to be aware of this possibility.  There are other computations that can be made to deal with situations where relatives of the suspect (even distant relatives ) 
may be worth considering.  heterogeneous population  The application of the product rule presumes that the relevant 
loci and population be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium . 

These population genetic concepts have been found to hold to a
reasonable degree of accuracy for major populations and typical
forensically used loci. For mixed populations and inbred populations
the product rule is not as accurate. To the extent that the product
rule is inaccurate, the error usually works against suspect, unfairly
exaggerating the strength of the evidence.  Omitted topics  It is beyond the ambition of this section to discuss computations
for DNA identification when the evidence consists of a mixture ( "Interpreting DNA mixtures" ) 

from several people, or how to analyze when the suspect is found
through a database search, or how to analyze relationship cases
including paternity and missing bodies .  1.

Everyone’s DNA is a contribution from both parents, and your parents DNA is a contribution from both grandparents. This means there are tons of combinations that your DNA could be, so its statistically almost impossible to randomly get the same DNA.  The interesting thing is DNA can be used not only to determine IF you’re related to somebody but also HOW your related to them, so a parent/child relationship would have a different amount of DNA in common that Brother/sister or cousin relationships.              0    Gemma Sharp answered on 15 Jun 2011:   No two people who aren’t twins won’t have the same DNA, in fact even twins don’t have the same DNA.  Non-identical twins have about 50% of the same DNA, which makes them no more related than any other siblings.That’s because they come from separate fertilised eggs (so two separate egg cells and two separate sperm cells).  Identical twins come from the same fertilised egg (so one sperm and one egg), but they form in the early stages of development when the fertilised egg is dividing and multiplying. The mass of cells (called a zygote) splits and becomes two masses that develop into two babies. Although identical twins are considered genetically identical, they sometimes look slightly different, and they have different fingerprints.  So that got scientists thinking… If they have the same DNA how come they don’t look exactly alike?  First of all they thought it might be because of environmental things –  even though they both develop in the same womb, maybe they have slightly different experiences that make their fingerprints different? Quite recently though, scientists have found that identical twins don’t actually have the same DNA… Very nearly the same! But not quite… Although they have the same genes (which are sections of DNA), one twin might have more copies of a segment of the gene than the other, and that makes the twins slightly different.

GNN Home       GENOME VARIATIONS       Genome variations are differences in the sequence of DNA from one person 

		to the next. Just as you can look at two people and tell that they are 

		different, you could, with the proper chemicals and laboratory equipment, 

		look at the genomes of two people and tell that they are different, too. 

		In fact, people are unique in large part because their genomes are unique.  How 

          different is one human genome from another?  The more closely related two people are, the more similar their genomes. 

		Scientists estimate that the genomes of non-related peopleany two 

		people plucked at random off the streetdiffer at about 1 in every 

		1,200 to 1,500 DNA bases, or "letters." Whether that's a little or a lot 

		of variation depends on your perspective. There are more than three million 

		differences between your genome and anyone else's. On the other hand, 

		we are all 99.9 percent the same, DNA-wise. (By contrast, we are only 

		about 99 percent the same as our closest relatives, chimpanzees.)  Most genome variations are relatively small and simple, involving only 

          a few basesan A substituted for a T here, a G left out there, 

          a short sequence such as CT added somewhere else, for example. Your 

          genome probably doesn't contain long stretches of DNA that someone else's 

          lacks.  If the genome were a book, every person's book would contain the same 

          paragraphs and chapters, arranged in the same order. Each book would 

          tell more or less the same story. But my book might contain a typo on 

          page 303 that yours lacks, and your book might use a British spelling 

          on page 135"colour"where mine uses the American spelling"color."  If 

          every human genome is different, what does it mean to sequence "the" 

          human genome?  The complete human genome sequence announced in June 2000 is a "representative" 

		genome sequence based on the DNA of just a few individuals. The scientific 

		paper was published in the February 16, 2001 issue of Science . 

		Over the longer term, scientists will study DNA from many different people 

		to identify where and what variations between individual genomes exist. 

		Sequencing a genome is such a Herculean task that capturing its person-to-person 

		variability on the first pass would be next to impossible.  But that doesn't mean that the representative sequence we have now 

          will be uselessfar from it. The vast majority of the genome's 

          sequence is the same from one person to the next, with the same genes 

          in the same places. In other words, my genome is a pretty good approximation 

          of yours, and if scientists sequenced your genome they would learn a 

          lot about mine. Moreover, since every person's genome is unique, no 

          one person is any more or less "representative" than any other and it 

          hardly matters whose genome is sequenced first.       Why 

          is every human genome different?  Every human genome is different because of mutations"mistakes" 

		that occur occasionally in a DNA sequence. When a cell divides in two, 

		it makes a copy of its genome, then parcels out one copy to each of the 

		two new cells. Theoretically, the entire genome sequence is copied exactly, 

		but in practice a wrong base is incorporated into the DNA sequence every 

		once in a while, or a base or two might be left out or added. These mistakes"changes" 

		might be a more accurate word, because they are not always bad newsare 

		called mutations.  When a mutation occurs in a sex cella sperm or an eggit can 

		be passed along to the next generation of people. Your genome contains 

		about 100 "new" mutationschanges that occurred as your parents' 

		bodies made the egg and sperm cells that became you. These genome variations 

		are uniquely yours. Other variations in your genome arose many generations 

		ago and have been passed down from parent to child over the years, until 

		they ended up in you. You probably share each one of these older variations 

		with many other people all over the world, but still, no one else has 

		the exact same combination of variations that you have.  Where 

          are genome variations found?  Variations are found all throughout the genome, on every one of the 

          46 human chromosomes. But this variation is by no means distributed 

          evenly: It's not as if there is one difference every 1,000 bases as 

          regular as rain. Instead, some parts of the genome are "hot spots" of 

          variability, with hundreds of possible variations of a sequence. Other 

          parts of the genome, meanwhile, don't vary much at all between individualsin 

          scientific parlance, they are said to be "stable."  The majority of variations are found outside of genes, in the "extra" 

          or "junk" DNA that does not affect a person's characteristics. Mutations 

          in these parts of the genome are never harmful, so variations can accumulate 

          without causing any problems. Genes, by contrast, tend to be stable 

          because mutations that occur in genes are often harmful to an individual, 

          and thus less likely to be passed on.  What 

          kinds of genome variations are there?  Genome variations include mutations and polymorphisms. Technically, 

          a polymorphism (a term that comes from the Greek words "poly," or "many," 

          and "morphe," or "form") is a DNA variation in which each possible sequence 

          is present in at least 1 percent of people. For example, a place in 

          the genome where 93 percent of people have a T and the remaining 7 percent 

          have an A is a polymorphism. If one of the possible sequences is present 

          in less than 1 percent of people (99.9 percent of people have a G and 

          0.1 percent have a C), then the variation is called a mutation.       Informally, the term mutation is often used to refer to a harmful genome 

          variation that is associated with a specific human disease, while the 

          word polymorphism implies a variation that is neither harmful nor beneficial. 

          However, scientists are now learning that many polymorphisms actually 

          do affect a person's characteristics, though in more complex and sometimes 

          unexpected ways.       About 90 percent of human genome variation comes in the form of single 

          nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced "snips"). As their name 

          implies, these are variations that involve just one nucleotide, or base. 

          Any one of the four DNA bases may be substituted for any otheran 

          A instead of a T, a T instead of a C, a G instead of an A, and so on.  Theoretically, a SNP could have four possible forms, or alleles, since 

          there are four types of bases in DNA. But in reality, most SNPs have 

          only two alleles. For example, if some people have a T at a certain 

          place in their genome while everyone else has a G, that place in the 

          genome is a SNP with a T allele and a G allele.  The human genome contains more than 2 million SNPs.  .  .  .  .

The Claim: Identical Twins Have Identical DNA   By ANAHAD O’CONNOR MARCH 11, 2008     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           THE FACTS It is a basic tenet of human biology, taught in grade schools everywhere: Identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and, thus, share identical genetic profiles. But according to new research, though identical twins share very similar genes, identical they are not. The discovery opens a  new understanding of why two people who hail from the same embryo can differ in phenotype, as biologists refer to a person’s physical manifestation. The new findings appear in the March issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics, in a study conducted by scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and universities in Sweden and the Netherlands. The scientists examined the genes of 10 pairs of monozygotic, or identical, twins, including 9 pairs in which one twin showed signs of dementia or Parkinson’s disease and the other did not. It has long been known that identical twins develop differences that result from environment. And in recent years, it has also been shown that some of their differences can spring from unique changes in what are known as epigenetic factors, the chemical markers that attach to genes and affect how they are expressed — in some cases by slowing or shutting the genes off, and in others by increasing their output.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These epigenetic changes — which accumulate over a lifetime and can arise from things like diet and tobacco smoke — have been implicated in  the development of cancer and behavioral traits like fearfulness and confidence, among other things. Epigenetic markers vary widely from one person to another, but identical twins were still considered genetically identical because epigenetics influence only the expression of a gene and not the underlying sequence of the gene itself.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    “When we started this study, people were expecting that only epigenetics would differ greatly between twins,” said Jan Dumanski, a professor of genetics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an author of the study. “But what we found are changes on the genetic level, the DNA sequence itself.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The specific changes that Dr. Dumanski and his colleagues identified are known as copy number variations, in which a gene exists in multiple copies, or a set of coding letters in DNA is missing. Not known, however, is whether these changes in identical twins occur at the embryonic level, as the twins age or both. “Copy number variations were discovered only a few years ago, but they are immensely important,” said Dr. Carl Bruder, another author of the study at the university. Certain copy variations have been shown in humans to confer protection against diseases like AIDS , while others are believed to contribute to autism , lupus and other conditions. By studying pairs of identical twins in which one sibling has a disease and the other does not, scientists should be able to  identify more easily the genes involved in disease.

This and other research, Dr. Witte said, shows “you’ve got a little bit more genetic variation than previously thought.” In the meantime, a lot of biology textbooks may need updating. Dr. Dumanski pointed out, for example, that as his study was going to press, the following statement could be found on the Web site of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the group that financed the government project to decode the human genome: “Most of any one person’s DNA, some 99.9 percent, is exactly the same as any other person’s DNA. (Identical twins are the exception, with 100 percent similarity).” That, we now know, no longer appears to be the case. THE BOTTOM LINE Identical twins apparently do not have identical DNA.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Claim: Identical twins have identical DNA.

The possibility of having a secret DNA sharing twin is pretty low.       7th April 2011                           Sam Shead                             40% Off When You Subscribe to BBC Focus Magazine!*               The Human Body             Asked by: Griffin Windheuser, by email         Your DNA is arranged into chromosomes, which are grouped into 23 pairs. When a sperm cell is manufactured, the father’s genome is split in two, so that each sperm receives one chromosome from each of the 23 pairs, and the same thing happens with the egg cells in the mother. When the egg and the sperm combine to form an embryo, the resulting genome contains half the mother’s chromosomes and half the father’s, chosen essentially at random.  Theoretically, same-sex siblings could be created with the same selection of chromosomes, but the odds of this happening would be one in 246 or about 70 trillion. In fact, it’s even less likely than that. Before the chromosome pairs fully separate, they often swap individual genes from one chromosome to another in the pair. This means that even if successive sperm were manufactured with exactly the same chromosome selection, they wouldn’t contain the same genes.  Of course, a lot of the gene pairs in your genome are actually the same, so it wouldn’t matter which copy you used, but the odds of constructing an exact duplicate genome by chance are still vanishingly small. And even identical twins don’t necessarily have identical DNA. Stray cosmic rays and chemicals in our diet, such as caffeine and nicotine, can cause point mutations in random genes, here and there.

Besides, identity requires 13 matches, not 9.  So this article appears to be a defense lawyer type attack on the general validity of DNA profiling.  The actual weaknesses are in the areas of contamination (see Wikipedia article again), and circumstances.  There are many reasons why DNA may be present ... good police work will provide more evidence such as means, motive, and opportunity - without these any case is weak.  The long history of fingerprint identification has similar issues:  how did the fingerprint get there?  If it appears on a cartridge shell found at the scene of the crime the next question should be:  is this the home of the person who owns the gun which fired it?  Is this the weapon involved in the crime?  Was the incident a crime?   Thus the fingerprint alone, nor the associated DNA are insufficient evidence.

The Claim: Identical Twins Have Identical DNA   By ANAHAD O’CONNOR MARCH 11, 2008     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           THE FACTS It is a basic tenet of human biology, taught in grade schools everywhere: Identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and, thus, share identical genetic profiles. But according to new research, though identical twins share very similar genes, identical they are not. The discovery opens a  new understanding of why two people who hail from the same embryo can differ in phenotype, as biologists refer to a person’s physical manifestation. The new findings appear in the March issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics, in a study conducted by scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and universities in Sweden and the Netherlands. The scientists examined the genes of 10 pairs of monozygotic, or identical, twins, including 9 pairs in which one twin showed signs of dementia or Parkinson’s disease and the other did not. It has long been known that identical twins develop differences that result from environment. And in recent years, it has also been shown that some of their differences can spring from unique changes in what are known as epigenetic factors, the chemical markers that attach to genes and affect how they are expressed — in some cases by slowing or shutting the genes off, and in others by increasing their output.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These epigenetic changes — which accumulate over a lifetime and can arise from things like diet and tobacco smoke — have been implicated in  the development of cancer and behavioral traits like fearfulness and confidence, among other things. Epigenetic markers vary widely from one person to another, but identical twins were still considered genetically identical because epigenetics influence only the expression of a gene and not the underlying sequence of the gene itself.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    “When we started this study, people were expecting that only epigenetics would differ greatly between twins,” said Jan Dumanski, a professor of genetics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an author of the study. “But what we found are changes on the genetic level, the DNA sequence itself.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The specific changes that Dr. Dumanski and his colleagues identified are known as copy number variations, in which a gene exists in multiple copies, or a set of coding letters in DNA is missing. Not known, however, is whether these changes in identical twins occur at the embryonic level, as the twins age or both. “Copy number variations were discovered only a few years ago, but they are immensely important,” said Dr. Carl Bruder, another author of the study at the university. Certain copy variations have been shown in humans to confer protection against diseases like AIDS , while others are believed to contribute to autism , lupus and other conditions. By studying pairs of identical twins in which one sibling has a disease and the other does not, scientists should be able to  identify more easily the genes involved in disease.

This and other research, Dr. Witte said, shows “you’ve got a little bit more genetic variation than previously thought.” In the meantime, a lot of biology textbooks may need updating. Dr. Dumanski pointed out, for example, that as his study was going to press, the following statement could be found on the Web site of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the group that financed the government project to decode the human genome: “Most of any one person’s DNA, some 99.9 percent, is exactly the same as any other person’s DNA. (Identical twins are the exception, with 100 percent similarity).” That, we now know, no longer appears to be the case.

After all, they derive from just one fertilized egg, which contains one set of genetic instructions, or genome , formed from combining the chromosomes of mother and father.  But experience shows that identical twins are rarely completely the same. Until recently, any differences between twins had largely been attributed to environmental influences (otherwise known as "nurture"), but a recent study contradicts that belief.  Geneticist Carl Bruder of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and his colleagues closely compared the genomes of 19 sets of adult identical twins. In some cases, one twin's DNA differed from the other's at various points on their genomes. At these sites of genetic divergence, one bore a different number of copies of the same gene, a genetic state called copy number variants .  Normally people carry two copies of every gene, one inherited from each parent. "There are, however, regions in the genome that deviate from that two-copy rule, and that's where you have copy number variants," Bruder explains. These regions can carry anywhere from zero to over 14 copies of a gene.  Scientists have long used twins to study the roles of nature and nurture in human genetics and how each affects disease, behavior , and conditions, such as obesity. But Bruder's findings suggest a new way to study the genetic and environmental roots of disease.  For example, one twin in Bruder's study was missing some genes on particular chromosomes that indicated a risk of leukemia , which he indeed suffered. The other twin did not.  Bruder therefore believes that the differences in identical twins can be used to identify specific genetic regions that coincide with specific diseases. Next, he plans to examine blood samples from twin pairs in which only one suffers from asthma or psoriasis to see whether he can find gene copy number changes that relate to either of these illnesses.  The result might also call into question the many findings of previous twin studies that assumed identical twins were indeed identical, Bruder notes. "It's pretty unlikely they're going to significantly change any of the results found so far," counters Kerry Jang, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who runs Canada's largest twin study. "We can adjust our models to take [genetic differences] into account in the same way we've adjusted for different environments."  The discovery of this genetic variation gives hope for an obscure but pressing issue in the case of a criminal suspect who is an identical twin. "If one twin is a suspect and the whereabouts of the other twin cannot be determined, then the jury is often left without the ability to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt" in cases that rely on DNA evidence, says Frederick Bieber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School.  "If the twin issue comes up in a criminal investigation it's possible that if there are [copy number variants] that differ between the two twins that might help sort that out," Bieber says.  Given that there are 80 pairs of identical twins in Virginia's convicted offender database alone, this might not be as small an issue as it may sound. And such genetic variation also matters to the population at large.  Bruder speculates that such variation is a natural occurrence that accumulates with age in everyone. "I believe that the genome that you're born with is not the genome that you die with—at least not for all the cells in your body," he says.  Charles Lee, a geneticist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, agrees. Genetic variations can arise after a double strand of DNA breaks when exposed to ionizing radiation or carcinogens. "It reminds us to be careful about our environment because our environment can help to change our genome," he says.  Plus, these variations may predict age-related diseases . Lee adds: "As you age … your chances for having a genomic rearrangement that causes a certain disease increases all the time."  The differences between identical twins increase as they age, because environmentally triggered changes accumulate. But twins can also begin their lives with differences, according to Bruder's study, and that calls into question their very name.  "Maybe we shouldn't call them identical twins," Harvard's Bieber says. "We should call them 'one-egg twins.'"

                                    ways of convicting criminals.   Many
                                    people are now more informed about the process than they have been in the past, and there is an increasing interest in DNA
                                    evidence.  DNA fingerprinting, which is also referred to as
                                    DNA profiling, includes any of several similar techniques that can analyze and compare DNA from separate sources. This
                                    process is used mainly in law enforcement to identify suspects from hair, blood, semen, or other biological materials found
                                    at the scene of a violent crime.  This process works based on the fact that no two people, with the exception
                                    of identical twins, have exactly the same DNA sequence, much like a personal barcode.  Also, although only limited
                                    segments of a person's DNA are used in the procedure, those segments will always be uniquely different.  DNA fingerprinting
                                    is a highly specific process with very little room for error.  The chances of two people having the same identical
                                    fingerprint is about one in one billion.  This chance of having the same genetic fingerprint can be decreased by using
                                    a larger number of probes in the test.         Click to view larger.    This picture shows a scientist analyzing

                                    further researched and the procedure has evolved greatly.  There are now many known uses for DNA fingerprinting, many

Forensics, DNA Fingerprinting, and CODIS    By: Karen Norrgard, Ph.D. ( Write Science Right ) © 2008 Nature Education  Citation: Norrgard, K. (2008) Forensics, DNA fingerprinting, and CODIS. Nature Education  1( 1 ) :35         How ethical is it to keep a database of convicted felons' DNA profiles? Can we rely on DNA fingerprints for conviction? Many ethical issues surround the use of DNA in forensic technology.                     DNA is present in nearly every cell of our bodies, and we
leave cells behind everywhere we go without even realizing it. Flakes of skin,
drops of blood, hair, and saliva all contain DNA that can be used to identify
us. In fact, the study of forensics , commonly used by police departments and
prosecutors around the world, frequently relies upon these small bits of shed
DNA to link criminals to the crimes they commit. This fascinating science is
often portrayed on popular television shows as a simple, exact, and infallible
method of finding a perpetrator and bringing him or her to justice. In truth, however,
teasing out a DNA fingerprint and determining the likelihood of a match between
a suspect and a crime scene is a complicated process that relies upon probability to a greater extent than most people realize. Government-administered
DNA databases, such as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) , do help speed the
process, but they also bring to light complex ethical issues involving the rights
of victims and suspects alike. Thus, understanding the ways in which DNA evidence
is obtained and analyzed, what this evidence can tell investigators, and how this
evidence is used within the legal system is critical to appreciating the true ethical
and legal impact of forensic genetics.           How Does DNA Identification Work?         Although the overwhelming majority of the human genome is identical across all individuals, there are regions of variation. This variation can occur anywhere in the genome, including areas that are not known to code for proteins. Investigation into these noncoding regions reveals repeated units of DNA that vary in length among individuals. Scientists have found that one particular type of repeat, known as a short tandem repeat (STR) , is relatively easily measured and compared between different individuals. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified 13 core STR loci that are now routinely used in the identification of individuals in the United States, and Interpol has identified 10 standard loci for the United Kingdom and Europe. Nine STR loci have also been identified for Indian populations.  As its name implies, an STR contains repeating units of a short (typically three- to four-nucleotide) DNA sequence. The number of repeats within an STR is referred to as an allele . For instance, the STR known as D7S820, found on chromosome 7, contains between 5 and 16 repeats of GATA. Therefore, there are 12 different alleles possible for the D7S820 STR. An individual with D7S820 alleles 10 and 15, for example, would have inherited a copy of D7S820 with 10 GATA repeats from one parent, and a copy of D7S820 with 15 GATA repeats from his or her other parent. Because there 12 different alleles for this STR, there are therefore 78 different possible genotypes, or pairs of alleles. Specifically, there are 12 homozygotes, in which the same allele is received from each parent, as well as 66 heterozygotes , in which the two alleles are different.         The Statistical Strength of a 13-STR Profile        Within the U.S., the 13-STR profile is a widely used means of identification, and this technology is now routinely employed to identify human remains, to establish or exclude paternity , or to match a suspect to a crime scene sample .  In order to utilize STR information as a means of human identification, the FBI established the frequency with which each allele of each of the 13 core STRs naturally occurs in people of different ethnic backgrounds. To this end, the FBI analyzed DNA samples from hundreds of unrelated Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. Assuming that all 13 STRs follow the principle of independent assortment (and they should, as they are scattered widely across the genome) and that the population randomly mates, a statistical calculation based upon the FBI-determined STR allele frequencies reveals that the probability of two unrelated Caucasians having identical STR profiles, or so-called "DNA fingerprints," is approximately 1 in 575 trillion (Reilly, 2001).  This very small number needs to be put into perspective. Note that this figure refers to pairs of people, and there are many pairs of people in the world. Indeed, for the 100 million Caucasians in the world, there are 5,000 trillion pairs of people, so roughly eight or nine pairs would be expected to match at the 13 STR loci. This predicted matching does not specify which profile is shared by two people, and the chance that anyone matches the particular profile associated with a crime is still very small. The distinction between two people sharing a profile and one person having a particular profile is an example of the so-called "birthday problem." Here, the probability that a person has a particular birthday is 1 in 365, ignoring February 29, but there is a 50% chance that two people in a random group of 23 people have the same unspecified birthday (Weir, 2007).           DNA Extraction and Analysis       To perform a forensic DNA analysis, DNA is first extracted from a sample. Just one nanogram of DNA is usually a sufficient quantity to provide good data. The region containing each STR is then PCR amplified and resolved according to size, giving an overall profile of STR sizes (alleles). The 13 core STRs vary in length from 100 to 300 bases, allowing even partially degraded DNA samples to be successfully analyzed. The costs of analysis, both in time and reagents, are significantly reduced by the amplification of all 13 STRs in just two multiplex PCR reactions.  Depending on the complexity of the repeat unit, the different alleles of an STR can vary by as little as a single nucleotide . For instance, the aforementioned D7S820 STR is relatively simple and contains between 5 and 16 repeats of GATA. Another STR, D21S11, has a more complex repeat pattern consisting of a mixture of tetra- and trinucleotides, and it therefore has alleles that vary in size by a single base pair. Because of the need to differentiate single-base differences, PCR products are typically resolved using automated DNA sequencing technologies with software that recognizes allele patterns by comparison to a known "ladder."           Making an STR Match       In order to match, for example, crime scene evidence to a suspect, a lab would determine the allele profile of the 13 core STRs for both the evidence sample and the suspect's sample. If the STR alleles do not match between the two samples, the individual would be excluded as the source of the crime scene evidence. However, if the two samples have matching alleles at all 13 STRs, a statistical calculation would be made to determine the frequency with which this genotype is observed in the population. Such a probability calculation takes into account the frequency with which each STR allele occurs in the individual's ethnic group. Given the population frequency of each STR allele, a simple Hardy-Weinberg calculation gives the frequency of the observed genotype for each STR. Multiplying together the frequencies of the individual STR genotypes then gives the overall profile frequency.     Table 1: Example DNA Profiles Showing the STR Alleles for Each Sample and the Genotype Frequency of Suspect B for Each STR Locus       STR Locus   Evidence Sample   Suspect A   Suspect B   Suspect B's Genotype Frequency for Each STR   D3S1358  15, 17  17, 17  15, 17  0.13   vWA  15, 16  18, 19  15, 16  0.22   FGA  23, 27  21, 23  23, 27  0.31   D8S1179  12, 13  14, 15  12, 13  0.34   D21S11  28, 30  27, 30.2  28, 30  0.06   D18S51  12, 18  14, 18  12, 18  0.11   D5S818  13, 13  9, 12  13, 13  0.29   D13S317  12, 12  12, 12  12, 12  0.21   D7S820  10, 11  9, 10  10, 11  0.26   CSF1PO  8, 11  11, 12  8, 11  0.18   TPOX  7, 8  8, 8  7, 8  0.30   THO1  9.3, 9.3  6, 9.3  9.3, 9.3  0.38   D16S539  9, 13  11, 12  9, 13  0.10     In the fictional case shown in Table 1, Suspect A is excluded as the source of the crime scene sample. Suspect B, on the other hand, matches the crime scene sample at all 13 STRs. A calculation of the frequency of Suspect B's genotype, based upon the STR allele frequencies within Suspect B's ethnic group, reveals that the likelihood that a random member of this ethnic group has this profile is about 1 in 1.5 billion. It is important to understand that this number is the probability of seeing this DNA profile if the crime scene evidence did not come from the suspect but from some other person. To regard the number as the probability that the suspect is the source of the crime scene evidence is to commit the "prosecutor's fallacy"; this is the logical fallacy of equating "the probability that an animal has four legs if it is an elephant" (high) with "the probability that an animal is an elephant if it has four legs" (low). To go from one probability to another requires the use of Bayes' theorem and some prior (before the DNA profile) probabilities of the suspect being the source of the evidence. In addition, it is important to note that the probability of 1 in 1.5 billion is substantially increased if the actual source is a person related to the suspect, especially a sibling.           Confounding Circumstances of DNA Profiling      Sometimes, the DNA from crime scene evidence is in a very small quantity, poorly preserved, or highly degraded, so only a partial DNA profile can be obtained. When fewer than 13 STR loci are examined, the overall genotype frequency is higher, therefore making the probability of a random match higher as well. For instance, in the fictional case in Table 1, if data were only obtained for the first four STRs listed in Table 1, the likelihood of encountering this genotype would be roughly 1 in 331. In this instance, prosecutors would need additional types of evidence against Suspect B to convince a jury that he or she was the source of the evidence sample. In addition, if an individual happens to have STR alleles that are very common in his or her ethnic group, the genotype frequency can also be quite high, even when all of the core 13 STR loci are examined. It is also important to note that crime scene samples sometimes contain DNA from several different sources. This can make teasing out the sources of the DNA extremely difficult.            Databases of DNA Profiles             DNA evidence is used in court almost routinely to connect
suspects to crime scenes, to exonerate people who were wrongly convicted ,
and to
establish or exclude paternity .
DNA data is considered to be more reliable than many other kinds of crime scene
evidence. For this reason, tissue samples are frequently collected by law
enforcement officials from those individuals who are implicated (even loosely)
in a crime. The unique profile of each DNA sample is analyzed for comparison to
crime scene evidence. The DNA profile can also be stored in a database to
compare with crime scene evidence from past and future crimes.  But under what circumstances should an individual be
compelled to provide a sample for a DNA database? Originally, statutes
mandating collection of tissue for DNA typing applied only to those people convicted
of sex crimes or murder. This was due to the fact that there was usually an
abundance of DNA at the scene of a rape or murder to compare to a suspect's DNA.
More recent DNA collection laws have applied to all convicted felons,
reflecting advances in DNA technologies that allow sufficient DNA samples to be
obtained from scenes of more common crimes, such as burglary (Figure 1). Figure 1: Characteristics of some national DNA databases. © 2004 Elsevier Modified with permission from Niemeyer, D. et al.

Figure Detail         As of July 2008, all 50 states in the U.S. have laws
requiring convicted sex offenders to submit DNA samples, and 46 states have
laws that require other types of convicted felons to do so. Additionally, 11
states require DNA samples from those convicted of certain misdemeanors, and 12
states have laws authorizing DNA sampling from arrestees of certain types of
crime, usually felonies (National
Conference of State Legislatures, n.d.). In comparison, in the United Kingdom,
all arrestees, regardless of the degree of the charge, can be compelled to
provide a sample. In fact, even those who are merely suspects in a crime can be
forced to offer samples (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, n.d.).          Forced DNA Profiling        Those people opposed to DNA banking for law enforcement purposes note
that arrestees are often found innocent of crimes. Retention of an innocent
person's DNA can be seen as an intrusion of personal privacy and a violation of
civil liberties. It is interesting to note that in the United States, under
any other circumstance, the provision of a DNA sample would require informed
consent and other protections for the donor. In contrast, an arrestee's DNA
profile, once entered into a database, can be accessed by police, forensic
scientists, or researchers without the consent of the donor. Another problem
with the DNA database system is an exacerbation of the ethnic bias already
present in the criminal justice system. If people from one ethnic group are
more often arrested, tried, and convicted of felonies, they will be
overrepresented in the database, potentially leading to even more arrests
within that ethnic group.  Proponents of DNA databanks argue that major crimes
often involve people who have also committed other offenses. Having DNA banked
could potentially make it easier to identify suspects. It could also significantly
cut down the cost of an investigation if an automated computer search could
eliminate suspects or link a suspect to a crime scene           Does the DNA Databank System Help Solve Crimes?             The current DNA database maintained by the FBI, known as the
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), contains case samples (DNA samples from
crime scenes or "rape kits") and individuals' samples (collected from convicted
felons or arrestees) that are compared automatically by the system's software
as new samples are entered. As of February 2007, CODIS had produced over 45,400
"hits," which assisted in more than 46,300 investigations (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, n.d.). However, contrary to how DNA analysis is portrayed on
popular television shows, DNA samples are not analyzed within the course of an
hour. Rather, the U.S.
currently has an enormous backlog of samples waiting to be typed and entered
into the database. Some of these samples are from cases that have outlasted
their statutes of limitation, so even if these samples could help solve a
crime, the crime can no longer be tried.  This delay brings up the dilemma of the validity of statutes
of limitation. These statutes were established at a time when large quantities
of physical evidence were required to match a suspect to a sample and when
extended time periods significantly decreased law enforcement's ability to find
a match, as well as the likelihood of successful prosecution. With the advent
of DNA databanks and the possibility of storing samples indefinitely, the very
notion of a statute of limitation now seems extremely outdated.  Of course, there are many other debatable issues concerning
DNA banking. For instance, should the original tissue sample be stored
indefinitely after the DNA profile has been entered into the database?
Detractors note  threats
to genetic privacy , but proponents argue that future DNA
typing methods will undoubtedly be developed and that old samples might have to
be reanalyzed using new techniques. Also at issue is the reopening of old cases
on the basis of new (DNA-based) evidence. Which cases should be eligible for
reanalysis in light of this new evidence? Can equitable rules be established to
allow reexamination of cases that were analyzed with less powerful lab
techniques? Further public awareness of the power of DNA forensic technology
will help lawmakers decide these issues in a way that seeks to strike a balance
between protecting individuals' genetic privacy and protecting innocent citizens
from crime.           Conclusion          DNA evidence is easy to obtain because genetic material is
found in all human cells, save red blood cells. As a result, when we leave
behind small biological bits of ourselves, these bits can be used to identify
us and link us to the places we've been. With modern technology, the amount of
DNA required for analysis can be obtained from even a miniscule biological sample,
which allows police to match crime scene evidence with suspects. However,
because forensics is a science largely rooted in probabilities, even a
confirmed "match" does not supply concrete proof of guilt. In addition, DNA
databases designed to simplify the process of connecting past offenders to
recent crimes are fraught with concerns involving individual genetic rights, as
well as problems related to delayed sample entry, both of which hinder the
ultimate usefulness of these databases. As a result, even though forensics is
undeniably important to the modern justice system, its personal ramifications
and ethical questions are topics of continuing discussion within the
scientific, law enforcement, and legal communities.          References and Recommended Reading    Federal Bureau of Investigation. " CODIS-NDIS Statistics ."

Brenner, Ph.D. 1  A typical DNA case involves the comparison of two samples  an
unknown or evidence sample, such as semen from a rape, and a
known or reference sample, such as a blood sample from a
suspect. If the DNA profile obtained from the two samples are
indistinguishable (they "match"), that of course is evidence for the
court that the samples have a common source  in this case, that the
suspect contributed the semen. How strong is the evidence? If the DNA profile consists of a
combination of traits that figure to be extremely rare, the evidence
is very strong that the suspect is the contributor. To the extent
that the DNA profile is not so rare, it is easier to imagine that the
suspect might be unrelated to the crime and that he matches only by
chance.  DNA profile probability Therefore it is essential to have some idea as to the probability
that a match would occur by chance. It is easiest to illustrate by
example how the probability is determined:   DNA Profile  Allele frequency from database  Genotype frequency for locus   Locus  Alleles  times allele observed  size of database  Frequency  formula  number   CSF1PO  10  109  432  p =  0.25  2 pq  0.16   11 134 q = 0.31  TPOX  8  229  432  p =  0.53  p 2  0.28  8  THO1  6  102  428  p =  0.24  2 pq  0.07  7 64 q = 0.15  vWA  16  91  428  p =  0.21  p 2  0.05  16     profile frequency=  0.00014 The allele 10 at the locus CSF1PO was observed 109 times in a
population sample of 432 alleles (216 people). Therefore it is
reasonable to estimate that there is a chance p =0.25 that
any particular CSF1PO allele, selected at random, would be a 10.
Similarly, the chance is about q =0.31 for a random CSP1PO
allele to be 11. Prior to typing the suspect, if we assume that he is
not the donor of the evidence then we can think of him as someone who
received a CSF1PO allele at random from each of his parents. The
chance to receive 10 from his mother and 11 from his father is
therefore pq , and to receive 11 from mother and 10 from
father is another pq , so the probability to be 10,11 by
chance is 2 pq . Hence about 16% of people have the 10,11
genotype at the CSF1PO locus. At the TPOX locus, since both alleles are the same there is only
one term  pp or p 2 The calculations for the THO1 and vWA loci are similar, and 
taking them into account whittles the overall chance for a random
person to have the combined genotype from 4% down to about 1/7000.  product rule In summary, the probability of a particular multiple-locus genotype
is obtained by multiplication  by multiplying together the
frequencies of the per-locus genotypes, which is to say, by
multiplying together the frequencies of all the individual alleles
and including in addition a factor of 2 for each heterozygous locus.
This way to obtain the frequency of a DNA profile is called the product rule . The profile frequency is sometimes referred to as the random
match probability , or the chance of a random match.  verbal explanation In the example case, the overall profile frequency is 0.00014 or
about 1/7000. Therefore, a summary of the evidence is that either the suspect contributed the evidence, or an unlikely
coincidence happened  the once-in-7000 coincidence that an
unrelated person would by chance have the same DNA profile as that
obtained from the evidence.  A shorter summary is "common source, or unlikely coincidence."  Fallacies   "Prosecutor's fallacy"    correct statement vs. prosecutor's
		fallacy Correct statement  Prosecutor's fallacy  The chance is 1/7000 that some (particular) person other than
			the suspect would leave a stain like the actual stain.  The chance is 1/7000 that someone (anyone) other than the
			suspect left the stain.  are obviously different when shown side-by-side, but there is some
		similarity.  For example, both statments might carelessly be
		paraphrased by the ambiguous statement  The chance is 1/7000 for someone other than the suspect to
		produce the observed evidence. Maybe this is how the "prosecutor's fallacy" got started.  See box prosecutor's fallacy It seems logical therefore that DNA evidence alone cannot be a
proof  some additional information is necessary. However, the
amount of additional information that is necessary might be a very
small amount. For example, add to the DNA matching evidence (of 7000
to one) the mere knowledge that the suspect was arrested before his DNA type was known, and you have something like a
proof.  "Defense attorney's fallacy" Sometime the defense tries to minimize the impact of 7000 to one
matching odds by saying, "Since that means that there are hundreds of
men in this city with the same profile, there is only one chance in
several hundred that my client is the donor of the semen." That would
be good logic if the other evidence suggests that every man in the
city had the same access to the crime scene as did the suspect; not
otherwise.  Laboratory error  Besides "common source", and 
"unlikely coincidence", a third possible explanation for a match between suspect and evidence
is error. The chance of an error that would cause a spurious match 
mishandling the evidence, PCR contamination  although
unquantifiable, is probably very small. Nonetheless, it seems likely
that the chance of error is often much larger than the extremely
small random match chances (such as 1 in 10 8 ) that occur,
so it may be more realistic and more fair in such cases to say "same
source, or (unlikely) error" rather than to say "same source, or
unlikely coincidence."  Microvariants  Sometimes the defense points out that there are sequence
variations in most alleles, so the suspect's allele 10 and the
evidence allele 10, which were reported by the analyst as matching,
may in reality be different. That's true, but irrelevant since the
difference is undetectable to the analysis methods used. The
analysis and statistics are consistent in treating "match" merely to
mean "same category," so the statistical conclusion of "either
common source, or once-in-7000 coincidence" is still
correct.  Limitations  The method of calculation described above makes several
assumptions, and in some cases some of those assumptions may be false
so it is important to be aware of them. There is a more thorough
discussion of all these issues in "The Evaluation of Forensic DNA
Evidence" .  relatives  The analysis above assumes that if suspect is not the donor, he is
unrelated to the donor. But common sense shows immediately that if
the suspect can make a case that a relative of his , especially his brother , is the donor, then
that goes a long way towards explaining away the coincidental
similarity between the suspect and the evidence. The defense always
needs to be aware of this possibility.  There are other computations that can be made to deal with situations where relatives of the suspect (even distant relatives ) 
may be worth considering.  heterogeneous population  The application of the product rule presumes that the relevant 
loci and population be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium . 

These population genetic concepts have been found to hold to a
reasonable degree of accuracy for major populations and typical
forensically used loci. For mixed populations and inbred populations
the product rule is not as accurate. To the extent that the product
rule is inaccurate, the error usually works against suspect, unfairly
exaggerating the strength of the evidence.  Omitted topics  It is beyond the ambition of this section to discuss computations
for DNA identification when the evidence consists of a mixture ( "Interpreting DNA mixtures" ) 

from several people, or how to analyze when the suspect is found
through a database search, or how to analyze relationship cases
including paternity and missing bodies .  1.  Contact: forensic mathematics   Top of this page
