By Sarah Begley  August 23, 2017       People have been snapping up Powerball tickets around the country in hopes of winning the second-biggest jackpot of all time: $700 million. But the odds of winning Wednesday night’s drawing are remote — about one in 292 million.  Until a rule change in 2015, the odds were more favorable at one in 175 million.  The difference is that the total number of balls to pick from increased from 59 to 69, with players picking five, the Washington Post reports . The new odds are roughly akin to one person being randomly selected among the entire U.S. population of 323 million.   Still, for many, the long odds are worth the $2 risk — and if no one wins Wednesday night’s drawing, the jackpot will likely swell above the previous record of $1.6 billion.

For the uninitiated Powerball players who may have impulsively purchased a ticket, we decided to break down all the possible ways you can win . You know, just in case. First, the basics. The Powerball lotto is made up of 6 total numbers randomly selected twice per week. Every Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. EST, a live drawing is held. All the numbers are printed on white or red balls, and placed into an automated machine which spits out the winning digits. The first 5 numbers (white) are between 1 and 69. The final number (red) is called the Powerball. It can be anywhere between 1 and 26. When purchasing a ticket, players can select all 6 numbers themselves or do a "quick pick" and receive a randomly generated set of numbers. Tickets are $2 each, but you can pay an extra $1 at the time of purchase to upgrade your ticket to "Power Play." The "Power Play" add-on means your cash prize will, at minimum, double if you have a winning ticket for anything other than the grand prize jackpot. So, what exactly are the winning tickets (aside from the jackpot)? The possible winning tickets and their cash prizes are as follows: Match all 5 white numbers only — $1 million Match 4 out of 5 white numbers + Powerball — $50,000 Match 4 white numbers only — $100 Match 3 white numbers + Powerball — $100 Match 3 white numbers only — $7 Match 2 white numbers + Powerball — $7 Match 1 white number + Powerball — $4 Powerball only — $4 The "Power Play" bonus is announced at the drawing time, and does not apply to the jackpot winnings. If you've matched all 5 white numbers and selected "Power Play" at the time of your ticket purchase, you will win $2 million (instead of the standard $1 million). For all other prizes, the "Power Play" bonus with either be 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x your winnings. Associated Press In the most recent drawing from January 9, Powerball announced there were 28 tickets sold with all 5 white numbers . The winners of the $1 million prize have not all claimed their cash yet, but most states give players at least 180 days to come forward . Overall odds of winning any of the prizes starting at $4 is 1 in 24.87 . On the off-chance you do take home a lump sum, don't forget to hire a lawyer . The next Powerball drawing takes place Wednesday, January 13 at 10:59 p.m. EST. UPDATE: The winning numbers drawn Wednesday were 8, 27, 34, 4, 19 — Powerball 10. Reports indicate three jackpot winners will split the grand prize of $1.5 billion.     Read the original article on Tech Insider . Follow Tech Insider on Facebook and Twitter . Copyright 2018.

Home >   How To Play          How to Play   Mega Millions tickets cost $2.00 per play.  Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers - five different numbers from 1 to 70 and one number from 1 to 25 - or select Easy Pick/Quick Pick. You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.  The jackpots start at $40 million and grow by a minimum of $5 million per draw each time the jackpot rolls.  There are a total of nine ways to win a prize in Mega Millions, ranging from the jackpot down to $2:    * In California , all prizes are pari-mutuel, meaning payouts are based on sales and the number of winners. All other Mega Millions states set the 2nd through 9th prizes at pre-determined amounts.   What if you win the jackpot?  Annuity option: The Mega Millions annuity is paid out as one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. Each payment is 5% bigger than the previous one. This helps protect winners’ lifestyle and purchasing power in periods of inflation. See more information about the annuity option .  Cash option: A one-time, lump-sum payment that is equal to all the cash in the Mega Millions jackpot prize pool.   Just the Jackpot  In some states, a special offer called Just the Jackpot is available. Jackpot players will love this exciting new wager type that allows them to play specifically for the jackpot only. At a price of $3, the player will receive two plays for the jackpot only. Just the Jackpot tickets are not eligible for any other prize levels. To see if the lottery in your jurisdiction offers this option, visit that lottery’s website (you can find links on our “ Where to Play ” page).   Megaplier  Most states offer a Megaplier feature to increase non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4 or 5 times; it costs an additional $1 per play.  Before each Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday and Friday nights, the Megaplier is drawn. From a pool of 15 balls, five are marked with 2X, six with 3X, three with 4X and one with 5X. This mix results in the following odds for each of the Megaplier numbers and their associated prize values:             Random Number Generator    Play Responsibly    Difference Between Cash Value and Annuity                    ©2017 Mega Millions.

While there are many factors that determine the advertised Grand Prize estimate in the Powerball® game; two important ones are games sales and the annuity factor .  A number of variables can affect game sales, such as seasonality or a big Mega Millions jackpot. Traditionally, game sales are stronger for a Saturday drawing versus a Wednesday drawing.  The annuity factor, or the cost to fund an annuity prize, is another key component. The annuity factor is made up of interest rates for securities purchased to fund prize payments. The higher the interest rates, the higher the advertised Grand Prize. You might not realize that an economic reality like interest rates impact even the Powerball jackpot, but they do!    Are you sure your odds are right? Most players think the odds of matching the Powerball to win a prize are 1 in 26, since the Powerball is drawn from a field of numbers from 1 to 26.  But consider this…  The odds of matching the Powerball ALONE are harder than 1 in 26, because there is also the chance you could match one or more white balls, in addition to the Powerball, to win another prize.  Powerball numbers are drawn from two sets of numbers, so the odds of winning a prize are calculated by combining the odds for both sets of numbers for all prize levels. The odds for matching just the Powerball are calculated by combining the odds of selecting the Powerball and the odds of not selecting any of the five numbers from the first set of numbers drawn.    How late can I purchase Powerball tickets? Sales cut-off times vary by one to two hours before the drawings on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, depending on the selling jurisdiction.    Can I purchase Powerball tickets over the Internet? Some lotteries sell Powerball® tickets over the Internet, but the service is only available to residents of that jurisdiction. The sale of Powerball tickets over the Internet or by mail across jurisdictional borders is restricted. Lotteries may refuse to pay out prize money on Powerball tickets purchased on any website other than their own. Please contact your lottery with any further questions.    Do you have to be a U.S. citizen or resident to play Powerball? You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident to play Powerball®. Players from jurisdictions where Powerball tickets are not sold, either in the United States or outside the country, can purchase Powerball tickets from a retailer licensed or authorized by the selling jurisdiction, if they meet the legal age requirement in the jurisdiction of purchase. Federal and jurisdictional income taxes may apply to any claimed prize money.    When is the 10X multiplier in play? The 10X multiplier is only in play when the advertised jackpot annuity is $150 million or less.    Do I have to match the numbers in the exact order drawn? Powerball® tickets print the white ball numbers in numerical order of a given play. You can match the white ball numbers in any order of a given play to win a prize. The red Powerball number of a given play on your ticket must match the red Powerball drawn. Each play on a ticket is separately determined; players cannot crisscross play lines on a ticket or combine numbers from other tickets.    How can I claim my prize? Prizes must be claimed in the jurisdiction where the winning ticket was purchased. Players can generally claim a prize up to $600 at any licensed lottery retailer in the jurisdiction where they bought the ticket. Prizes over $600 can be claimed at some lottery offices, depending on the amount, and also at lottery headquarters. Please contact your lottery with any further questions.    How long do I have to claim my prize? Ticket expiration dates vary from 90 days to one year, depending on the selling jurisdiction. The expiration date is often listed on the back of your ticket. If the expiration date is not listed, check with your lottery.    What happens to unclaimed prizes? Unclaimed prizes are kept by the lottery jurisdiction. If a Grand Prize goes unclaimed, the money must be returned to all lotteries in proportion to their sales for the draw run. The lotteries then distribute the money, based on their own jurisdiction's laws, to other lottery games or to their jurisdiction's general fund, or otherwise as required by law.    Can Powerball winners remain anonymous? Every jurisdiction has its own law on winners remaining anonymous. Some jurisdictions are required by law to provide the winner's name, city of residence, game won and prize amount to any third party that requests the information. Other jurisdictions allow winners to create trusts to shield their names from the public, or otherwise claim prizes anonymously. Check with your lottery to see if taking a photo of the winner is required and what its rules are on prize claims. Even if you keep your identity secret from the media and the public, you will have to be known to the lottery so officials can confirm you are eligible to play and win, as well as other legal requirements.    What is the difference between the annuity and cash value option? A Powerball jackpot winner may choose to receive their prize in 30 payments over 29 years or a lump-sum payment. The cash value option, in general, is the amount of money required to be in the jackpot prize pool, on the day of the drawing, to fund the estimated jackpot annuity prize. The advertised jackpot annuity and cash value are estimates until ticket sales are final, and for the annuity, until the Multi-State Lottery Association takes bids on the purchase of securities.  Federal and jurisdictional income taxes apply to both jackpot prize options.  Check with your lottery for its rules on how to claim a jackpot prize and the correct procedure for selecting the annuity or cash value option.     What happens to an annuitized prize if the winner dies? If a jackpot winner dies before receiving all annual installments, the balance of the prize will be paid to the winner's estate. Upon receipt of a court order, annual prize payments will continue to be paid to the winner's heirs. Other provisions may also apply depending on the laws of the lottery paying the prize.    I got an email asking me to send money to collect a Powerball prize. Is it legitimate? Lotteries will never contact you via email or telephone call to inform you that you’ve won a prize, unless you specifically entered an official lottery promotion or contest.  In addition, lotteries will never ask you to pay a fee to collect a Powerball prize. If you are asked to pay a fee to claim a prize, you are likely being scammed, and you should not share any personal or banking information with those entities.    Is Powerball giving away prize money on Facebook? In the past, Facebook users have reported notices that indicate Powerball is giving away prize money on Facebook. These notices are false and fraudulent. Lotteries do not contact prize winners through Facebook, unless you specifically entered an official lottery promotion or contest.    What's the math behind the How Tall is $40 million feature? A United States $100 bill is .0043 inches thick.  Ten thousand $100 bills equals $1 million (10,000 x $100 = $1,000,000).  Therefore, a $1 million stack of $100 bills is 43 inches tall (10,000 x .0043 inches = 43 inches).  43 inches = 3.5833 feet  A stack of one hundred dollar bills equaling $40,000,000 is 143.33 feet tall (40 x 3.5833 feet = 143.33 feet).                  ×   Search Result           Keep Up With the Winning Numbers in Powerball!

          Updated Dec 29, 2017 2:14 PM EST   'Tis the season to start dreaming: Prizes for the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries have climbed past $300 million , with drawings set for Friday and Saturday. But don't quit your day job just yet. The odds of winning one of the jackpots is roughly one in 259 million for Mega Millions and one in 292 million for Powerball. And the chances of winning both, for those of you thinking really big? Roughly one in 75 quadrillion -- that's 15 zeros -- according to data scientists at Allstate. To understand how unlikely those odds are, it's worth comparing them to the probability of other unlikely events. Americans are much more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of one in 13,500) or to die in a car accident (one in 645). While the old lottery campaign "You've got to be in it to win it" holds true, the real value in buying a ticket may simply be to enjoy the dream of winning.     The Powerball website announced Thursday that no winning tickets had been sold. The estimated top prize for the next drawing on Saturday night is $384 million, or a cash prize of $242.9 million. The estimated Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million (or a cash option of $191 million), with the next drawing set for Friday at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets cost $2. Sales time cut-offs vary by state but are usually one to two hours before the drawing. The average American spends about $200 a year on lottery tickets , though residents of some states spend far more. According to a study by LendEDU, the average Massachusetts resident spends $735 annually on lottery tickets . Rhode Islanders plop down $514 a year. And if you live in Delaware or New York, you're likely spending about $400 a year, or $33 per month (see map below). The odds of winning "scratchers" -- those little instant winning tickets that you can buy for prices ranging from $1 to $50 -- are better, but it's still no way to get rich. LendEDU experimented with determining "a return on investment" with scratchers by buying $1,000 worth of tickets. The good news: The site won with 68 of the 314 tickets -- indicating that you have a near 22 percent chance of a positive return with lottery scratchers. And, in fact, a big win ($500) on a $20 ticket helped the lending site recover the bulk of its investment. The bad news: Like most players, LendEDU lost money in the end, recovering just $974 of its $1,000. That amounts to an average return on investment of -2.6 percent. So who does make out in lottery sales? Convenience stores. Big jackpots tend to bring customers into gas stations and convenience stores, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores. Its members sell about two-thirds of all lottery tickets in the U.S. The giant Powerball and Mega Million jackpots are feeding on each other, with customers coming into stores to buy a ticket for one and noticing the other jackpot, he said.     "The key thing for awareness is really, once you go into the store to buy one, there's that screen that shows that there's another big jackpot," Lenard said. "It's that digital signage inside the store that's driving that double interest." Convenience stores make about a dime on a $2 ticket, or about 5 percent to 6 percent on each dollar spent. Winning stores also earn a commission, although the amount varies by state. Following are the odds of winning the jackpots, as calculated by Allstate, along with the chances of other unlikely events: Being a victim of identity theft by the age of 40 : 1 in 6 Getting bitten by a dog while out for a jog : 1 in 133 Getting a hole in one on your birthday : 1 in 25,000 Having all of the above happen to one person : 1 in 19,900,000 Winning Powerball: 1 in 292,201,338 Winning Mega Millions : 1 in 258,890,850 Winning both Powerball and Mega Millions : 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

There was no winner of the jackpot in the most recent drawing on Jan. 3. And while the big prize isn’t quite as big as it was last August (when it topped $750 million), that’s not stopping people from dreaming of what could be. But even the most optimistic players realize they’re probably not going to win it all.  As of Wednesday morning, the odds of winning the lottery stood at one in 292.2 million. How does that compare to other unlikely events? Short answer, it’s not good news…  To put things in context, consider this: The 1980 U.S. Men’s hockey team victory over the U.S.S.R—the “Miracle on Ice”—only had odds of 1,000 to one. But it gets much worse from there.      For instance, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, your odds of being struck by lightning this year are 1 in 1,083,000 – and, over the course of your lifetime, those drop to about 1 in 13,500.  Speaking of things falling from the sky, you’ve got a one in 1,600,000 chance of dying from a local meteorite , asteroid, or comet impact, according to a 2014 paper by Tulane University earth sciences professor Stephen A. Nelson.  The odds of being killed by a shark are 1 in 3,748,067. And that’s nothing compared to your odds of dying in a Grand Canyon flash flood, which stand at 1 in 14,270,000, according to The Book of Odds.  And even if you really show up the oddsmakers and make three consecutive holes in one the next time you hit the links, it still won’t put you close to your chances of winning Powerball. Your chances of such a successful day on the Greens currently stand at ‘just’ 156,250,000 to 1.

The odds that you'll win the $445 million jackpot in Friday's Mega Millions drawing are really, really bad.  And the odds that you'll win $550 million in the Powerball drawing Saturday are similarly stacked against you.    The likelihood of winning both? Forget about it.  The Mega Millions odds are 1 in 302.6 million. That's more than 2,000 times less likely than being killed by a lightening strike or an earthquake.   Related: Powerball jackpot grows to $550 million    The odds of winning Powerball are only slightly better -- 1 in 292.2 million.  If it seems like the odds are even worse than they used to be, they are.  Both games have increased the choice of numbers people can play, which makes it less likely that someone will get all six numbers right. Powerball lengthened its odds in late 2015, while Mega Millions made the change this past October.  Having jackpot winners less frequently means that the top prizes roll over more and get bigger. And that attracts even more players. Right now that cycle is working perfectly.  In fact, this is the first time ever that both games have offered jackpots of $400 million or more at the same time.  And that's prompting people to buy tickets to both games, rather than just one or the other.   Related: What tax reform means for the next big lottery winner   So that raises the question, what are the chance of winning both games this week and walking away with jackpots totaling nearly $1 billion?  That would be 1 in 88 quadrillion, or 1 in 88,412,922,115,183,000 to be precise. If quadrillion isn't a term you deal with very often, think of it this way -- it's 88,000 trillion, or 88 million billion.  Or if you're one of those people who do better with percentages: You have a 0.0000000000000011% chance of winning both games.

The estimated jackpot for the next Mega Millions drawing , on Tuesday, January 2, is $343 million, while the Powerball jackpot scheduled for Wednesday is up to a whopping $440 million.  There have been much higher multi-state lottery jackpots in recent history: In early 2016, for instance, the Powerball grand prize hit a mind-blowing $1.5 billion , and last August, a woman from Massachusetts won the biggest individual Powerball prize ever, worth nearly $760 million before taxes. At one point in late 2013, the Mega Millions jackpot hit $550 million .  According to CNBC , however, this week marks only the second time in history that both the Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots surpassed $300 million at the same time.      Such an event probably won’t be much of a rarity going forward, though, thanks to changes to both lottery games that push jackpots ever higher—while simultaneously decreasing the odds of winning.  Powerball’s new rules went into effect in the fall of 2015, when the set of numbers players choose from increased from 59 to 69 . The takeaway was that the odds of winning, which had previously been 1 in 175 million, became even less likely, at roughly 1 in 292 million.  The upside for Powerball players is that as fewer people have been hitting the jackpot, the grand prizes keep rolling over and keep getting bigger. Hence the epic Powerball jackpots we saw last summer and in early 2016 . And hence the increased excitement and rising Powerball ticket sales nationally whenever the jackpots head into the stratosphere.     More recent changes to Mega Millions were also instituted with the idea that they would push jackpots higher. Starting in October 2017, the price of a Mega Millions ticket doubled from $1 to $2, and the game was redesigned in terms of the number of balls players can choose from. As a result, the odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot became worse overnight, going from roughly 1 in 259 million to 1 in 303 million.  More people will be playing Mega Millions anyway. Why? The redesigned game also increased the opening Mega Millions jackpot, from $15 million to $40 million. What’s more, similarly to Powerball, the jackpots have been growing exponentially quicker and larger—because players are paying more for tickets, and because as fewer people win the grand prize soars higher and higher.      The way things are going, it won’t be all that unusual in the future for both Mega Millions and Powerball to have jackpots over $300 million, or even $500 million. And if the jackpots for both hit $1 billion at the same time, you can expect lottery hysteria—and sales of Mega Millions and Powerball tickets—to ratchet up to levels no one’s ever seen.

By Sarah Begley  August 23, 2017       People have been snapping up Powerball tickets around the country in hopes of winning the second-biggest jackpot of all time: $700 million. But the odds of winning Wednesday night’s drawing are remote — about one in 292 million.  Until a rule change in 2015, the odds were more favorable at one in 175 million.  The difference is that the total number of balls to pick from increased from 59 to 69, with players picking five, the Washington Post reports . The new odds are roughly akin to one person being randomly selected among the entire U.S. population of 323 million.   Still, for many, the long odds are worth the $2 risk — and if no one wins Wednesday night’s drawing, the jackpot will likely swell above the previous record of $1.6 billion.

Kevin Breuninger | @KevinWilliamB   Published  1:12  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  Updated   1:42  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  CNBC.com                show chapters               U.S. lottery players now have two chances at jackpots of more than $300 million   4:30  PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:37       If your retirement plan involves winning either of this weekend's multi-million dollar lottery jackpots, sorry — you're far more likely to be killed by a falling asteroid.   The combined Powerball and the Mega Millions jackpots are the largest ever , at more than $1 billion. The Powerball jackpot is currently $570 million, and the Mega Millions stands at $450 million. Both games had their most recent jackpot wins in late October.  The next Mega Millions drawing is scheduled for 11 p.m. ET on Friday, and the next Powerball drawing is Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.   Two lottery drawings does technically imply more opportunities to win — but really, you should check your hopes at the convenience store counter.  The odds of winning the Powerball grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to the game's own assessment . The Mega Millions jackpot odds are even more hopeless, at 1 in 302.5 million.  (In late October, Mega Millions changed its range of numbers players can choose from, which made the odds of winning the big jackpot slimmer. Before that change, its jackpot odds were 1 in 258.9 million.)  A few points of comparison. Your odds of being struck dead by a stray asteroid are just 1 in 1.9 million, according to Jim Murphy at sportsbettingexperts.com . The odds of being killed by a shark are even less likely at 1 in 3.7 million.       Getty Images   Yet both of these improbabilities are exponentially more likely than winning the whole bonanza in either of this weekend's lottery drawings.  And perish the thought of winning both the Mega Millions and the Powerball. An Allstate analysis from mid-2017 (before the Mega Millions top prize odds worsened) put the chance of a double-win at 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300. (That's 75 quadrillion.)  For those lucky few who do win the lottery, be prepared to sacrifice a hefty chunk of your winnings in tax payments almost immediately.  Lottery site USAMega.com estimates the federal tax withholding on the $281.2 million Mega Millions lump sum would be $70.3 million, and state taxes could knock out up to another $24.8 million (with New York the worst offender). For the Powerball, those tax tallies for the $358.5 million cash prize would be $89.6 million and up to $31.6 million, respectively.

Just kidding, that's Jenny's number . Not to say that would be the worst choice. Your odds of winning this week’s record Powerball jackpot with Jenny's help, or any other combination of numbers, are pretty bad. How bad? Like one in more than 292 million bad. Or put another way, barely better odds than having your name randomly pulled from a hat filled with the names of everyone in the US. But you're an optimist, right? I say that and you figure I'm telling you there's a chance . And behind every game of chance is some fascinating math. Powerball is like normal lottery with a twist. You pick five numbers—ranging from one through 69—which pop up as white balls in the eventual drawing. A final, yellow Powerball only ranges from one to 26, but always comes last. The one-in-292-million odds come from all the different combinations you can win by picking the right five white balls—in any order—out of a drum of 69. "Multiplied by 26, because for every five-ball combination you've got 26 different associated Powerballs," says University of Buffalo statistician Jeffrey Miecznikowski . And for the jackpot, those odds never change. Your odds of winning tomorrow's $1.4 billion (and counting) jackpot are exactly the same as they were of winning in November, when the pot was a mere $40 million.

Now Here's What You Do: Nothing Sarah Mitroff Being Filthy Rich Doesn't Buy Happiness, But Raises Do Which means—at the very least—you’re better off buying a ticket now than you were then. This gets into something statisticians call “expected return." Simply put, this is your odds of winning multiplied by the potential payout. If the odds were perfect, and you could never lose, then the expected return would be $40 million: a fantastic investment. If you buy one Powerball ticket, giving you a one in 292 million chance of winning $1.4 billion, your expected return is almost $5 on that $2 ticket—a great investment. But wait: Powerball's expected return is actually way, way lower than that. How low? First off, you only get $1.4 billion if you accept the payout over 30 years. If you want it all at once, your bounty drops to $868 million. Then you gotta pay taxes. I’m going to assume you’re not already rich, and therefore do not have a cabal of Randian lawyers standing between your money and the government. Which means you're losing about 40 percent at the federal tax rate. Oh and also, the IRS withholds an extra 25 to 28 percent because you struck it rich gambling. If you’re lucky enough to live somewhere without state taxes, you take home around $524 million. Otherwise, your pot could be as "little" as $394 million—but multiplied by 1/292,000,000, your expected return on a $2 ticket is about $1.79 at the high end, and $1.35 at the low. That's all back-of-the-napkin math, but the answer tells you what you need to know: If your expected return is less than your investment, put your money towards something else. Now, that expected return will get better as long as the jackpot keeps growing. Unless game goes on too long. "The higher the jackpot, the more people you can expect to play, so that $1.4 billion jackpot is more likely to get split in multiple ways," says Miecznikowski. Exactly how much those odds change is difficult to figure out, because you'd have to know exactly how many Powerball tickets have been sold. For obvious reasons, the Multi-State Lottery Association keeps that number under wraps. You could estimate based on the jackpot size. This week's $1.4 billion is $450 million higher than Saturday's prize. The jackpot is about 32.5 percent of the base buy-in rate, plus whatever was leftover from last time. At face value, that would mean more than 146 million people have bought tickets. However, that doesn’t account for people paying extra money for multipliers should they win. And of course, these calculations don’t take human fallibility into account. "Not all combinations are equally likely to be chosen by people," says Miecznikowski. For instance, people who choose their own numbers often use birth dates. This is fine when you are choosing the yellow Powerball, which only goes up to 26, but white balls go up to 69. That leaves 32 through 69 underrepresented. "And on Saturday, the Powerball number was 13. Superstitious folks are less likely to choose that," says Miecznikowski. Your best bet, he adds, is to let the computer choose your numbers. By the way, these long odds are by design. In October 2015, the non-profit organization controlling Powerball changed the format, increasing the range of white balls from 59 to 69, while lowering the range of Powerballs from 35 to 26. The odds dropped from one in 175 million to one in 292 million. This simultaneously did two things: made it easier to win low-stakes payouts (guessing just the Powerball nets you $4), and much, much harder to win the jackpot. This incentivizes more people to play, and makes the game harder to win. "By making the odds more difficult, it guaranteed record jackpots because it is rolling over every time," says Miecznikowski. "The publicity that Powerball has gotten setting record jackpots has really fueled popularity of the game." In other words, you're playing against a bigger and bigger crowd. But hey, may the odds be ever in your favor. #math #money #statistics Most Popular gear 4 Best Smartphones of 2018: Guide to Android, Samsung Galaxy, iPhone Author: Jeffrey Van Camp Jeffrey Van Camp gear How to Check If Cambridge Analytica Could Access Your Facebook Data Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett transportation Porsche's 919 Hybrid Evo Wallops F1's Fastest Cars Author: Jack Stewart Jack Stewart More Stories View Comments Sponsored Stories Powered By Outbrain Megan Molteni With Some Structure, Stem Cells Might Still Stop Vision Loss Adam Rogers Too Much Engineering Has Made Mississippi River Floods Worse Sarah Scoles The Woman Who Knows Everything About the Universe Stephen Wolfram *2001: A Space Odyssey* Predicted the Future—50 Years Ago Matt Simon Why These Bumblebees Are Wearing Itty-Bitty QR Codes More science Math What Random Walks in Multiple Dimensions Teach You About Life Author: Rhett Allain Rhett Allain Genetics Helix Takes Clinical Genetic Testing Straight to Consumers Author: Megan Molteni Megan Molteni NASA Inside the Cleanroom Where the Mars Lander Preps for Launch Author: Matt Simon Matt Simon Thought Experiments New Brain Maps With Unmatched Detail May Change Neuroscience Author: Monique Brouillette Monique Brouillette gallery The Case of the Missing Dark Matter Author: Shannon Stirone Shannon Stirone Math Why Winning in Rock-Paper-Scissors Isn’t Everything Author: Patrick Honner Patrick Honner We Recommend Powered By Outbrain Adam Rogers A Month's Worth of Rain Will Hit California This Weekend Robbie Gonzalez A Brain-Boosting Prosthesis Moves From Rats to Humans Eric Niiler From AI to Russia, Here’s How Estonia’s President Is Planning for the Future Rhett Allain Do You Weigh More at the Equator or at the North Pole?

It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money .  Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59  p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play. [1] Each play costs $2, or $3 with the Power Play option. (Originally, Powerball plays cost $1; when PowerPlay began, such games were $2.) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00  p.m. Eastern Time; some lotteries cut off sales earlier. [2] The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery ’s studio in Tallahassee .  On January 13, 2016, Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills, California , [3] [4] in Munford, Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach, Florida .

In 2013, Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery; the next year, it began, initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball.  History [ edit ]  1988 precursor: Lotto America [ edit ]  Powerball's predecessor began in 1988; [6] the multi-state game was known as Lotto America . The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.  Powerball begins [ edit ]  When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by The Big Game (now Mega Millions ) in the US, Australia's Powerball , Thunderball in the UK , Eurojackpot and EuroMillions (unlike most two-drum games, Euromillions selects two numbers called "Lucky Stars" from the 2nd drum; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches).  Through 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines, Iowa . The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace , who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went "on the road" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new The Big Game , then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.  On November 2, 1997, the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added. [7] The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.  In 1998, Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.  On March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called Power Play ) was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel.)  2009: Florida became host to drawings [ edit ]  With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.  Based on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.  The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando . The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a random number generator (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.  Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009, [8] the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010; it joined Mega Millions (along with New York) years earlier, when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name.  2010 cross-sell expansion [ edit ]  In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On Oct 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. [9] In Nov, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online. [10] [11]  On Jan 31, 2010, the date of the cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May. The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1. Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20; Oregon followed on March 28; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16. The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010.  Before the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the Sharon, Pennsylvania / Masury, Ohio border sold both Mega Millions (via the Ohio Lottery ) and Powerball ( Pennsylvania ) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries. [12]  Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation  WGN-TV through its national WGN America feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox owned-and-operated station  WFLD in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.  On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in Morris Plains . On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).  On June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.  2012 format change [ edit ]  On January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million. [13] A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million. The red balls decreased from 39 to 35. [14] The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery’s studios in Tallahassee. Sam Arlen served as host, with Alexa Fuentes substituting.  These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine-figure jackpots; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible (it became a reality within the year, [15] ) and that the 1st $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 [16] Less than three months after the Powerball changes, Mega Millions' jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1-per-play game. [17] The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set, fixed dollar amount payout. [18] The $25 million rollover "cap" (creating larger 5+0 prizes) was eliminated.  California joined on April 8, 2013; it has never offered the Power Play option, as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games, by law, are parimutuel . Mega Millions, which became available in California in 2005, offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions.  On January 22, 2014, the variable Power Play option returned (2x-5x) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes. [18]  In October 2014, Puerto Rico joined Powerball; the first mainly Spanish-speaking jurisdiction offering the game; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions.  2015 format change [ edit ]  On Oct 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338. [19] The 4+1 prize became $50,000; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million. [20] Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers. [19] [21]  Playing the game [ edit ]  Basic game [ edit ]  The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called "quick pick", "easy pick", etc.).  In each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.  Two identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey . There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display.

[20]  While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75 + 1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.  Power Play [ edit ]  For an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.  The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.  Power Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5× spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10×. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10× multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10× space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10× multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10× multiplier was not drawn until June 12. The second prize 5× guarantee continued; the 10× applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.  Power Play′s success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably Megaplier , available through all Mega Millions members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having "fixed" Power Play prizes.

Only a "lottery" was authorized by the state Lottery Act. Therefore, Power Play is not offered in California.  ^ a  b  $2,000,000 fixed for match 5+0 with Power Play as of 2012 format change.  ^ a  b  Power Play multipliers do not apply to jackpot. Jackpot is split among multiple winners.     § Odds of winning 0+1 prize are 1:38.32 instead of 1:26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball . [26]  All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts (except in California); they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis, with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier, if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member. [27]  Jackpot accumulation and payment options [ edit ]  Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash (in two installments; one from the winning jurisdiction, then the combined funds from the other members) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments. Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation. [28]  The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. [2] The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non- Power Play ) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.  MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used. [2]  When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.  Claiming prizes [ edit ]  A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19); and Arizona, Iowa, and Louisiana (21).  Generally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose.) Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60-day " clock " starts with the drawing, so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. New Jersey and Texas require the cash/annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding (when the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.  Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only. There is no state income tax in Florida , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming , and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire . Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)  Secondary prizes [ edit ]  Unlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.  Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables. [29] Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.  Notable wins [ edit ]  Main article: Lottery jackpot records § United States  Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids. [30]  On August 23, 2017, the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee, Massachusetts won more than $750 million, one of the largest prizes in the lottery's history. [31]  On January 13, 2016, the world's largest lottery jackpot, an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion, was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills, California , Melbourne Beach, Florida and Munford, Tennessee , each worth $528.8 million. Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee (and California does not tax lottery winnings), the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each. [32]  On May 18, 2013, the world's largest one-ticket jackpot, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($620 million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida . [33] On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner: Gloria C. MacKenzie, 84, who purchased the "quick pick" ticket at a Publix supermarket. [34] MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding; Florida does not have a state income tax. [34]  Other winners in excess of $250 million: On December 25, 2002, Jack Whittaker , president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia , won $314.9 million ($428 million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings. [35]  On October 19, 2005, the West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million ($426 million today). [36] The Wests chose the cash payout of $164.4 million (before withholdings), smaller than Whittaker's cash payout in 2002 due to a then-recent change in the annuity structure.  A jackpot of $365 million ($443 million today) was won on February 18, 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska . It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant. [37] The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million, before withholdings.  On August 25, 2007, a jackpot worth $314 million ($371 million today) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond, Indiana , a community that had previously sold a jackpot-winning ticket of over $200 million. [38]  In November 2011, three Greenwich, Connecticut , financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ($277 million today), the largest prize on a Connecticut-bought ticket. Choosing the cash option, the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings. The jackpot, at the time, was the 12th largest in Powerball history. [39]  Fortune cookie payout [ edit ]  The Powerball drawing on March 30, 2005, produced 110 second-prize winners. The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million, with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each, while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections.  MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error. However, all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City, New York . The factory had printed the numbers "22, 28, 32, 33, 39, 40" on thousands of fortunes. The "40" in the fortune did not match the Powerball number, 42. None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers; at the time, the closest game member was Connecticut . [40] Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play, the payouts were made. [41]  Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number, these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot: each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash (before withholdings). [42] The fortune on the cookie read: "All the preparation you've done will finally be paying off." [40]  Computers and slot machines [ edit ]  In 2006, WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name. In 2007, the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real-time. The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements.  The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010. Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card, with 12 opportunities to match. Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won. The top prize was $1 million (annuity); unlike actual Powerball, there was no cash option for the top prize.

The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot. Now, when the Powerball Lottery jackpot is reset after a win it will start at $40 million, tempting even more players in for those early draws. Another promise, that is sure to be popular with lottery players, is the introduction of more prizes. From January, Powerball players will have even better odds of winning a prize worth at least $1 million, and it’s that fact that may soften the third and biggest ever change. From January 15, 2012, Powerball Lottery tickets are doubling in price, in what is the biggest change to the Powerball Lottery draw since its launch in 1994.   ^  Lokay, Jim.

It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money .  Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59  p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play. [1] Each play costs $2, or $3 with the Power Play option. (Originally, Powerball plays cost $1; when PowerPlay began, such games were $2.) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00  p.m. Eastern Time; some lotteries cut off sales earlier. [2] The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery ’s studio in Tallahassee .  On January 13, 2016, Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills, California , [3] [4] in Munford, Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach, Florida .

In 2013, Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery; the next year, it began, initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball.  History [ edit ]  1988 precursor: Lotto America [ edit ]  Powerball's predecessor began in 1988; [6] the multi-state game was known as Lotto America . The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.  Powerball begins [ edit ]  When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by The Big Game (now Mega Millions ) in the US, Australia's Powerball , Thunderball in the UK , Eurojackpot and EuroMillions (unlike most two-drum games, Euromillions selects two numbers called "Lucky Stars" from the 2nd drum; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches).  Through 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines, Iowa . The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace , who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went "on the road" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new The Big Game , then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.  On November 2, 1997, the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added. [7] The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.  In 1998, Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.  On March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called Power Play ) was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel.)  2009: Florida became host to drawings [ edit ]  With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.  Based on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.  The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando . The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a random number generator (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.  Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009, [8] the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010; it joined Mega Millions (along with New York) years earlier, when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name.  2010 cross-sell expansion [ edit ]  In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On Oct 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. [9] In Nov, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online. [10] [11]  On Jan 31, 2010, the date of the cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May. The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1. Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20; Oregon followed on March 28; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16. The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010.  Before the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the Sharon, Pennsylvania / Masury, Ohio border sold both Mega Millions (via the Ohio Lottery ) and Powerball ( Pennsylvania ) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries. [12]  Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation  WGN-TV through its national WGN America feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox owned-and-operated station  WFLD in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.  On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in Morris Plains . On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).  On June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.  2012 format change [ edit ]  On January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million. [13] A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million. The red balls decreased from 39 to 35. [14] The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery’s studios in Tallahassee. Sam Arlen served as host, with Alexa Fuentes substituting.  These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine-figure jackpots; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible (it became a reality within the year, [15] ) and that the 1st $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 [16] Less than three months after the Powerball changes, Mega Millions' jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1-per-play game. [17] The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set, fixed dollar amount payout. [18] The $25 million rollover "cap" (creating larger 5+0 prizes) was eliminated.  California joined on April 8, 2013; it has never offered the Power Play option, as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games, by law, are parimutuel . Mega Millions, which became available in California in 2005, offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions.  On January 22, 2014, the variable Power Play option returned (2x-5x) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes. [18]  In October 2014, Puerto Rico joined Powerball; the first mainly Spanish-speaking jurisdiction offering the game; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions.  2015 format change [ edit ]  On Oct 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338. [19] The 4+1 prize became $50,000; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million. [20] Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers. [19] [21]  Playing the game [ edit ]  Basic game [ edit ]  The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called "quick pick", "easy pick", etc.).  In each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.  Two identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey . There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display.

[20]  While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75 + 1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.  Power Play [ edit ]  For an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.  The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.  Power Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5× spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10×. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10× multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10× space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10× multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10× multiplier was not drawn until June 12. The second prize 5× guarantee continued; the 10× applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.  Power Play′s success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably Megaplier , available through all Mega Millions members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having "fixed" Power Play prizes.

Only a "lottery" was authorized by the state Lottery Act. Therefore, Power Play is not offered in California.  ^ a  b  $2,000,000 fixed for match 5+0 with Power Play as of 2012 format change.  ^ a  b  Power Play multipliers do not apply to jackpot. Jackpot is split among multiple winners.     § Odds of winning 0+1 prize are 1:38.32 instead of 1:26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball . [26]  All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts (except in California); they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis, with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier, if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member. [27]  Jackpot accumulation and payment options [ edit ]  Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash (in two installments; one from the winning jurisdiction, then the combined funds from the other members) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments. Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation. [28]  The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. [2] The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non- Power Play ) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.  MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used. [2]  When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.  Claiming prizes [ edit ]  A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19); and Arizona, Iowa, and Louisiana (21).  Generally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose.) Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60-day " clock " starts with the drawing, so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. New Jersey and Texas require the cash/annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding (when the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.  Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only. There is no state income tax in Florida , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming , and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire . Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)  Secondary prizes [ edit ]  Unlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.  Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables. [29] Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.  Notable wins [ edit ]  Main article: Lottery jackpot records § United States  Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids. [30]  On August 23, 2017, the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee, Massachusetts won more than $750 million, one of the largest prizes in the lottery's history. [31]  On January 13, 2016, the world's largest lottery jackpot, an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion, was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills, California , Melbourne Beach, Florida and Munford, Tennessee , each worth $528.8 million. Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee (and California does not tax lottery winnings), the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each. [32]  On May 18, 2013, the world's largest one-ticket jackpot, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($620 million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida . [33] On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner: Gloria C. MacKenzie, 84, who purchased the "quick pick" ticket at a Publix supermarket. [34] MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding; Florida does not have a state income tax. [34]  Other winners in excess of $250 million: On December 25, 2002, Jack Whittaker , president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia , won $314.9 million ($428 million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings. [35]  On October 19, 2005, the West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million ($426 million today). [36] The Wests chose the cash payout of $164.4 million (before withholdings), smaller than Whittaker's cash payout in 2002 due to a then-recent change in the annuity structure.  A jackpot of $365 million ($443 million today) was won on February 18, 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska . It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant. [37] The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million, before withholdings.  On August 25, 2007, a jackpot worth $314 million ($371 million today) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond, Indiana , a community that had previously sold a jackpot-winning ticket of over $200 million. [38]  In November 2011, three Greenwich, Connecticut , financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ($277 million today), the largest prize on a Connecticut-bought ticket. Choosing the cash option, the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings. The jackpot, at the time, was the 12th largest in Powerball history. [39]  Fortune cookie payout [ edit ]  The Powerball drawing on March 30, 2005, produced 110 second-prize winners. The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million, with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each, while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections.  MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error. However, all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City, New York . The factory had printed the numbers "22, 28, 32, 33, 39, 40" on thousands of fortunes. The "40" in the fortune did not match the Powerball number, 42. None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers; at the time, the closest game member was Connecticut . [40] Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play, the payouts were made. [41]  Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number, these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot: each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash (before withholdings). [42] The fortune on the cookie read: "All the preparation you've done will finally be paying off." [40]  Computers and slot machines [ edit ]  In 2006, WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name. In 2007, the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real-time. The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements.  The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010. Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card, with 12 opportunities to match. Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won. The top prize was $1 million (annuity); unlike actual Powerball, there was no cash option for the top prize.

The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot. Now, when the Powerball Lottery jackpot is reset after a win it will start at $40 million, tempting even more players in for those early draws. Another promise, that is sure to be popular with lottery players, is the introduction of more prizes. From January, Powerball players will have even better odds of winning a prize worth at least $1 million, and it’s that fact that may soften the third and biggest ever change. From January 15, 2012, Powerball Lottery tickets are doubling in price, in what is the biggest change to the Powerball Lottery draw since its launch in 1994.   ^  Lokay, Jim.

FILE - In this July 1, 2016, file photo, Mega Millions lottery tickets rest on a counter at a Pilot travel center near Burlington, N.C.  (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File)      You might want to purchase some Powerball or Mega Millions tickets today.  Both lottery games have jackpots over $300 million each. Currently, the Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million, and Powerball is at $384 million.  This is the second time ever that U.S. lottery players are presented with two chances to try for jackpots that exceed $300 million at the same time, according to CNBC .  Early August of 2017 marked the first time that both prizes reached over $300 million. Lucky winner Patricia Busking of Illinois took home $393 million in Mega Millions winnings. And after Powerball climbed to $758.7 million in late August, Mavis Wanczyk claimed the prize.    From now until the end of the year, there are two drawings left. The last Mega Millions drawing of 2017 will be on Friday at 11 p.m. ET. The final Powerball drawing of the year will be on Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.  So with two prizes exceeding $300 million, you now have double the chances of winning a huge jackpot. But which tickets might you want to buy more of?  Well, back in October of this year, when Mega Millions doubled its ticket price from $1 to $2, it also changed its range of numbers that players have to choose from ( more details here ). This change made the odds of winning $1 million or more slightly higher, but the chances of winning the full jackpot got longer, according to CNNMoney . This changed the odds from 1 in 258.9 million to 1 in 302.6 million.   In fact, Mega Millions odds are now tougher than Powerball, which is 1 in 292.2 million.  There's also the popular advice to join a lottery pool to boost your odds of winning. According to an article written by Forbes contributor Panos Mourdoukoutas, you can increase your chances of winning by 100 times by joining a pool where 100 people contribute $10 each.

By Sarah Begley  August 23, 2017       People have been snapping up Powerball tickets around the country in hopes of winning the second-biggest jackpot of all time: $700 million. But the odds of winning Wednesday night’s drawing are remote — about one in 292 million.  Until a rule change in 2015, the odds were more favorable at one in 175 million.  The difference is that the total number of balls to pick from increased from 59 to 69, with players picking five, the Washington Post reports . The new odds are roughly akin to one person being randomly selected among the entire U.S. population of 323 million.   Still, for many, the long odds are worth the $2 risk — and if no one wins Wednesday night’s drawing, the jackpot will likely swell above the previous record of $1.6 billion.

For the uninitiated Powerball players who may have impulsively purchased a ticket, we decided to break down all the possible ways you can win . You know, just in case. First, the basics. The Powerball lotto is made up of 6 total numbers randomly selected twice per week. Every Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. EST, a live drawing is held. All the numbers are printed on white or red balls, and placed into an automated machine which spits out the winning digits. The first 5 numbers (white) are between 1 and 69. The final number (red) is called the Powerball. It can be anywhere between 1 and 26. When purchasing a ticket, players can select all 6 numbers themselves or do a "quick pick" and receive a randomly generated set of numbers. Tickets are $2 each, but you can pay an extra $1 at the time of purchase to upgrade your ticket to "Power Play." The "Power Play" add-on means your cash prize will, at minimum, double if you have a winning ticket for anything other than the grand prize jackpot. So, what exactly are the winning tickets (aside from the jackpot)? The possible winning tickets and their cash prizes are as follows: Match all 5 white numbers only — $1 million Match 4 out of 5 white numbers + Powerball — $50,000 Match 4 white numbers only — $100 Match 3 white numbers + Powerball — $100 Match 3 white numbers only — $7 Match 2 white numbers + Powerball — $7 Match 1 white number + Powerball — $4 Powerball only — $4 The "Power Play" bonus is announced at the drawing time, and does not apply to the jackpot winnings. If you've matched all 5 white numbers and selected "Power Play" at the time of your ticket purchase, you will win $2 million (instead of the standard $1 million). For all other prizes, the "Power Play" bonus with either be 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x your winnings. Associated Press In the most recent drawing from January 9, Powerball announced there were 28 tickets sold with all 5 white numbers . The winners of the $1 million prize have not all claimed their cash yet, but most states give players at least 180 days to come forward . Overall odds of winning any of the prizes starting at $4 is 1 in 24.87 . On the off-chance you do take home a lump sum, don't forget to hire a lawyer . The next Powerball drawing takes place Wednesday, January 13 at 10:59 p.m. EST. UPDATE: The winning numbers drawn Wednesday were 8, 27, 34, 4, 19 — Powerball 10. Reports indicate three jackpot winners will split the grand prize of $1.5 billion.     Read the original article on Tech Insider . Follow Tech Insider on Facebook and Twitter . Copyright 2018.

Home >   How To Play          How to Play   Mega Millions tickets cost $2.00 per play.  Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers - five different numbers from 1 to 70 and one number from 1 to 25 - or select Easy Pick/Quick Pick. You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.  The jackpots start at $40 million and grow by a minimum of $5 million per draw each time the jackpot rolls.  There are a total of nine ways to win a prize in Mega Millions, ranging from the jackpot down to $2:    * In California , all prizes are pari-mutuel, meaning payouts are based on sales and the number of winners. All other Mega Millions states set the 2nd through 9th prizes at pre-determined amounts.   What if you win the jackpot?  Annuity option: The Mega Millions annuity is paid out as one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. Each payment is 5% bigger than the previous one. This helps protect winners’ lifestyle and purchasing power in periods of inflation. See more information about the annuity option .  Cash option: A one-time, lump-sum payment that is equal to all the cash in the Mega Millions jackpot prize pool.   Just the Jackpot  In some states, a special offer called Just the Jackpot is available. Jackpot players will love this exciting new wager type that allows them to play specifically for the jackpot only. At a price of $3, the player will receive two plays for the jackpot only. Just the Jackpot tickets are not eligible for any other prize levels. To see if the lottery in your jurisdiction offers this option, visit that lottery’s website (you can find links on our “ Where to Play ” page).   Megaplier  Most states offer a Megaplier feature to increase non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4 or 5 times; it costs an additional $1 per play.  Before each Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday and Friday nights, the Megaplier is drawn. From a pool of 15 balls, five are marked with 2X, six with 3X, three with 4X and one with 5X. This mix results in the following odds for each of the Megaplier numbers and their associated prize values:             Random Number Generator    Play Responsibly    Difference Between Cash Value and Annuity                    ©2017 Mega Millions.

While there are many factors that determine the advertised Grand Prize estimate in the Powerball® game; two important ones are games sales and the annuity factor .  A number of variables can affect game sales, such as seasonality or a big Mega Millions jackpot. Traditionally, game sales are stronger for a Saturday drawing versus a Wednesday drawing.  The annuity factor, or the cost to fund an annuity prize, is another key component. The annuity factor is made up of interest rates for securities purchased to fund prize payments. The higher the interest rates, the higher the advertised Grand Prize. You might not realize that an economic reality like interest rates impact even the Powerball jackpot, but they do!    Are you sure your odds are right? Most players think the odds of matching the Powerball to win a prize are 1 in 26, since the Powerball is drawn from a field of numbers from 1 to 26.  But consider this…  The odds of matching the Powerball ALONE are harder than 1 in 26, because there is also the chance you could match one or more white balls, in addition to the Powerball, to win another prize.  Powerball numbers are drawn from two sets of numbers, so the odds of winning a prize are calculated by combining the odds for both sets of numbers for all prize levels. The odds for matching just the Powerball are calculated by combining the odds of selecting the Powerball and the odds of not selecting any of the five numbers from the first set of numbers drawn.    How late can I purchase Powerball tickets? Sales cut-off times vary by one to two hours before the drawings on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, depending on the selling jurisdiction.    Can I purchase Powerball tickets over the Internet? Some lotteries sell Powerball® tickets over the Internet, but the service is only available to residents of that jurisdiction. The sale of Powerball tickets over the Internet or by mail across jurisdictional borders is restricted. Lotteries may refuse to pay out prize money on Powerball tickets purchased on any website other than their own. Please contact your lottery with any further questions.    Do you have to be a U.S. citizen or resident to play Powerball? You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident to play Powerball®. Players from jurisdictions where Powerball tickets are not sold, either in the United States or outside the country, can purchase Powerball tickets from a retailer licensed or authorized by the selling jurisdiction, if they meet the legal age requirement in the jurisdiction of purchase. Federal and jurisdictional income taxes may apply to any claimed prize money.    When is the 10X multiplier in play? The 10X multiplier is only in play when the advertised jackpot annuity is $150 million or less.    Do I have to match the numbers in the exact order drawn? Powerball® tickets print the white ball numbers in numerical order of a given play. You can match the white ball numbers in any order of a given play to win a prize. The red Powerball number of a given play on your ticket must match the red Powerball drawn. Each play on a ticket is separately determined; players cannot crisscross play lines on a ticket or combine numbers from other tickets.    How can I claim my prize? Prizes must be claimed in the jurisdiction where the winning ticket was purchased. Players can generally claim a prize up to $600 at any licensed lottery retailer in the jurisdiction where they bought the ticket. Prizes over $600 can be claimed at some lottery offices, depending on the amount, and also at lottery headquarters. Please contact your lottery with any further questions.    How long do I have to claim my prize? Ticket expiration dates vary from 90 days to one year, depending on the selling jurisdiction. The expiration date is often listed on the back of your ticket. If the expiration date is not listed, check with your lottery.    What happens to unclaimed prizes? Unclaimed prizes are kept by the lottery jurisdiction. If a Grand Prize goes unclaimed, the money must be returned to all lotteries in proportion to their sales for the draw run. The lotteries then distribute the money, based on their own jurisdiction's laws, to other lottery games or to their jurisdiction's general fund, or otherwise as required by law.    Can Powerball winners remain anonymous? Every jurisdiction has its own law on winners remaining anonymous. Some jurisdictions are required by law to provide the winner's name, city of residence, game won and prize amount to any third party that requests the information. Other jurisdictions allow winners to create trusts to shield their names from the public, or otherwise claim prizes anonymously. Check with your lottery to see if taking a photo of the winner is required and what its rules are on prize claims. Even if you keep your identity secret from the media and the public, you will have to be known to the lottery so officials can confirm you are eligible to play and win, as well as other legal requirements.    What is the difference between the annuity and cash value option? A Powerball jackpot winner may choose to receive their prize in 30 payments over 29 years or a lump-sum payment. The cash value option, in general, is the amount of money required to be in the jackpot prize pool, on the day of the drawing, to fund the estimated jackpot annuity prize. The advertised jackpot annuity and cash value are estimates until ticket sales are final, and for the annuity, until the Multi-State Lottery Association takes bids on the purchase of securities.  Federal and jurisdictional income taxes apply to both jackpot prize options.  Check with your lottery for its rules on how to claim a jackpot prize and the correct procedure for selecting the annuity or cash value option.     What happens to an annuitized prize if the winner dies? If a jackpot winner dies before receiving all annual installments, the balance of the prize will be paid to the winner's estate. Upon receipt of a court order, annual prize payments will continue to be paid to the winner's heirs. Other provisions may also apply depending on the laws of the lottery paying the prize.    I got an email asking me to send money to collect a Powerball prize. Is it legitimate? Lotteries will never contact you via email or telephone call to inform you that you’ve won a prize, unless you specifically entered an official lottery promotion or contest.  In addition, lotteries will never ask you to pay a fee to collect a Powerball prize. If you are asked to pay a fee to claim a prize, you are likely being scammed, and you should not share any personal or banking information with those entities.    Is Powerball giving away prize money on Facebook? In the past, Facebook users have reported notices that indicate Powerball is giving away prize money on Facebook. These notices are false and fraudulent. Lotteries do not contact prize winners through Facebook, unless you specifically entered an official lottery promotion or contest.    What's the math behind the How Tall is $40 million feature? A United States $100 bill is .0043 inches thick.  Ten thousand $100 bills equals $1 million (10,000 x $100 = $1,000,000).  Therefore, a $1 million stack of $100 bills is 43 inches tall (10,000 x .0043 inches = 43 inches).  43 inches = 3.5833 feet  A stack of one hundred dollar bills equaling $40,000,000 is 143.33 feet tall (40 x 3.5833 feet = 143.33 feet).                  ×   Search Result           Keep Up With the Winning Numbers in Powerball!

          Updated Dec 29, 2017 2:14 PM EST   'Tis the season to start dreaming: Prizes for the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries have climbed past $300 million , with drawings set for Friday and Saturday. But don't quit your day job just yet. The odds of winning one of the jackpots is roughly one in 259 million for Mega Millions and one in 292 million for Powerball. And the chances of winning both, for those of you thinking really big? Roughly one in 75 quadrillion -- that's 15 zeros -- according to data scientists at Allstate. To understand how unlikely those odds are, it's worth comparing them to the probability of other unlikely events. Americans are much more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of one in 13,500) or to die in a car accident (one in 645). While the old lottery campaign "You've got to be in it to win it" holds true, the real value in buying a ticket may simply be to enjoy the dream of winning.     The Powerball website announced Thursday that no winning tickets had been sold. The estimated top prize for the next drawing on Saturday night is $384 million, or a cash prize of $242.9 million. The estimated Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million (or a cash option of $191 million), with the next drawing set for Friday at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets cost $2. Sales time cut-offs vary by state but are usually one to two hours before the drawing. The average American spends about $200 a year on lottery tickets , though residents of some states spend far more. According to a study by LendEDU, the average Massachusetts resident spends $735 annually on lottery tickets . Rhode Islanders plop down $514 a year. And if you live in Delaware or New York, you're likely spending about $400 a year, or $33 per month (see map below). The odds of winning "scratchers" -- those little instant winning tickets that you can buy for prices ranging from $1 to $50 -- are better, but it's still no way to get rich. LendEDU experimented with determining "a return on investment" with scratchers by buying $1,000 worth of tickets. The good news: The site won with 68 of the 314 tickets -- indicating that you have a near 22 percent chance of a positive return with lottery scratchers. And, in fact, a big win ($500) on a $20 ticket helped the lending site recover the bulk of its investment. The bad news: Like most players, LendEDU lost money in the end, recovering just $974 of its $1,000. That amounts to an average return on investment of -2.6 percent. So who does make out in lottery sales? Convenience stores. Big jackpots tend to bring customers into gas stations and convenience stores, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores. Its members sell about two-thirds of all lottery tickets in the U.S. The giant Powerball and Mega Million jackpots are feeding on each other, with customers coming into stores to buy a ticket for one and noticing the other jackpot, he said.     "The key thing for awareness is really, once you go into the store to buy one, there's that screen that shows that there's another big jackpot," Lenard said. "It's that digital signage inside the store that's driving that double interest." Convenience stores make about a dime on a $2 ticket, or about 5 percent to 6 percent on each dollar spent. Winning stores also earn a commission, although the amount varies by state. Following are the odds of winning the jackpots, as calculated by Allstate, along with the chances of other unlikely events: Being a victim of identity theft by the age of 40 : 1 in 6 Getting bitten by a dog while out for a jog : 1 in 133 Getting a hole in one on your birthday : 1 in 25,000 Having all of the above happen to one person : 1 in 19,900,000 Winning Powerball: 1 in 292,201,338 Winning Mega Millions : 1 in 258,890,850 Winning both Powerball and Mega Millions : 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

There was no winner of the jackpot in the most recent drawing on Jan. 3. And while the big prize isn’t quite as big as it was last August (when it topped $750 million), that’s not stopping people from dreaming of what could be. But even the most optimistic players realize they’re probably not going to win it all.  As of Wednesday morning, the odds of winning the lottery stood at one in 292.2 million. How does that compare to other unlikely events? Short answer, it’s not good news…  To put things in context, consider this: The 1980 U.S. Men’s hockey team victory over the U.S.S.R—the “Miracle on Ice”—only had odds of 1,000 to one. But it gets much worse from there.      For instance, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, your odds of being struck by lightning this year are 1 in 1,083,000 – and, over the course of your lifetime, those drop to about 1 in 13,500.  Speaking of things falling from the sky, you’ve got a one in 1,600,000 chance of dying from a local meteorite , asteroid, or comet impact, according to a 2014 paper by Tulane University earth sciences professor Stephen A. Nelson.  The odds of being killed by a shark are 1 in 3,748,067. And that’s nothing compared to your odds of dying in a Grand Canyon flash flood, which stand at 1 in 14,270,000, according to The Book of Odds.  And even if you really show up the oddsmakers and make three consecutive holes in one the next time you hit the links, it still won’t put you close to your chances of winning Powerball. Your chances of such a successful day on the Greens currently stand at ‘just’ 156,250,000 to 1.

The odds that you'll win the $445 million jackpot in Friday's Mega Millions drawing are really, really bad.  And the odds that you'll win $550 million in the Powerball drawing Saturday are similarly stacked against you.    The likelihood of winning both? Forget about it.  The Mega Millions odds are 1 in 302.6 million. That's more than 2,000 times less likely than being killed by a lightening strike or an earthquake.   Related: Powerball jackpot grows to $550 million    The odds of winning Powerball are only slightly better -- 1 in 292.2 million.  If it seems like the odds are even worse than they used to be, they are.  Both games have increased the choice of numbers people can play, which makes it less likely that someone will get all six numbers right. Powerball lengthened its odds in late 2015, while Mega Millions made the change this past October.  Having jackpot winners less frequently means that the top prizes roll over more and get bigger. And that attracts even more players. Right now that cycle is working perfectly.  In fact, this is the first time ever that both games have offered jackpots of $400 million or more at the same time.  And that's prompting people to buy tickets to both games, rather than just one or the other.   Related: What tax reform means for the next big lottery winner   So that raises the question, what are the chance of winning both games this week and walking away with jackpots totaling nearly $1 billion?  That would be 1 in 88 quadrillion, or 1 in 88,412,922,115,183,000 to be precise. If quadrillion isn't a term you deal with very often, think of it this way -- it's 88,000 trillion, or 88 million billion.  Or if you're one of those people who do better with percentages: You have a 0.0000000000000011% chance of winning both games.

The estimated jackpot for the next Mega Millions drawing , on Tuesday, January 2, is $343 million, while the Powerball jackpot scheduled for Wednesday is up to a whopping $440 million.  There have been much higher multi-state lottery jackpots in recent history: In early 2016, for instance, the Powerball grand prize hit a mind-blowing $1.5 billion , and last August, a woman from Massachusetts won the biggest individual Powerball prize ever, worth nearly $760 million before taxes. At one point in late 2013, the Mega Millions jackpot hit $550 million .  According to CNBC , however, this week marks only the second time in history that both the Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots surpassed $300 million at the same time.      Such an event probably won’t be much of a rarity going forward, though, thanks to changes to both lottery games that push jackpots ever higher—while simultaneously decreasing the odds of winning.  Powerball’s new rules went into effect in the fall of 2015, when the set of numbers players choose from increased from 59 to 69 . The takeaway was that the odds of winning, which had previously been 1 in 175 million, became even less likely, at roughly 1 in 292 million.  The upside for Powerball players is that as fewer people have been hitting the jackpot, the grand prizes keep rolling over and keep getting bigger. Hence the epic Powerball jackpots we saw last summer and in early 2016 . And hence the increased excitement and rising Powerball ticket sales nationally whenever the jackpots head into the stratosphere.     More recent changes to Mega Millions were also instituted with the idea that they would push jackpots higher. Starting in October 2017, the price of a Mega Millions ticket doubled from $1 to $2, and the game was redesigned in terms of the number of balls players can choose from. As a result, the odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot became worse overnight, going from roughly 1 in 259 million to 1 in 303 million.  More people will be playing Mega Millions anyway. Why? The redesigned game also increased the opening Mega Millions jackpot, from $15 million to $40 million. What’s more, similarly to Powerball, the jackpots have been growing exponentially quicker and larger—because players are paying more for tickets, and because as fewer people win the grand prize soars higher and higher.      The way things are going, it won’t be all that unusual in the future for both Mega Millions and Powerball to have jackpots over $300 million, or even $500 million. And if the jackpots for both hit $1 billion at the same time, you can expect lottery hysteria—and sales of Mega Millions and Powerball tickets—to ratchet up to levels no one’s ever seen.

By Sarah Begley  August 23, 2017       People have been snapping up Powerball tickets around the country in hopes of winning the second-biggest jackpot of all time: $700 million. But the odds of winning Wednesday night’s drawing are remote — about one in 292 million.  Until a rule change in 2015, the odds were more favorable at one in 175 million.  The difference is that the total number of balls to pick from increased from 59 to 69, with players picking five, the Washington Post reports . The new odds are roughly akin to one person being randomly selected among the entire U.S. population of 323 million.   Still, for many, the long odds are worth the $2 risk — and if no one wins Wednesday night’s drawing, the jackpot will likely swell above the previous record of $1.6 billion.

Kevin Breuninger | @KevinWilliamB   Published  1:12  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  Updated   1:42  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018  CNBC.com                show chapters               U.S. lottery players now have two chances at jackpots of more than $300 million   4:30  PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:37       If your retirement plan involves winning either of this weekend's multi-million dollar lottery jackpots, sorry — you're far more likely to be killed by a falling asteroid.   The combined Powerball and the Mega Millions jackpots are the largest ever , at more than $1 billion. The Powerball jackpot is currently $570 million, and the Mega Millions stands at $450 million. Both games had their most recent jackpot wins in late October.  The next Mega Millions drawing is scheduled for 11 p.m. ET on Friday, and the next Powerball drawing is Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.   Two lottery drawings does technically imply more opportunities to win — but really, you should check your hopes at the convenience store counter.  The odds of winning the Powerball grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to the game's own assessment . The Mega Millions jackpot odds are even more hopeless, at 1 in 302.5 million.  (In late October, Mega Millions changed its range of numbers players can choose from, which made the odds of winning the big jackpot slimmer. Before that change, its jackpot odds were 1 in 258.9 million.)  A few points of comparison. Your odds of being struck dead by a stray asteroid are just 1 in 1.9 million, according to Jim Murphy at sportsbettingexperts.com . The odds of being killed by a shark are even less likely at 1 in 3.7 million.       Getty Images   Yet both of these improbabilities are exponentially more likely than winning the whole bonanza in either of this weekend's lottery drawings.  And perish the thought of winning both the Mega Millions and the Powerball. An Allstate analysis from mid-2017 (before the Mega Millions top prize odds worsened) put the chance of a double-win at 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300. (That's 75 quadrillion.)  For those lucky few who do win the lottery, be prepared to sacrifice a hefty chunk of your winnings in tax payments almost immediately.  Lottery site USAMega.com estimates the federal tax withholding on the $281.2 million Mega Millions lump sum would be $70.3 million, and state taxes could knock out up to another $24.8 million (with New York the worst offender). For the Powerball, those tax tallies for the $358.5 million cash prize would be $89.6 million and up to $31.6 million, respectively.

Just kidding, that's Jenny's number . Not to say that would be the worst choice. Your odds of winning this week’s record Powerball jackpot with Jenny's help, or any other combination of numbers, are pretty bad. How bad? Like one in more than 292 million bad. Or put another way, barely better odds than having your name randomly pulled from a hat filled with the names of everyone in the US. But you're an optimist, right? I say that and you figure I'm telling you there's a chance . And behind every game of chance is some fascinating math. Powerball is like normal lottery with a twist. You pick five numbers—ranging from one through 69—which pop up as white balls in the eventual drawing. A final, yellow Powerball only ranges from one to 26, but always comes last. The one-in-292-million odds come from all the different combinations you can win by picking the right five white balls—in any order—out of a drum of 69. "Multiplied by 26, because for every five-ball combination you've got 26 different associated Powerballs," says University of Buffalo statistician Jeffrey Miecznikowski . And for the jackpot, those odds never change. Your odds of winning tomorrow's $1.4 billion (and counting) jackpot are exactly the same as they were of winning in November, when the pot was a mere $40 million.

Now Here's What You Do: Nothing Sarah Mitroff Being Filthy Rich Doesn't Buy Happiness, But Raises Do Which means—at the very least—you’re better off buying a ticket now than you were then. This gets into something statisticians call “expected return." Simply put, this is your odds of winning multiplied by the potential payout. If the odds were perfect, and you could never lose, then the expected return would be $40 million: a fantastic investment. If you buy one Powerball ticket, giving you a one in 292 million chance of winning $1.4 billion, your expected return is almost $5 on that $2 ticket—a great investment. But wait: Powerball's expected return is actually way, way lower than that. How low? First off, you only get $1.4 billion if you accept the payout over 30 years. If you want it all at once, your bounty drops to $868 million. Then you gotta pay taxes. I’m going to assume you’re not already rich, and therefore do not have a cabal of Randian lawyers standing between your money and the government. Which means you're losing about 40 percent at the federal tax rate. Oh and also, the IRS withholds an extra 25 to 28 percent because you struck it rich gambling. If you’re lucky enough to live somewhere without state taxes, you take home around $524 million. Otherwise, your pot could be as "little" as $394 million—but multiplied by 1/292,000,000, your expected return on a $2 ticket is about $1.79 at the high end, and $1.35 at the low. That's all back-of-the-napkin math, but the answer tells you what you need to know: If your expected return is less than your investment, put your money towards something else. Now, that expected return will get better as long as the jackpot keeps growing. Unless game goes on too long. "The higher the jackpot, the more people you can expect to play, so that $1.4 billion jackpot is more likely to get split in multiple ways," says Miecznikowski. Exactly how much those odds change is difficult to figure out, because you'd have to know exactly how many Powerball tickets have been sold. For obvious reasons, the Multi-State Lottery Association keeps that number under wraps. You could estimate based on the jackpot size. This week's $1.4 billion is $450 million higher than Saturday's prize. The jackpot is about 32.5 percent of the base buy-in rate, plus whatever was leftover from last time. At face value, that would mean more than 146 million people have bought tickets. However, that doesn’t account for people paying extra money for multipliers should they win. And of course, these calculations don’t take human fallibility into account. "Not all combinations are equally likely to be chosen by people," says Miecznikowski. For instance, people who choose their own numbers often use birth dates. This is fine when you are choosing the yellow Powerball, which only goes up to 26, but white balls go up to 69. That leaves 32 through 69 underrepresented. "And on Saturday, the Powerball number was 13. Superstitious folks are less likely to choose that," says Miecznikowski. Your best bet, he adds, is to let the computer choose your numbers. By the way, these long odds are by design. In October 2015, the non-profit organization controlling Powerball changed the format, increasing the range of white balls from 59 to 69, while lowering the range of Powerballs from 35 to 26. The odds dropped from one in 175 million to one in 292 million. This simultaneously did two things: made it easier to win low-stakes payouts (guessing just the Powerball nets you $4), and much, much harder to win the jackpot. This incentivizes more people to play, and makes the game harder to win. "By making the odds more difficult, it guaranteed record jackpots because it is rolling over every time," says Miecznikowski. "The publicity that Powerball has gotten setting record jackpots has really fueled popularity of the game." In other words, you're playing against a bigger and bigger crowd. But hey, may the odds be ever in your favor. #math #money #statistics Most Popular gear 4 Best Smartphones of 2018: Guide to Android, Samsung Galaxy, iPhone Author: Jeffrey Van Camp Jeffrey Van Camp gear How to Check If Cambridge Analytica Could Access Your Facebook Data Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett culture 'Far Cry 5' Review: All Games Are Illusions, But This Is Nothing More Author: Julie Muncy Julie Muncy More Stories View Comments Sponsored Stories Powered By Outbrain Megan Molteni With Some Structure, Stem Cells Might Still Stop Vision Loss Adam Rogers Too Much Engineering Has Made Mississippi River Floods Worse Sarah Scoles The Woman Who Knows Everything About the Universe Stephen Wolfram *2001: A Space Odyssey* Predicted the Future—50 Years Ago Matt Simon Why These Bumblebees Are Wearing Itty-Bitty QR Codes More science Math What Random Walks in Multiple Dimensions Teach You About Life Author: Rhett Allain Rhett Allain Genetics Helix Takes Clinical Genetic Testing Straight to Consumers Author: Megan Molteni Megan Molteni NASA Inside the Cleanroom Where the Mars Lander Preps for Launch Author: Matt Simon Matt Simon Thought Experiments New Brain Maps With Unmatched Detail May Change Neuroscience Author: Monique Brouillette Monique Brouillette gallery The Case of the Missing Dark Matter Author: Shannon Stirone Shannon Stirone Math Why Winning in Rock-Paper-Scissors Isn’t Everything Author: Patrick Honner Patrick Honner We Recommend Powered By Outbrain Adam Rogers A Month's Worth of Rain Will Hit California This Weekend Robbie Gonzalez A Brain-Boosting Prosthesis Moves From Rats to Humans Eric Niiler From AI to Russia, Here’s How Estonia’s President Is Planning for the Future Rhett Allain Do You Weigh More at the Equator or at the North Pole?

It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money .  Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59  p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play. [1] Each play costs $2, or $3 with the Power Play option. (Originally, Powerball plays cost $1; when PowerPlay began, such games were $2.) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00  p.m. Eastern Time; some lotteries cut off sales earlier. [2] The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery ’s studio in Tallahassee .  On January 13, 2016, Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills, California , [3] [4] in Munford, Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach, Florida .

In 2013, Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery; the next year, it began, initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball.  History [ edit ]  1988 precursor: Lotto America [ edit ]  Powerball's predecessor began in 1988; [6] the multi-state game was known as Lotto America . The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.  Powerball begins [ edit ]  When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by The Big Game (now Mega Millions ) in the US, Australia's Powerball , Thunderball in the UK , Eurojackpot and EuroMillions (unlike most two-drum games, Euromillions selects two numbers called "Lucky Stars" from the 2nd drum; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches).  Through 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines, Iowa . The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace , who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went "on the road" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new The Big Game , then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.  On November 2, 1997, the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added. [7] The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.  In 1998, Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.  On March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called Power Play ) was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel.)  2009: Florida became host to drawings [ edit ]  With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.  Based on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.  The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando . The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a random number generator (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.  Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009, [8] the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010; it joined Mega Millions (along with New York) years earlier, when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name.  2010 cross-sell expansion [ edit ]  In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On Oct 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. [9] In Nov, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online. [10] [11]  On Jan 31, 2010, the date of the cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May. The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1. Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20; Oregon followed on March 28; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16. The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010.  Before the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the Sharon, Pennsylvania / Masury, Ohio border sold both Mega Millions (via the Ohio Lottery ) and Powerball ( Pennsylvania ) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries. [12]  Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation  WGN-TV through its national WGN America feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox owned-and-operated station  WFLD in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.  On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in Morris Plains . On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).  On June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.  2012 format change [ edit ]  On January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million. [13] A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million. The red balls decreased from 39 to 35. [14] The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery’s studios in Tallahassee. Sam Arlen served as host, with Alexa Fuentes substituting.  These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine-figure jackpots; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible (it became a reality within the year, [15] ) and that the 1st $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 [16] Less than three months after the Powerball changes, Mega Millions' jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1-per-play game. [17] The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set, fixed dollar amount payout. [18] The $25 million rollover "cap" (creating larger 5+0 prizes) was eliminated.  California joined on April 8, 2013; it has never offered the Power Play option, as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games, by law, are parimutuel . Mega Millions, which became available in California in 2005, offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions.  On January 22, 2014, the variable Power Play option returned (2x-5x) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes. [18]  In October 2014, Puerto Rico joined Powerball; the first mainly Spanish-speaking jurisdiction offering the game; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions.  2015 format change [ edit ]  On Oct 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338. [19] The 4+1 prize became $50,000; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million. [20] Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers. [19] [21]  Playing the game [ edit ]  Basic game [ edit ]  The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called "quick pick", "easy pick", etc.).  In each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.  Two identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey . There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display.

[20]  While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75 + 1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.  Power Play [ edit ]  For an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.  The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.  Power Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5× spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10×. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10× multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10× space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10× multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10× multiplier was not drawn until June 12. The second prize 5× guarantee continued; the 10× applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.  Power Play′s success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably Megaplier , available through all Mega Millions members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having "fixed" Power Play prizes.

Only a "lottery" was authorized by the state Lottery Act. Therefore, Power Play is not offered in California.  ^ a  b  $2,000,000 fixed for match 5+0 with Power Play as of 2012 format change.  ^ a  b  Power Play multipliers do not apply to jackpot. Jackpot is split among multiple winners.     § Odds of winning 0+1 prize are 1:38.32 instead of 1:26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball . [26]  All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts (except in California); they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis, with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier, if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member. [27]  Jackpot accumulation and payment options [ edit ]  Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash (in two installments; one from the winning jurisdiction, then the combined funds from the other members) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments. Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation. [28]  The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. [2] The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non- Power Play ) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.  MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used. [2]  When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.  Claiming prizes [ edit ]  A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19); and Arizona, Iowa, and Louisiana (21).  Generally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose.) Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60-day " clock " starts with the drawing, so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. New Jersey and Texas require the cash/annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding (when the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.  Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only. There is no state income tax in Florida , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming , and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire . Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)  Secondary prizes [ edit ]  Unlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.  Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables. [29] Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.  Notable wins [ edit ]  Main article: Lottery jackpot records § United States  Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids. [30]  On August 23, 2017, the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee, Massachusetts won more than $750 million, one of the largest prizes in the lottery's history. [31]  On January 13, 2016, the world's largest lottery jackpot, an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion, was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills, California , Melbourne Beach, Florida and Munford, Tennessee , each worth $528.8 million. Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee (and California does not tax lottery winnings), the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each. [32]  On May 18, 2013, the world's largest one-ticket jackpot, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($620 million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida . [33] On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner: Gloria C. MacKenzie, 84, who purchased the "quick pick" ticket at a Publix supermarket. [34] MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding; Florida does not have a state income tax. [34]  Other winners in excess of $250 million: On December 25, 2002, Jack Whittaker , president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia , won $314.9 million ($428 million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings. [35]  On October 19, 2005, the West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million ($426 million today). [36] The Wests chose the cash payout of $164.4 million (before withholdings), smaller than Whittaker's cash payout in 2002 due to a then-recent change in the annuity structure.  A jackpot of $365 million ($443 million today) was won on February 18, 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska . It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant. [37] The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million, before withholdings.  On August 25, 2007, a jackpot worth $314 million ($371 million today) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond, Indiana , a community that had previously sold a jackpot-winning ticket of over $200 million. [38]  In November 2011, three Greenwich, Connecticut , financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ($277 million today), the largest prize on a Connecticut-bought ticket. Choosing the cash option, the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings. The jackpot, at the time, was the 12th largest in Powerball history. [39]  Fortune cookie payout [ edit ]  The Powerball drawing on March 30, 2005, produced 110 second-prize winners. The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million, with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each, while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections.  MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error. However, all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City, New York . The factory had printed the numbers "22, 28, 32, 33, 39, 40" on thousands of fortunes. The "40" in the fortune did not match the Powerball number, 42. None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers; at the time, the closest game member was Connecticut . [40] Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play, the payouts were made. [41]  Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number, these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot: each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash (before withholdings). [42] The fortune on the cookie read: "All the preparation you've done will finally be paying off." [40]  Computers and slot machines [ edit ]  In 2006, WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name. In 2007, the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real-time. The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements.  The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010. Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card, with 12 opportunities to match. Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won. The top prize was $1 million (annuity); unlike actual Powerball, there was no cash option for the top prize.

The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot. Now, when the Powerball Lottery jackpot is reset after a win it will start at $40 million, tempting even more players in for those early draws. Another promise, that is sure to be popular with lottery players, is the introduction of more prizes. From January, Powerball players will have even better odds of winning a prize worth at least $1 million, and it’s that fact that may soften the third and biggest ever change. From January 15, 2012, Powerball Lottery tickets are doubling in price, in what is the biggest change to the Powerball Lottery draw since its launch in 1994.   ^  Lokay, Jim.

It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money .  Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59  p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play. [1] Each play costs $2, or $3 with the Power Play option. (Originally, Powerball plays cost $1; when PowerPlay began, such games were $2.) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00  p.m. Eastern Time; some lotteries cut off sales earlier. [2] The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery ’s studio in Tallahassee .  On January 13, 2016, Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills, California , [3] [4] in Munford, Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach, Florida .

In 2013, Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery; the next year, it began, initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball.  History [ edit ]  1988 precursor: Lotto America [ edit ]  Powerball's predecessor began in 1988; [6] the multi-state game was known as Lotto America . The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.  Powerball begins [ edit ]  When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by The Big Game (now Mega Millions ) in the US, Australia's Powerball , Thunderball in the UK , Eurojackpot and EuroMillions (unlike most two-drum games, Euromillions selects two numbers called "Lucky Stars" from the 2nd drum; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches).  Through 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines, Iowa . The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace , who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went "on the road" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new The Big Game , then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.  On November 2, 1997, the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added. [7] The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.  In 1998, Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.  On March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called Power Play ) was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel.)  2009: Florida became host to drawings [ edit ]  With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.  Based on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.  The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando . The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a random number generator (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.  Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009, [8] the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010; it joined Mega Millions (along with New York) years earlier, when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name.  2010 cross-sell expansion [ edit ]  In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On Oct 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. [9] In Nov, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online. [10] [11]  On Jan 31, 2010, the date of the cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May. The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1. Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20; Oregon followed on March 28; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16. The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010.  Before the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the Sharon, Pennsylvania / Masury, Ohio border sold both Mega Millions (via the Ohio Lottery ) and Powerball ( Pennsylvania ) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries. [12]  Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation  WGN-TV through its national WGN America feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox owned-and-operated station  WFLD in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.  On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in Morris Plains . On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).  On June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.  2012 format change [ edit ]  On January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million. [13] A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million. The red balls decreased from 39 to 35. [14] The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery’s studios in Tallahassee. Sam Arlen served as host, with Alexa Fuentes substituting.  These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine-figure jackpots; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible (it became a reality within the year, [15] ) and that the 1st $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 [16] Less than three months after the Powerball changes, Mega Millions' jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1-per-play game. [17] The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set, fixed dollar amount payout. [18] The $25 million rollover "cap" (creating larger 5+0 prizes) was eliminated.  California joined on April 8, 2013; it has never offered the Power Play option, as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games, by law, are parimutuel . Mega Millions, which became available in California in 2005, offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions.  On January 22, 2014, the variable Power Play option returned (2x-5x) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes. [18]  In October 2014, Puerto Rico joined Powerball; the first mainly Spanish-speaking jurisdiction offering the game; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions.  2015 format change [ edit ]  On Oct 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338. [19] The 4+1 prize became $50,000; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million. [20] Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers. [19] [21]  Playing the game [ edit ]  Basic game [ edit ]  The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called "quick pick", "easy pick", etc.).  In each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.  Two identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey . There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display.

[20]  While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75 + 1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.  Power Play [ edit ]  For an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.  The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.  Power Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5× spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10×. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10× multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10× space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10× multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10× multiplier was not drawn until June 12. The second prize 5× guarantee continued; the 10× applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.  Power Play′s success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably Megaplier , available through all Mega Millions members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having "fixed" Power Play prizes.

Only a "lottery" was authorized by the state Lottery Act. Therefore, Power Play is not offered in California.  ^ a  b  $2,000,000 fixed for match 5+0 with Power Play as of 2012 format change.  ^ a  b  Power Play multipliers do not apply to jackpot. Jackpot is split among multiple winners.     § Odds of winning 0+1 prize are 1:38.32 instead of 1:26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball . [26]  All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts (except in California); they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis, with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier, if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member. [27]  Jackpot accumulation and payment options [ edit ]  Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash (in two installments; one from the winning jurisdiction, then the combined funds from the other members) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments. Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation. [28]  The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. [2] The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non- Power Play ) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.  MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used. [2]  When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.  Claiming prizes [ edit ]  A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19); and Arizona, Iowa, and Louisiana (21).  Generally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose.) Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60-day " clock " starts with the drawing, so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. New Jersey and Texas require the cash/annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding (when the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.  Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only. There is no state income tax in Florida , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming , and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire . Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)  Secondary prizes [ edit ]  Unlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.  Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables. [29] Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.  Notable wins [ edit ]  Main article: Lottery jackpot records § United States  Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids. [30]  On August 23, 2017, the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee, Massachusetts won more than $750 million, one of the largest prizes in the lottery's history. [31]  On January 13, 2016, the world's largest lottery jackpot, an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion, was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills, California , Melbourne Beach, Florida and Munford, Tennessee , each worth $528.8 million. Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee (and California does not tax lottery winnings), the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each. [32]  On May 18, 2013, the world's largest one-ticket jackpot, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($620 million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida . [33] On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner: Gloria C. MacKenzie, 84, who purchased the "quick pick" ticket at a Publix supermarket. [34] MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding; Florida does not have a state income tax. [34]  Other winners in excess of $250 million: On December 25, 2002, Jack Whittaker , president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia , won $314.9 million ($428 million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings. [35]  On October 19, 2005, the West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million ($426 million today). [36] The Wests chose the cash payout of $164.4 million (before withholdings), smaller than Whittaker's cash payout in 2002 due to a then-recent change in the annuity structure.  A jackpot of $365 million ($443 million today) was won on February 18, 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska . It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant. [37] The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million, before withholdings.  On August 25, 2007, a jackpot worth $314 million ($371 million today) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond, Indiana , a community that had previously sold a jackpot-winning ticket of over $200 million. [38]  In November 2011, three Greenwich, Connecticut , financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ($277 million today), the largest prize on a Connecticut-bought ticket. Choosing the cash option, the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings. The jackpot, at the time, was the 12th largest in Powerball history. [39]  Fortune cookie payout [ edit ]  The Powerball drawing on March 30, 2005, produced 110 second-prize winners. The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million, with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each, while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections.  MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error. However, all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City, New York . The factory had printed the numbers "22, 28, 32, 33, 39, 40" on thousands of fortunes. The "40" in the fortune did not match the Powerball number, 42. None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers; at the time, the closest game member was Connecticut . [40] Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play, the payouts were made. [41]  Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number, these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot: each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash (before withholdings). [42] The fortune on the cookie read: "All the preparation you've done will finally be paying off." [40]  Computers and slot machines [ edit ]  In 2006, WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name. In 2007, the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real-time. The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements.  The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010. Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card, with 12 opportunities to match. Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won. The top prize was $1 million (annuity); unlike actual Powerball, there was no cash option for the top prize.

The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot. Now, when the Powerball Lottery jackpot is reset after a win it will start at $40 million, tempting even more players in for those early draws. Another promise, that is sure to be popular with lottery players, is the introduction of more prizes. From January, Powerball players will have even better odds of winning a prize worth at least $1 million, and it’s that fact that may soften the third and biggest ever change. From January 15, 2012, Powerball Lottery tickets are doubling in price, in what is the biggest change to the Powerball Lottery draw since its launch in 1994.   ^  Lokay, Jim.

FILE - In this July 1, 2016, file photo, Mega Millions lottery tickets rest on a counter at a Pilot travel center near Burlington, N.C.  (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File)      You might want to purchase some Powerball or Mega Millions tickets today.  Both lottery games have jackpots over $300 million each. Currently, the Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million, and Powerball is at $384 million.  This is the second time ever that U.S. lottery players are presented with two chances to try for jackpots that exceed $300 million at the same time, according to CNBC .  Early August of 2017 marked the first time that both prizes reached over $300 million. Lucky winner Patricia Busking of Illinois took home $393 million in Mega Millions winnings. And after Powerball climbed to $758.7 million in late August, Mavis Wanczyk claimed the prize.    From now until the end of the year, there are two drawings left. The last Mega Millions drawing of 2017 will be on Friday at 11 p.m. ET. The final Powerball drawing of the year will be on Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.  So with two prizes exceeding $300 million, you now have double the chances of winning a huge jackpot. But which tickets might you want to buy more of?  Well, back in October of this year, when Mega Millions doubled its ticket price from $1 to $2, it also changed its range of numbers that players have to choose from ( more details here ). This change made the odds of winning $1 million or more slightly higher, but the chances of winning the full jackpot got longer, according to CNNMoney . This changed the odds from 1 in 258.9 million to 1 in 302.6 million.   In fact, Mega Millions odds are now tougher than Powerball, which is 1 in 292.2 million.  There's also the popular advice to join a lottery pool to boost your odds of winning. According to an article written by Forbes contributor Panos Mourdoukoutas, you can increase your chances of winning by 100 times by joining a pool where 100 people contribute $10 each.
