Show Caption  Hide Caption            Previous     Next                                 Many people will be visiting a casino this summer, whether on a trip to Vegas, on a cruise ship, or just at a local casino during a "staycation." But before you go, you may want to know which games give you the best chance of winning.  So we went behind the scene at two casinos, and spoke with the game managers, to find out which games give you an edge.   Table Games Your Best Bet  Jay Bean, a Caesar's floor manager, agreed to sit down with us and talk about the games with the best odds.  He said many people don't realize that table games have much better odds than slots. They are intimidated by thoughts of card sharks taking their money, with images of an intense Texas Hold 'Em tournament in their minds, and so they stick with the safe games: the slots. But they are doing themselves a disservice, he said.  Bean's advice? After you've spent some time on the slot machines, move on to the Blackjack table, and start by just observing.   1. Blackjack  Blackjack has the best odds of winning, with a house edge of just 1 percent in most casinos, Bean said. Plus, you are playing against only the dealer, not hooded poker champions.  "Blackjack is one of our easiest games to play," Bean said. "You're just looking for a number that beats the dealer's number without going over 21."  If you're a novice, Bean said to sit down during a less busy time, such as the afternoon, and the dealer will walk you through the game. But the same is not true with poker: You should practice the game with your friends first, at home, Bean said, until you are comfortable with it. Bean said novices are best off passing on the poker tables, where yes, the competition can be tough. You can find out more information about the game of blackjack at the following link:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/ 2. Craps  So from the Blackjack table, he suggests moving on to the dice game Craps, the game with the second best odds, also nearly 50-50.  The Craps table can be a bit intimidating for the beginner with all the boxes on the table, Bean admitted. But it's really not tough, and it has one of your best chances of winning. In the end, all you are really doing is betting on a dice roll. For more information on craps, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/ 3. Roulette  Bean said your next stop should be the Roulette wheel. It's simple, and pays fairly well.  "So you bet on your favorite numbers," Bean said. "The dealer spins, and if your number comes in you win."  If you stick to betting on just Reds or Blacks, you have nearly a 50-50 chance of walking away a winner. If it lands on red when you choose red, you will double your bet, Bean explained.  While it may seem you have an even chance of winning by simply choosing a color, there is one catch that gives the house its edge: the extra green 0 and 00 position on the wheel. It's on all American roulette wheels.  Or, if you feel lucky, play just one number. It's hard to win, but if you do it pays out 36 to 1.  For more information on roulette, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/roulette/ Worst Odds  Your worst odds? The casinos, understandably, did not want to talk about games with poor odds.  So we turned to Forbes Magazine, which in a report about Best Bets at the Casino , said two popular games -- the Wheel of Fortune and the ever-popular slot machines -- have the lowest odds of winning, with a house edge of 10 percent or more.   The Experts Agree  Professor of Analytics Michael Magazine has crunched the numbers, and agreed that blackjack is the best way to go home with money in your pockets. He said if you take a little time to learn the game, you have the best odds of winning.  "You are somewhere between 44 percent to 48 percent in every single hand of winning," he said, noting that no other casino game gives you odds that good.  But Magazine cautioned that he's not promoting gambling, because he said even games with the best odds still favor the house.  "Play it long enough and you will lose. In the long term the house doesn't lose," Magazine said. If You Love The Slots....  Finally, if you really enjoy playing the slots, here is some good information to know, from state casino reports we examined. With slots, the more money you put in per bet, the higher your chance of winning. If you put the max in a penny machine, which is usually around 50 cents, you have much better odds than if you put in 2 cents. In addition, penny slots have the lowest odds, with $1 and $5 slots paying much better.  Always gamble responsibly, and don't waste your money. __________________________ You can learn more about specific odds of slots machines in each state that has casino gambling by visiting the American Casino Guide.

Win It.                   The Best and Worst Bets in the Casinos  Knowing which is which can help make you a winner by Frank Scoblete  This article began innocently enough. My editor, Len Butcher, sent me the following email: “Frank, I need a piece on the top 10 best and worst casino bets for the December Casino Player issue. Deadline is October 16. Thanks, Len.”  This should be a snap, I thought. I can write this in my sleep. I immediately thought of the worst game, Keno, where the house edge is about 25 percent—which means you lose about 25 cents for every dollar you bet at the game. Surely that would be at the top of the list for the worst bets you can make in a casino.  So I started writing, but then it dawned on me that something was amiss. In Keno, playing every game, maybe four games an hour at some casinos, betting one dollar, you lose about a dollar per hour. Now if we take a good bet like mini-baccarat’s “bank” bet (which has a 1.06 percent house edge) and you bet $10 per decision, and play 150 decisions (which is not unheard of), then you’d lose a whopping $15.90.   So which is the worse bet? In terms of the house edge, it’s Keno. But speed-wise, mini-baccarat is worse. Then I realized there’s another consideration. Some games are just not found in a lot of casinos. Some of the worst bets in all of casino history are at Sic Bo—where the house edge can soar into the 40 percent range. Should I count these bets among the worst, even if you might never see a Sic Bo game in your life?  And what about video poker, where there are so many machines that the entire article could be about these games?  To keep things simple, in this article I will use the “house edge” as the primary criteria of judgment, but I will mention the speed of the games as well, to give you a more complete picture. And I will limit my list to games that are found in almost all casinos. There are even worse bets out there, but they’re games that haven’t made it to most casinos (thankfully).  As for video poker, I’m not mentioning it among the “best bets” although some video poker machines can be positive expectation games if played properly, and others have house edges of between one-half and one percent or so. I’m limiting this list to table games; finding and playing the right video poker machines is another story unto itself. And, finally, I’m not going to bother mentioning the various “side bets” you’ll occasionally see at the tables. These bets come in many different forms, but they’re almost always a bad idea. Avoid them.  With that said, here we go—the worst first.  The 10 Worst Bets  1. Keno Yes, this is probably the worst bet you will find in most casinos. The average house edge hovers around 25 percent, which is better than state lotteries, but that’s not saying much. Still, the pace of the game is slow and if you only make one bet per game you won’t lose much money.  2. Any Seven (Craps) This is a one-roll bet that the next number rolled will be a seven. The house edge is a monstrous 16.67 percent. If you make this bet on every roll, even if you only wager a measly dollar, you can lose about $20 per hour!  3. Progressive Slot Machines Yes, those gigantic multi-million dollar jackpots sure are tempting, but progressive games are the very worst machines in the casino—no matter what the denomination is. The house edge ranges from 12 to 17 percent. This means you lose between $12 and $17 for every $100 you wager in the long run. Making the situation even more brutal is the fact that people tend to play these games very fast. How much can a $1 slot player lose on an inter-casino linked progressive? Upwards of almost $400 per hour. Yikes!  4. Tie Bet at Baccarat This bet comes with a house edge of around 14 percent. With traditional baccarat, played in the high roller rooms, the game is relatively slow; at mini-baccarat, however, the speed of the game is very fast. This bet is bad in both games.  5. 2 and 12 (Craps) Snake eyes (2) and boxcars (12) have house edges of 13.89 percent. These are one-roll bets for the unwary and unwise craps player.  6. Whirl or World (Craps) This is a multiple number (2, 3, 7, 11, 12), one-roll bet that has a house edge of 13.33 percent. Steer clear of this one.  7. The Horn (Craps) Another multiple number (2, 3, 11, 12) one-roll bet that comes in with a house edge of 12.5 percent. There is a saying, “See a horn, bet a horn.” The real saying should be, “You have to be an idiot to bet the horn.”  8. 3 and 11; Hard 4 and Hard 10; Any Craps (Craps) Ironically, the 11 has an 11.11 percent house edge, as do the rest of these bets. These bets should hold no interest for you, since making them on each and every roll will cost you $11.11 per $100 wagered.  9. 5-Cent Slot Machines The low denomination, non-progressive slot machines also have high house edges—around 10 to 12 percent—and most people play them fast, causing their losses to add up quickly.  10. Hard 6 and Hard 8 (Craps) At this point we’ve left the double-digit house edges behind us, but these two bets are still pretty bad with a house edge of 9.09 percent. They are not active on every roll, which helps a little.  The 10 Best Bets  1. The Pass, Don’t Pass, Come, Don’t Come with Odds (Craps) Some casinos in America are still offering craps games with 100X, 20X, 10X and 5X odds. Here, the house edge is a small fraction of a percent on these games if you utilize the odds bets. Without odds, the house edge on the above bets is about 1.4 percent—still very good. Also, not every roll impacts you, so that’s a good thing too. Most players will be on about 50 percent of the decisions betting this way.  2. Blackjack Basic Strategy If the game you are playing is a traditional blackjack game with the house paying 3 to 2 for blackjacks, with the dealer standing on soft 17, and with the right to double on any first two cards, split and double after splits, the casino will have about a half percent house edge. That means you lose about 50 cents for every $100 wagered—a very good bet indeed. Blackjack is a moderately fast game, but with such a low house edge you still have a very good shot at winning some money on any given session.  3. The Bank Bet at Baccarat The house edge at this bet is 1.06 percent. Remember that traditional, high-roller room baccarat, where the players deal the cards, is a slow game. Mini-baccarat is a fast game.  4. The Player Bet at Baccarat The house edge on this bet is a mere 1.24 percent. See #3.  5. Blackjack Pays 6 to 5 for Natural (Basic Strategy) This new game is three times worse than traditional blackjack, as it pays only $12 to $10 for a blackjack as opposed to $15 to $10. Usually these games also have the dealers hitting their soft 17s. The house edge on these games is around 1.5 percent, depending on the casino’s rules.  6. Place the 6 or 8 (Craps) This bet must be made in multiples of $6. It pays $7 on a win since the house has a 6 to 5 edge on the bet. The house edge is 1.52 percent and the bet is active on 11 of 36 decisions, which means most of the time you will not have your money acted upon.  7. Spanish 21 (Basic Strategy) In this variation of blackjack, the 10-spot cards are removed but there are all sorts of special awards for premium hands built into the rules. With the proper basic strategy, the house edge is around 1.8 percent, give or take, depending on rules of the casino.  8. Three Card Poker There are two games in one here. The main game of ante and wager has about a 2 percent house edge. The secondary game, called Pair Plus, has about a 2.3 percent house edge. The game is relatively fast, so you might want to sit out some hands every so often.  9. Lay the 4 and 10 (Craps) Here, you are betting that the 7 will appear before the 4 or 10. The house edge is 2.44 percent.  10. Caribbean Stud and Pai Gow Poker Two of the first “carnival” card games are still going strong in casinos. The house edge is about 2.5 percent if you play your hands properly. These are relatively slow games.  So there you have it—the worst bets and the best bets you’ll encounter during your next trip to the casino. Good luck, and play smart.  Frank Scoblete is the #1 best-selling gaming author in America.

Casinos remain a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. You may be planning a vacation at a popular casino destination, or you might hang around at a local casino over the weekend. Before you go, we want to share with you the casino games which give you the best chance of winning. We examined what casino managers and the pro gamblers have divulged about casino games with the best odds of winning, and here is what we found.  Top Casino Games With the Best Odds of Winning  We found that several of the most popular table games give you the best odds of winning. These games may initially seem intimidating, but with a bit of learning, you will find them easy to understand and play. When you are at a casino the next time, start by observing these games. If it is a slow time at one of the tables, talk to the dealers. Often, dealers will be more than willing to walk you through the rules and discuss basic game strategies to improve your odds of winning.  When comparing the house edge of various casino games, we found these four popular games to have the best odds:   Blackjack  Baccarat  Craps  Roulette   The house edge is defined as the ratio of the average loss a player makes to the initial bet amount. For example, if you play Blackjack with basic strategy, over the long run, the house edge is 0.5%. This means for every $10 you bet, you will lose 5 cents over the long run. With Baccarat or Craps, you will lose less than 10 cents for every $10 you bet. With roulette, depending on the game design, you could lose 27 to 53 cents for every $10 you bet.   Blackjack  Blackjack is one of the easiest games to play in a casino and offers you one of the strongest odds of winning. Without a doubt, it is the most popular table game in the United States. The casino has an edge of less than 1 percent in most cases. Additionally, with Blackjack, you are always playing only against the dealer and not against an unassuming expert gambler who could be sitting right next to you.  How to Play Blackjack  In Blackjack, the objective of the game is to beat the dealer. In order to beat the dealer, you need to get cards that get you close to 21, but not over. While not going over 21, you have to outscore the dealer or have him go bust. Let us discuss the rules of Blackjack.  For number cards, the value of the card is the number itself. Face cards are counted as 10. Ace can count as 11 or 1. If the ace puts you over 21, you count it as 1, or else you count it as 11.  The value of a hand is the total of all the individual cards’ values. The highest hand is a "blackjack,” and it consists of an ace and any card with a value of 10. A Blackjack hand outranks all other hands with a value of 21.   Once all the players have placed their bets, the dealer deals out two cards to each player and to himself. Each player’s cards are both dealt face up. One of the dealer’s two cards is face up, and the other is face down. The face-down card is called a “hole card.”  After the cards are dealt, the play begins with the player to the dealer’s left. If you think getting one or more additional cards will get you at or closer to 21, you ask to draw additional cards with a “hit.” If you go over 21, you are bust. You can “stand” if you do not want any more cards to be drawn. You can also “double” your bet, and you will get one more card but no additional cards after that.  If you have a pair or two 10-point cards, you can separate your cards into two individual hands. Doubling the bet, you can then play each of your hands with options we discussed. Remember, each ace only gets one point if you’re splitting them. If you get a ten and ace after splitting, then it counts as 21 points, but not a Blackjack. Sometimes, these rules vary by casino. You can also “surrender” if you forfeit half your wager after the first two cards. In that case, you do not get to play out your hand.  After each player is done with their turn, the dealer turns over his hole card. If the dealer’s hand is valued at 16 or less, he will “hit” to draw additional cards until he goes over 16. If the dealer goes over 21 points, he is bust. Players on the table who are not bust at this point will win. If the dealer does not bust, then whoever has the highest value hand between the dealer and the player wins. You’ll receive even money from winning wagers. If you have a Blackjack, at most casinos, you will be paid 3 to 2.  Blackjack Strategy to Improve Your Odds of Winning  Computer simulations and probability calculations have helped develop a basic Blackjack strategy. If this strategy is fully followed, the house advantage can be reduced to 0.5% over the long run.  Per the basic strategy, here’s what you should do when the first two cards are dealt to you, and you can see dealer’s face up card:   If you have 8 or below, hit irrespective of what the dealer has.  If you have 9 and the dealer has 3, 4, 5 or 6, double your bets. If the dealer has 2 or 7, hit.  If you have 10 and the dealer has anything between 2 and 9, you should double down. If the dealer has a 10 or ace, hit.  If you have 11 and the dealer’s card value is between 2 and 10, double down. If the dealer has an ace, hit.  If you have 12 and the dealer has 2, 3, or 7 and higher, hit. Stand if the dealer has 4, 5 or 6.  If you have between 13 and 16, and the dealer has 7 or higher, hit. If the dealer has between 2 and 6, stand.  Always stand if your cards value between 17 and 21.   Baccarat  Baccarat is one of the oldest and most well-known games played in casinos globally. Some of you may remember Baccarat as James Bond’s preferred casino game. It was featured in the Ian Fleming’s 1953 novel debut of Casino Royale, and later in various Bond movies like Dr. No and GoldenEye . Baccarat’s association with James Bond has made the game sexy and attractive to a lot of people. However, do not be fooled by its sexy appeal or James Bond’s high-IQ character. Baccarat is very much a game of chance with no skill or strategy involved.  How to Play Baccarat  As a player, you have the option to wager on three choices: the Banker’s hand, the Player’s hand or the Tie. Think of the Banker and the Player simply as names for the two hands dealt out in each game; these are two outcomes on which you can wager. The “Player” hand has no particular association with the player, and the “Banker” hand is not necessarily associated with the casino or house.  In many ways, Baccarat is similar to Blackjack. In Baccarat, the winning hand has a value closer to 9, whereas in Blackjack you are trying to get close to but not over 21. Just as in Blackjack, in Baccarat, each card has a specific value. The cards 2 to 9 are worth face value. 10s, Jacks, Queens and Kings have a value of 0. An ace is worth 1 point.  Let us say, the Player hand has two cards, “3” and “4.” The value of the hand is the sum of the two cards, i.e. 3 + 4 = 7. Let us take another example, where the two cards are “7” and “8”. The sum of the card values is 7 + 8 = 15. Since 15 is a 2-digit number, you have to drop the left-most digit. The value of this hand in Baccarat is 5.  Once you have placed your bets on one of the options, Player, Banker or Tie, the dealer delivers two cards each for the Player and Banker hands. Depending on the value of the Player hand, a third card may be given to the Player per the rules below. As a Baccarat player, you do not need to know all the rules. The dealers will direct the next steps based on the rules of the game. If you want to know when a third card is drawn for Player or Banker bet, see here .  Baccarat Strategy to Improve Your Odds of Winning  In Baccarat, you cannot influence the cards with strategy. It is a game of chance, and that is why it is very popular among high rollers. You cannot predict the hand, so feel free to go with your instinct, and appreciate the game. The casinos often provide scorecards to track wins each round (Banker, Player or Tie). Based on the patterns you see, and your intuition, you can place your bets to go with or against the trends. Some experts argue that the score-carding strategy is useless, since the outcome of every game is unrelated to the previous games.  One thing that experts agree is to bet on the Banker when in doubt. Betting on the Banker is usually the safest bet considering the house odds and a slight numbers advantage that works in the Banker’s favor.  Craps  Craps will seem complicated to a beginner at first. The table has a ton of different betting options; the pace is fast, and terms used in the game will seem alien. There is good news, though. Craps offers great odds of winning if you stick to a few fundamental plays.  How to Play Craps  Players wager on the outcome of the roll of a pair of dice thrown on the Craps table. One of the players rolls the dice and is called the shooter. Multiple players line up around the table and make their bets on the outcome of the shooter’s dice rolls.  The first roll is called the “come-out.” You can bet on the “come-out” by placing your chips on the “PASS” or “DON’T PASS” bar. A winning “come-out” roll equals a total of 7 or 11. If you betted on the PASS line, and the outcome is 7 or 11, you win. If the shooter gets a 2, 3 or 12, this is “craps,” and the PASS line bettors lose.  If you are betting on the DON’T PASS line, you will win if the shooter throws a 2 or a 3, while 7 or 11 means you lose since the PASS line bettors just won. If the shooter rolls 12, neither the PASS nor the DON’T PASS line bettors win.  So, what are the outcomes remaining? 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10. If the shooter rolls any of these, that number becomes the “point,” and the dealer marks this number on the table with a puck. On the shooter’s next roll, if he or she rolls the “point,” that’s a “pass,” and the PASS line bets win. The DON’T PASS bets lose, and the game is over. If the shooter rolls a 7 before rolling the “point,” DON’T PASS bets win. DON’T PASS bettors are allowed to remove their bets at any time. All wins pay even money.  The “Odds” is a side bet in Craps you can make after a point is thrown. It pays if the “point” is thrown before 7. Depending on the bet, and the rules at a casino, Craps offers 3, 4 and 5 times the odds offered. Four and 10 mean a 3X flat bet. Five and 9 mean a 4X flat bet. A 6 and 8 offers a 5X flat bet.  Craps Strategy to Improve Your Odds of Winning  If Craps rules seem complicated, start one step at a time. The PASS bet is the most fundamental that almost all players make, and it is easy to understand. Start with a PASS or DON’T PASS bet, and with more experience, engage in more bets. The optimal strategy in Craps is to bet on the DON’T PASS line and back it up by laying the odds. This is contrary to how most players bet in Craps, but it gives you the most edge in the long run. If you want to go with the crowd, even with a PASS strategy, you have a great chance of winning.  Roulette  Roulette is another game that is very easy to play in a casino. It is easy to understand, and a lot of people love the slow pace of roulette compared to other games.  How to Play Roulette  In the game of roulette , you are betting on whether a steel ball spinning over a wheel will land on a certain number or a certain color (i.e. red or black, odd or even numbers or a group of numbers).  The American roulette wheel has 38 number slots consisting of numbers 1 through 36 along with numbers 0 and 00. The European roulette wheel has only one 0 slot.  As a player, you can choose to bet on a particular number or several individual numbers. You can also bet if the ball will land on a black- or a red-colored number slot, or an odd or even number. You can also choose number groupings, for example, 1 to 18 and 19 to 36, and so on. There is a place on the table to bet for each of these situations, and you can place multiple bets during each play. The dealer spins the ball in the direction opposite to that of the turning wheel. The play is only valid when the ball completes three revolutions around the spinning wheel. Players can place bets until the dealer announces “no more bets.”  Once the ball comes to a stop on one of the slots, the dealer makes payments to the winners. If you betted on a red number, and the ball landed on a red slot, you win the amount you betted, 1 to 1. If the ball lands on a particular number you betted on, you win 35 to 1. That is a staggering amount and makes roulette an attractive game to play. Some people strategize to keep betting on the same number to win the big payoff. The payout for each situation is described in more details here .  Give Yourself a Fair Shot at Winning  With some learning, you should be on your way to having a great time with table games the next time you visit a casino. Don’t hesitate to learn from a dealer, and feel free to watch others play before you decide to dive in. A big part of your winning will depend on your luck — what cards you get dealt in Blackjack; whether you bet on the Player or the Banker in Baccarat; if you choose to PASS or DON’T PASS in Craps, or if you choose red or black in a Roulette game. Basic strategy and a bit of practice will position you for success. Now that you know what games offer you the best odds, you will ensure you are trying your luck with the right games.

Is it even possible?  Kevin   This is a typical question one might encounter in an introductory statistics class. Because the sum of a large number of random variables always will approach a bell curve we can use the central limit theorem to get at the answer. From my section on the house edge we find the standard deviation in blackjack to be 1.17. You won't understand this if you haven't studied statistics, but the probability of being at a loss in your example will be the Z statistic of 45000*0.005/(45000 1/2 *1.17) =~ 0.91. Any basic statistics book should have a standard normal table which will give the Z statistic of 0.8186. So the probability of being ahead in your example is about 18%.     I have a few questions regarding blackjack: How often can one expect the dealer to bust and how often can a player expect to win four hands in a row?  John from Westminster, USA   When the dealer stands on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.1% of the time. When the dealer hits on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.6% of the time.  According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of a net win is 42.42%.  However, if we skip ties, the probability is 46.36%.  So, the probability of a four wins in a row is 0.4636 4 = 4.62%.     First of all, I would like to add my name to the growing list of people who love your web site. Your information is quite valuable to both the beginning and expert gambler, and you present your findings in a pleasant, understandable, and even humorous manner. I always check out your site before I head to Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe just to remind me how to play smartly. Anyway, on to my question. Well, more of an observation: when the dealer pulls a 5 on a 16 for their sixth consecutive win, there's always someone who gets up and leaves the table, muttering that the dealer is a mean cruel heartless soul, and goes in search of a "hotter" table. But is there any truth in this? Obviously the dealer is inconsequential to the cards dealt (I like to say the dealer is "simply a messenger of the cards") but are streaks in an 8-deck shoe inevitable, and even predictable? Or is it more like your roulette example, where the odds of each new round are exactly the same? Thanks once again for your web site.  Dave K. from Beverly Hills, California   Thanks for your kind words. Streaks, such as the dealer drawing a 5 to a 16, are inevitable but not predictable. Blackjack is not entirely a game of independent trials like roulette, but the deck is not predisposed to run in streaks. For the non-card counter it may be assumed that the odds are the same in each new round. Putting aside some minor effects of deck composition, the dealer who pulled a 5 to a 16 the last five times in a row would be just as likely to do it the next time as the dealer who had been busting on 16 for several hours.     What are the odds against winning seven hands of blackjack in a row? How about six?  James from Palo Alto, California   According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of an overall win in blackjack is 42.22%, a tie is 8.48%, and a loss is 49.10%. I'm going to assume you wish to ignore ties for purposes of the streak.  In that case, the probability of a win, given a resolved bet, is 46.36%.  The probability of winning n hands is a row is 0.4636 n . So the probability of winning six in a row is 0.99% and seven in a row is 0.46%.     Can it actually be true that what I experience has a statistical base? It seems to me that it takes a lot longer to win X number of chips that to lose the same amount (I only play blackjack). For example, if I start with 300 chips, it might take hours to double my money (my goal), yet I can lost that number in what seems like almost no time at all. Can this really be true? Also, do you have a rule of thumb about when to leave the table when you are winning?  Chris from Gaithersburg, Maryland   What you have experienced is likely the result of some very bad losing streaks. It may also be the result of progressive betting or mistakes in strategy. The basic strategy flat bettor should have a roughly symmetrical expectation in terms of steep ups and downs, slightly favoring steep downs due to the house edge and a 48% chance of a losing hand compared to 43% chance of winning.  If I'm playing for fun then I leave the table when I'm not having fun any longer.     In a six-deck shoe, what is the percentage of times that a blackjack (ace face card or ten) will come up?  Ed from Lynnwood, USA   Let n be the number of decks. The probability of a blackjack is 2*(4/13)*(4n/(52*n-1)). If n=6 the probability is 192/4043 = 4.75%.     Still love your site! I always turn to your site when I'm having questions, most of the time I will find the answer but not always. When playing basic strategy blackjack I understand that I will have ups and downs and over the long run I will roughly break even, my question is what is really "over the long run"? A month, a year, five years? Any ideas?  Kim from Helsinki, Finland   Thanks for the kind words. You ask a good question for which there is no firm answer. It is more a matter of degree, the more you play the more your results will approach the house edge. I recently replaced my blackjack appendix 4 with some information about the standard deviation which may help. For example this table shows that if you play 10,000 hands of blackjack the probability is 90% of finishing within 192 units where you started after subtracting the expected loss due to the house edge. So in 10,000 hands you are likely to win or lose less than 2% of total money bet due to random variation. However if we go up to one million hands the probability is 90% of an 0.2% variation due to luck. In general the variation in the mean is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of hands you play. All of this assumes flat betting, otherwise the math really gets messy.     Please explain how to calculate the probability of a blackjack occurring in a single deck. I can easily work other hands but when a card can be either/or my brain cramps.  Mike from Bossier City, USA   The probability that the first card is an ace is 4/52. The probability that the second card is a 10 point card is 16/51. So the probability of an ace first blackjack is (4/52)*(16/51). Multiply this by 2 because the ten could just as easily be the first card and the answer is 2*(4/52)*(16/51) = 128/2652 = 0.0482655, or about 1 in 20.7 .     Do you have any idea what the "record" is for the most sevens thrown with a pair of fair dice in craps is? I had someone tell me it was 84, but the odds against that many sevens in a row being thrown is so long I'm  skeptical. It seems it's more possible that 84 consecutive passes have come out, but even that's a million to one shot (figuratively--literally, it's much worse). I tried to look on the Web but have no idea where I would find something like that.  Mike   Since this question was submitted, a player held the dice for 154 rolls on May 23, 2009 in Atlantic City.  The probability of this is 1 in  5,590,264,072.  For the probability for any number of throws from 1 to 200, please see my craps survival tables .  For how to solve the problem yourself, see my MathProblems.info site, problem 204.     If I play 100 hands of blackjack at $5 a hand at an 0.5% house edge how much can I lose and still be above three standard deviations south of expectation?  Blair from Christchurch, New Zealand   Your expected loss would be 100*$5*.005=$2.50. The standard deviation of one hand is 1.17, which can be found in my blackjack appendix 7 . So, one standard deviation in your example is $5*1.17*sqr(100)=$58.5. So, the probability of losing $295 or more due to bad luck is .00135 (the Z statistic for -3).     If the first card dealt is an ace what is the probability the dealer will have a blackjack? Assume two decks.  T from Las Vegas, U.S.   There are 103 cards remaining in the two decks and 32 are tens. So the probability of a blackjack is 32/103=31.07%.     What percentage of hands are suited blackjacks? Six-deck shoe, any suit.  RWR from Tuscon, USA   The probability of a suited blackjack in a six-deck game is 2*(4/13)*(6/311) = 0.0118723.     For blackjack, which is the probability to obtain three suited seven in a 6-deck shoe?  Rodrigo from Costa Rica   I attempt to work this out in my blackjack appendix 8 but I’ll work through it more slowly here. We’ll ignore dealer blackjacks to keep things simple and assume the player always hits after two cards. The number of ways to arrange 3 cards in a 6-deck shoe is combin(312,3)=5,013,320. There are 24 sevens in the shoe. The number of ways to arrange 3 sevens out of 24 is combin(24,3)=2024. The probability is the number of winning combinations divided by total combinations, or 2024/5013320=0.0004, or about 1 in 2477.     What piece of information am I missing? If the odds of pulling a ten count card out of a deck is about 30.7% and the odds of pulling out an ace is 7.8% then it seems to me that the combined odds of this happening are about 2.4%. Why do blackjack simulators and blackjack authors state that the odds for a blackjack are 4.7% which happens to twice the calculated odds. What am I missing?  Jeffrey from Loveland   You are forgetting that there are two possible orders, either the ace or the ten can be first. Multiply by 2 and you’ll have your answer.     You go, wiz. Our local casino hands out promotional coupons, which act as a first-card ace in blackjack. From your BJ appendix, most hands containing an ace have a positive expectation, without counting the BJs you’ll get four out of every thirteen plays. Do you know the overall expectation of having an ace as your first card? Thanks.  Victor from Yakima, Washington   According to Stanford Wong’s ’Basic Blackjack’ he says the player’s edge given the first card is an ace is 50.5% (page 124). Your question however could be rephrased as, "what is the value of the ace, given that the other card is not a ten." Using an infinite deck for the sake of simplicity we can breakdown Wong’s number as follows: 0.505 = (4/13)*1.5 + (9/13)*x, where x is what you want to know. Doing some simple algebra we get x=28.5%.     I have just read an article that says it’s proper basic strategy to stand on a multiple card 16, containing a 4 or 5, Vs. a dealer’s 10 in a multiple deck (4 or more decks) blackjack game. I checked your web site and I could only find appendixes for multiple card hands in 1 and 2 deck games. Is this article correct?  Rodney from Clarence, New York   Yes! Good question, even I didn’t know this. The fewer the decks and the greater the number of cards the more this is true. To test the most likely case to favor hitting, 8 decks and only 3 cards, I ran every possible situation through my combinatorial program. The following table displays the results.

The dealer hits on soft 17. I wonder what the odds are of standing on 16 when the dealer’s upcard is 7. It seems only a 10 or face card can beat this and the odds would be in my favor if the dealer draws more than one card. Also, since most strategies are based on millions of calculations done on a computer, I wonder if those of us who will never play a million hands can rely on slight variations like this one. Is this a poor, fair or bad move to make?  Richard S. from Memphis, USA   According to my blackjack appendix 9H the expected return of standing is -0.476476 and of hitting is -0.408624, assuming the 16 is composed of a 10 and 6. So my hitting you will save 6.79 cents for each dollar bet. This is not even a marginal play. There is no sound bite answer to explain why you should hit. These expected values consider all the numerous ways the hand can play out. The best play for a billion hands is the best play for one hand. If you want to deviate from the basic strategy here are some borderline plays: 12 against 3, 12 against 4, 13 against 2, 16 against 10. Deviating on these hands will cost you much less.    My friend and I are debating two blackjack issues that arose from his Caribbean Vacation. (1) What shift in odds does the dealer NOT drawing the second card have? House favor or player favor? (2) in your simulations, what impact does the number of players have on the accuracy of the odds?  Beau from Toronto, Canada   (1) It depends what happens if the dealer does have a blackjack. If the player is guaranteed to lose no more than the original wager then it doesn’t matter if the dealer takes a second card or not. If the player stands to lose the total amount bet after doubling or splitting and the dealer gets a blackjack then that works to the dealer’s advantage. (2) I don’t have to simulate this because the number of players makes no difference.    In blackjack, what is the probability of a blackjack?  Anonymous   It depends on the number of decks. If the number of decks is n then the probability is 2*pr(ace)*pr(10) = 2*(1/13)*(16*n/(52*n-1)), which is conveniently about 1 in 21. 

Here is the exact answer for various numbers of decks.   Probability of Blackjack     Decks  Probability    1  4.827%    2  4.780%    3  4.764%    4  4.757%    5  4.752%    6  4.749%    7  4.747%    8  4.745%        What is the probability that you play ten hands and never obtain a (two-card) 21? Assume the cards are reshuffled after each play?  Matt from Radford, USA   If the probability of a blackjack is p then the probability of not getting any blackjacks in 10 hands is 1-(1-p) 10 . For example in a six deck game the answer would be 1- 0.952511 10 = 0.385251.    What are the odds of getting 3 blackjacks in a row with 1 deck 4 players and one dealer.  Joe P from Parma Heights, USA   I’m going to assume there is never a shuffle between hands. The three other players don’t matter. The answer would be 2 3 *(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47)= 0.00004401, or about 1 in 22722. If there were a shuffle between hands the probability would increase substantially.    In two handed blackjack using one deck, what is the probability of the dealer having a blackjack?  Steve from Solva, United Kingdom   The number of hands doesn’t matter. The probability is 2*(4/13)*(8/103) = 0.0478.    What are the odds of a dealer getting 3 blackjacks in a row on a single deck table with two players?  J.A.S. from Las Vegas, USA   It depends whether there is a shuffle between the blackjacks. Assuming there isn’t the probability would be 8*(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47) = 0.000044011058. The number of other players doesn’t matter, except if they cause a shuffle.    Dear Wizard, I was recently playing blackjack with somewhat of a card-shark who also happens to be my friend. We played casino rules, with one deck- and switched the deal after each time the deck expired. Later, while I was shuffling- I noticed two 9 of spades side by side. My friend obviously claimed he did not know about this, but it seems unlikely. My question is, if you were playing in a similar scenario and were to add one card to the deck, which card would be most advantageous if only you knew about it. Thank you for your time.  Matt   From my blackjack appendix 7 we see that each 9 removed from a single deck game increases the house edge by 0.20%. However if you were going to cheat it would be much better to remove an ace, which increases the house edge by 0.58%. If you were to add a card as the dealer you should add a 5, which increases the house edge by 0.80%. So, the best card for the player is the ace and the best for the dealer is the 5.    I’ve been playing blackjack for quite awhile using basic strategy, mostly betting an even unit each hand. Occasionally I will increase the bet because I "feel" like I am going to win the next one. I would think that just about all recreational players bet on feel once in a while at least. I was reading through some of your past Ask the Wizard columns and saw your calculation of the probability of a string of losses in the August 4, 2002 Column. You know those emotional thoughts that pop in head while gambling (well maybe not your head), "I’m due for a win!" That column seemed to put the mathematics to that "feeling" a player can get. In that columns’ example of a player losing 8 consecutive hands of blackjack the odds were (.5251^8 or about 1 in 173). My question though is what does that really mean? Is it that when I sit down at the table, 1 out of my next 173 playing sessions I can expect to have an 8 hand losing streak? Or does it mean that on any given loss it is a 1 in 173 chance that it was the first of 8 losses coming my way? I know, I know, its some sort of divine intervention betting system I am talking about and no betting system affects the house edge. I’m still curious though. Besides every once in awhile throwing down a bigger bet just adds to the excitement and for some reason it seems logical that if you have lost a string of hands you are "due" for a win.  Steve from Phoenix, AZ   I have no problem with increasing your bet when you get a lucky feeling. What is important is that you play your cards right. Unless you are counting cards you have the free will to bet as much as you want. As I always say all betting systems are equally worthless so flying by the seat of your pants is just as good as flat betting over the long term. When I said the probability of losing 8 hands in a row is 1 in 173 I meant that starting with the next hand the probability of losing 8 in a row is 1 in 173. The chances of 8 losses in a row over a session are greater the longer the session. I hope this answers your question.    Dear wiz, I am a blackjack dealer here in Vegas and the other night dealing, I had 4 out of the 6 ace of spades in my hand. I had A-A-K-A-A-10, so good think is I busted, but quick calculations on the game, we figured getting 4 out of the six aces on one had is around 7mil to 1. Is this number a little high?  Jason   The probability of this occurring in which your other two cards are any two 10-point cards is 4*COMBIN(6,4)*COMBIN(6*16,2)*(4/6)*(3/5)*(1/2)/combin(312,6) 1 in 22,307,231. However there are other ways you get four aces in the same hand, for example the last card might be an 8 or 9. I would have to do a computer simulation to consider all the other combinations. However to make a rough guess I’d say the 7 million looks about right.    After performing my own infinite deck analysis for Blackjack with the same rules as yours (dealer stands all 17s, re-splitting allowed to 4 hands except Aces, which can only be split once, doubling after splitting, draw only one card to split Aces), I came across your site. In comparing expected values, I obtained the same numbers as you in all cases, except for pair splitting, which were slightly different. So I’m wondering how you went about your calculation of expected values for splitting?  Anonymous   It took me years to get the splitting pairs correct myself. Cindy of Gambling Tools was very helpful. Peter Griffin also addresses this topic in chapter 11 of the The Theory of Blackjack Let’s say I want to determine the expected value of splitting eights against a dealer 2. Resplitting up to four hands is allowed. Here is how I did it.   Take a 2 and two 8’s out of the shoe. Determine the probability that the player will not get a third eight on either hand. Go through all ranks, except 8, subtract that card from the deck, play out a hand with that card and an 8, determine the expected value, and multiply by 2. For each rank determine the probability of that rank, given that the probability of another 8 is zero. Take the dot product of the probability and expected value over each rank. Multiply this dot product by the probability from step 2. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 3 hands. Take another 8 out of the deck. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 3 instead of 2. Multiply dot product from step 7 by probability in step 5. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 4 hands. Take two more 8’s out of the shoe. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 4 instead of 2, and this time consider getting an 8 as a third card, corresponding to the situation where the player is forced to stop resplitting. Multiply dot product from step 11 by probability in step 9. Add values from steps 4, 8, and 12. The hardest part of all this is step 3. I have a very ugly subroutine full of long formulas I determine using probability trees. It gets especially ugly when the dealer has a 10 or ace up.    Dear wiz, How do you calculate the probability of getting three sevens, three colored sevens, and three suited sevens in blackjack?  Geoff   Let’s assume six decks of cards and the player always takes a third card (whether by hitting or splitting). The number of ways to draw 3 suited sevens is the number of suits (4) times the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 sevens of that suit in the shoe. In other words 4× combin (6,3)=4×20=80. The number of ways to draw 3 colored sevens, including 3 suited sevens, is the number of colors times the number of ways to pick 3 out of the 12 sevens in the shoe of that color, or 2×combin(12,3)=2×220=440. The number of ways to draw any 3 sevens, including 3 colored and suited sevens, is the number of ways to pick 3 cards out of the 24 sevens in the shoe, or combin(24,3)=2024. The total number of combinations for any 3 cards out of 312 is combin(312,3)=5013320. So the probability of 3 suited sevens is 80/5013320=0.000015957. The probability of three colored, but not suited, sevens is (440-80)/5013320=0.0000718. The probability of three sevens of mixed colors is (2024-440)/5013320= 0.00031596.    Good job and well done. The question: I notice from your May 5, 2003 Column that you actually CALCULATE your blackjack odds. I am a bit surprised that you were not using your computer to SIMULATE the results. Or is this a stupid question, i.e., the computer will take a million years to do the job?  Anonymous   Yes, I calculate blackjack odds using a combinatorial approach, analyzing every possible ways the player and dealer cards can come out, taking the greatest expected value at every decision point. This is harder to program than a simulation but I feel is more elegant and a nice challenge in recursive programming. However I still respect my peers to do simulations. With today’s computers it doesn’t take long to run off a billion bets, which gets very close to the optimal strategy return.    I recently went to Vegas and had an incredible hand of blackjack... received an ace as first card, split, received another ace, split, received a third ace, split, and got one last ace... Then was dealt blackjack on all 4 hands! No lie! 2 of my friends were witnesses, as was the entire Luxor gaming gods...What are the odds on this? It was a 6 card deck shoe, I was sitting in #3 seat of a 4 person game. Assume a fresh shuffle?  Anonymous   Not too many places allow resplitting aces, so be glad you were playing somewhere that did. Your seat position does not matter. The probability of this is the probability that the first four cards out of the shoe are aces, and the next four are tens, or (combin(24,4)/combin(312,4))*(combin(96,4)/combin(308,4)) = 1 in 4,034,213.    I just witnessed a friend get four blackjacks in a row starting with the first hand of a newly shuffled single deck playing head to head against the dealer. I looked at the FAQ’s and saw the odds for getting one blackjack in single deck, but don’t know how to calculate them for getting four in a row off the top. Instead of a decimal probability, could you tell me the odds of this? It must be astronomical. Hope to hear from you.  Anonymous   I seem to get a variation of this question at least once a month. Let’s assume for now the deck is shuffled after every hand, to make the math easier. If the probability of something happening is p then the probability of it happening n times in a row is p n . The probability of a blackjack in a single deck game is 4*16/combin(52,2) = 64/1326. So the probability of four in a row is (64/1326) 4 = 16777216/ 3091534492176 = 1 in 184270. However the actual probability is much less, because as the player gets each blackjack the ratio of aces to cards left in the deck decreases. Without knowing what cards the dealer got I can’t tell you the exact answer.    First I wanted to tell you how much I look at and love your web site, and admire your math skills. I use 6 decks to deal blackjack, and added 3 jokers for reasons I won’t waste your time with but, what are the odds of dealing all 3 jokers to a player right in a row. Thank you very much.  Anonymous   You’re welcome, thanks for you compliments. The probability of being dealt 3 jokers in a row from a six deck shoe (plus the 3 jokers) is 1/combin(315,3) = 1 in 5,159,805. Another solution is (3/315)*(2/314)*(1/313).    Michael, a person asked you if they are not counting cards in blackjack, what difference does it make how many decks are being used. You stated the difference had mostly to do with the number of stiff hands possible, due to the fact that if a small card came out it was more likely a large card would follow and vice-a-versa. How could that be? Would it still not be a random event with the possibility of a small or large card coming out being equal, if you are not counting?  Anonymous   Every legitimate blackjack expert agrees the house edge decreases as the number of decks goes down, all other rules being equal. However it is hard to explain why. First, it is true that you are more likely to get one small card and one big card in single-deck than multiple-deck. For example if we define a small card as 2 through 6, and a large card as any 10-point card or ace then the probability of getting one of each in single deck is 2*(20/52)*(20/51) = 30.17%. The probability in 8-decks is 2*(160/416)*(160/415) = 29.66%. Although stiffs can cut both ways the player has the free will to stand, the dealer must always hit them.    At a single deck game what is the probability all three players and the dealer get a blackjack the first round after a shuffle?  Anonymous   Following are the probabilities: Player 1 0.048265 Player 2 0.036735 Player 3 0.024823 Dealer 0.012560 The product is 1 in 1,808,986.    Mr. Wizard, Great site. There is a lot of useful and interesting info. I’d like to see more of the mathematics and possible sources of simulations (source code, books, etc.) behind the games. Where would you suggest that a person interested in writing something similar to your "blackjack house edge calculator" go for more info? Thank you for your response.  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. I’m afraid I know of no source, including myself, that shows code for game analysis. It took me years to get my blackjack engine to work perfectly (splits when the dealer had a 10 or ace showing was very tricky). An easier way to get the house edge for blackjack is to write a random simulation. One of these days I would like to write a book on how I analyzed the games, but I’m afraid only you would buy it.    What is the probability of a blackjack for n decks?  Anonymous   2*(4/13)*(4n/(52n-1))    I am a blackjack dealer and last night I amazed my table on a single-deck blackjack game (the horrible 6 to 5). My hand consisted of an Ace up, Ace in the hole and then I drew the other 2 Aces and then a 7 for 21! What are the odds of this happening and I am especially interested in knowing the math. Thanks!  Anonymous   The probability is (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49)*(4/48) = 1 in 3,248,700.    In blackjack, what is the probability of the dealer making a stopping hand (17-21) drawing eight cards? This happened to a friend of mine online and I think it's an extremely rare occurrence. How about seven cards? Thanks for the great site and keep up the awesome work!  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. Assuming a six-deck game, where the dealer stands on soft 17, and the player plays basic strategy here are the rounded results based on a 100-million hand simulation.

Also, does increasing the amount available for total wagering increase the likelihood of winning the $200.  Anonymous   If you had a game with no house edge the probability of winning $200 with $5000 to risk, using any system, would be 5000/(5000+200) = 96.15%. The general formula for winning w with a bankroll of b is b/(b+w). So the larger the bankroll the better your chances. The house edge will lower the probability of success by an amount that is hard to quantify. For a low house edge game like blackjack, the reduction in the probability of success will be small. It would take a random simulation to know for sure. Forgive me if I don't bother with that. VegasClick did a small simulation about the probability of success with the Martingale .    As I read your analysis of the Royal Match side bet in blackjack , am I correct that your odds are for the first hand of the shoe? If so, wouldn’t the real-world odds of an easy match be tilted a bit more toward the player? It seems to me that if the suits get unbalanced in any direction it would slightly lessen the house edge, and the suits will certainly fluctuate through the shoe.  Frank from Michigan   This is not true.  The remaining deck needs to be exhibit more than a certain degree of skewness for the odds to swing to the player's favor.  Consider a hypothetical side that pays 3 to 1 for any suited pair in a one-deck game.  Of the top of the deck the probability of winning is 4* combin (13,2)/combin(52,2) = 23.53%.  However if you burn two cards of different suits the probability of winning goes down to 2*(combin(13,2)+combin(12,2))/combin(50,2) = 23.51%.  If you burn two cards of the same suit the probability of winning increases to (3*combin(13,2)+combin(11,2))/combin(52,2) = 23.59%. If one card of each rank were removed the probability of winning would go down to 4*combin(12,2)/combin(48,2) = 23.40%.  What all this shows is that if cards are removed at a uniform distribution the odds of winning go down, however at a very skewed distribution the odds go up. As the deck is played down sometimes your odds get better, and sometimes worse, but in the long run they average out and stay at a 23.53% chance of winning.    I have been a dealer for 27 years and have seen a lot.  One of my favorites was a guy who never looked at his cards playing blackjack....just tucked them.  I thought he was nuts of course but some days he won and some days he lost.  Just like most people.  I tried this myself on a free gambling website and won 2 out of 3 times gambling 20 minute sessions.  My question is this:  How much worse off are you doing this than trying to play basic strategy?  I really don’t think it matters much at all what you do in blackjack for the ’average’ player.  Mark from Las Vegas   Under typical Vegas rules (6-deck, dealer hits soft 17) the house edge by always standing is 15.7%.  In the short-run one could still overcome that, but in the long run you’ll lose badly.    I lost a lot of money playing Cryptologic Blackjack today.  While I don’t think anything is fixed, one aspect of my play seemed well outside the range of probability.  Within 35 hands, the dealer showed a 6 seven times and won each time.  This was verified through the logs.  If the probability of a dealer bust is 56% with a six, my calculation suggests the odds of this independent event happening six consecutive times is 0.23%.  Adam from Toronto   At Cryptologic they use 8 decks and the dealer stands on a soft 17.  According to my blackjack appendix 2 , the probability of the dealer busting with a 6 up is 0.422922.  So the probability of not busing is 1 - 0.422922 = 0.577078.  The probability of not busing 7 times out of 7 is (0.577078) 7 = 2.13%.    First off, my apologies if you consider this a basic math question.  I’m a dealer at a Northern Ontario casino, and last night (for the dealer) drew a 12-card 17 (A-A-A-A-A-A-6-A-A-A-A-A).  We use six decks.  Neither my player or I had ever seen this before.  What are the odds of this?  Timothy Rowland from Orilila   Wow!  The probability of this is (combin(24,6)/combin(312,6)) * (24/306) * (combin(18,5)/combin(305,5)) = 1 in 287,209,346,813,617.    I am a pit supervisor at a local casino and recently had a dealer deal two players two seven of clubs each and give himeself the last seven of clubs as his upcard on a five-deck shoe.  What are the odds of five of the same card coming out of a five-deck shoe in order?  Jesse from Scottsdale   That probability would be 52/ combin (260,5) = 5/9525431552 = 1 in 1,905,086,310.    According to standard BJ rules and perfect basic strategy, how many percent of my DOUBLED DOWN hands should I expect to win, push and lose?  Cameron from Melbourne, Australia   Assuming liberal Vegas Strip rules (six decks, dealer stands on soft 17, double after split allowed, late surrender allowed, resplitting aces allowed) the following are the probabilities of each possible outcome when doubling on the initial two cards.  This does not include doubling after splitting.   Win: 54.99% Lose: 38.06% Draw: 6.95%  I’ve played a lot of Blackjack over the years but have never struck anything like the situation I experienced on the weekend.  Playing $25 a hand I lost 19 hands in a row with no pushes.  One of the hands was a double down, so effectively I lost 20 x $25 bets in a row. I was playing strict Basic Strategy for New Zealand conditions (not counting, CSM in use).  Have you ever heard of such a horror streak?  I was ahead about $300 when the sky fell in but stuck to the strategy and eventually left the session $200 ahead and very relieved.  My calculations estimate the probability of 19 straight losses as 1 chance in about 207,000; you may well correct me on this.  I play to a betting progression system, purely for discipline/money management purposes which has me betting 1 unit after every loss.  Had I done anything differently, I would have been cleaned out well before the 19 hands came up.  Ken from Auckland, New Zealand   From my blackjack appendix 4 we see the following probabilities for each initial hand.    Win 42.43% Lose 49.09% Draw 8.48%  So the probability of going exactly 19 losses in a row is 0.4909^19*(1-0.4909) = 1 in 1,459,921.  By way of comparison, the probability of being dealt a royal flush in video poker is 1 in 649,740, or 2.25 times as likely.  Avid video poker players have been known to receive several dealt royals, so if you play a lot of blackjack you’ll likely hit such a losing streak eventually.    I’m totally baffled!  If in an 8-deck or continuous shuffle blackjack game there is no difference in the probabilities of a card appearing at any time, why have you posted Blackjack Appendix #18 ?  If the probabilities say hit on 16 vs. 7 or higher, how can the probabilities change if you have 5 or 6 cards as opposed to 2 cards?  16 is 16 no matter how you construct it, right?  I see the change if the deck is shrinking or in a game like Spanish 21 where there is a bonus for 21 with 5 or more cards, but why in an 8-deck game or continuous shuffle?  Ernie from Toledo   The reason the strategy changes, according to the number of cards in your hand, as shown in appendix 18, is that every card that leaves the deck changes the probabilities of every card left to be played.  A good example is the single-deck basic strategy says to surrender 7,7 against a 10; but for any other 14 you should hit.  The reason you should surrender is half the sevens have already been removed from the deck.  You need another seven to make 21, the only hand that will beat a dealer 20.  So the shortage of sevens lowers the expected value of hitting to under half a bet, making surrender the better play. In an eight-deck shoe there are 416 cards.  That may seem like a lot, but 16 against a 10 is such a borderline hand that removal of just one card can making standing a better play.  The rule is that for eight or fewer decks if your 16 is composed of three or more cards, and the dealer has a 10, then you should stand. In a two-card 16 the average points per card is 8, with a 3-card 16 the average is 5.33.  With more small cards out of the deck in the 3-card hand the remaining deck becomes more large card rich, making hitting more dangerous, swaying the odds in favor of standing.    Hi Wizard.  Thanks for maintaining this web site! I have a question about a blackjack rule that is applied in Dutch casinos: When being dealt a pair of sevens, a third seven will earn you 2:1 on your bet, regardless if you win the hand or not. However, this only applies when the sevens have NOT been split. I know that there are 6 dealer up cards in basic strategy that allow splitting sevens and 7 that do not, so the player should have an edge in this particular situation. But what are the odds of being dealt 3 sevens in blackjack in the first place? And if dealt 3 sevens, what are the odds they qualify for the 2:1 pay-out rule, based on a 4 to 6 decks, dealer stands on soft 17 basic strategy chart? Hope you can figure this one out for me. Keep up the good work!  Stan from The Netherlands, Europe   I show that rule is worth 0.026% to the player.  Despite the incentive to hit 7,7 against a dealer 2-7, the player should still follow basic strategy and split.    I have a friend who starts complaining when his first card is a six, without waiting to see what his second card and the dealer’s up card are.  I think he should wait because he could get a two, three, four, five, etc. (i.e., a decent second card) OR the dealer could show a two through six (a good card for the table).  What do you think?  How much worse are his odds of winning with a first card of six without knowing this second card or the dealer’s up card? Or is my friend just a whiner?  Thank you for your time.  Scott from Long Beach   My blackjack appendix 14 shows that if your first card is a six your expected value is already about −21%.  For example, if he bet $100, a fair price to sell the hand and bet would be about $79. Maybe you can take advantage of his complaining by offering to buy his hand for less than the fair 79 cents on the dollar.  I’d suggest 75 cents on the dollar, to give you an edge, without taking too much advantage.    Bally Gaming has a single-deck, multi-hand, blackjack game.  The player plays seven hands against a single dealer hand.  There is an interesting rule in that if the game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  What is the probability of running out of cards?  Can have suggest any strategy changes to run out the deck?  Michael L. from West Mifflin, PA   For the benefit of other readers, the full set of rules is:   Single deck. Dealer stands on soft 17. Winning blackjack pays even money. Player may double any first two cards. No double after split. Player may resplit to four hands, including aces. No draw to split aces. No surrender. Six-card Charlie (player unbusted six cards automatically wins). Cards shuffled after every hand. If game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  The house edge using total-dependent basic strategy is 2.13%.  I ran a 7-player simulation, using total-dependent basic strategy, and the average number of cards used per round was 21.65, with a standard deviation of 2.72.  In almost 190 million rounds played, the most cards ever used was 42, which happened 7 times. It is my educated opinion that even with computer perfect composition-dependent strategy the player would still realistically never see the last card.  You could cut down the house edge much more using composition-dependent strategy, according to all the cards seen as you go along.  However bucking 2.13% house edge to start with, you’ll never get anywhere near break-even, regardless of how hard you try.    Recently, the Tuscany casino ran a promotion where if you got 30 blackjacks in a 30-day period, you would win a $100 bonus. At first, the minimum bet was $5 to get your card stamped. However, I later heard the minimum for a stamp was raised to $15. I wrote a letter of complaint about it to the casino manager, stating in part:   I just wanted to express my disappointment in this change, if it is true. I never had a chance to take advantage of the promotion and doubt I will be able to now. The amount of time necessary to receive 30 blackjacks (I’m told about 8 hours of continuous play) seems unreasonable at $15/hand when the promotion still offers only $100.  Here is the reply I received:  In response to your e-mail on the blackjack blackout promotion, I’m not sure where you received your information on how long it takes to complete the blackout card. We’ve seen players complete the card in less than four hours. Also, you have thirty days in which to complete the card. I hope you understand this is not a task that is unreachable with that much time. I THANK YOU for your letter. It’s good to hear feedback from our customers. Hope you can give it a try and win some money! What is the probability of getting 30 blackjacks in four hours?  nyuhoosier   According to my game comparison , blackjack players play about 70 hands per hour.  The probability of a blackjack in a six-deck game is 24*96/combin(312,2)=4.75%.  I assume a blackjack tie still gets a stamp.  So it should take about 30/0.0475=632 hands to fill the card, or 9.02 hours. The probability of filling the card in 4 hours, assuming 280 hands, is 1 in 30,000 playing one hand at a time.  I suspect any player achieving the goal in four hours was playing at least two hands at a time. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas .    On a recent Vegas trip I saw the dealer get a 9-card 21.  The rules were six decks and the dealer stood on soft 17.  What are the odds of that?  aceofspades   The probability of the dealer getting exactly a 9-card 21 under those rules is 1 in 32,178,035.

CLOSE                                     10 Tips to Beat the Odds at the Casino     BY the mag , BY Jeff Wilser  February 18, 2016                         Bill Zender is the ultimate gambling insider. The former professional card counter, dealer, and casino floor manager shares his secrets—and explains why the best paying machine is always the ATM.  1. Identify the clumsiest dealers.  Zender estimates there are fewer than 100 professional blackjack card counters in the world. If you happen to be one of them, you might nab a 1.5 percent advantage. So save your energy, Zender advises; instead keep an eye out for the sloppy blackjack dealer who will accidentally flash the face-down card. Zender once made a living exploiting this, keeping a notebook of 35 weak dealers from 16 different casinos. The strategy is called “card holing,” and it can give you a 6 to 9 percent edge over the house. (That’s like standing in front of an ATM that spits out twenties!) The best part? “It’s totally legal,” Zender says. “They may throw me out of the casino, but they’re not going to arrest me.”  2. Keep your eyes on the prize.  Lately, casinos have sexed up their table games with bikini-clad dealers and resident pole dancers. These places are called Party Pits, and on the surface, they look like Vegas being Vegas—booze, sin, skin. But look closer. While all those twirling legs keep you distracted, you’ll probably fail to notice that the casino trimmed the payouts at these tables from 3/2 to 6/5. Meaning that a $100 bet wins only $120, compared to the traditional $150. This essentially doubles the house’s edge.  3. Know when to say when.  The house always enjoys a 5 percent edge at roulette. You have a decent chance of winning that first spin. And the second. And the third. But if you were to play roulette forever, the house would take away all your chips. Every casino has calculated the point at which they are guaranteed victory, and that magic number is 30,000 hands. (This is why they lure us back with lobster and luxury suites.) So if you’re winning, stop.  4. Exploit the laws of nature.  The roulette wheel is a mechanical instrument. Over time, the wheel may become unbalanced or the frets separating the numbers may suffer wear and tear. The more a wheel is used, the more worn down it gets—and the more it may privilege certain numbers. In 1873, Joseph Jagger found a wonky wheel at Monte Carlo and bet on the biased numbers. He came away with $400,000—that’s $7.8 million in today’s dough!  5. Go big or go broke.  “The average slot machine is probably two, three times more costly to players than the table games,” says Zender. Avoid them. If you insist on cranking a handle, focus on slots that cost $5 or more and play the max bet. On penny slots, the odds are jacked up in the house’s favor by 15 to 20 percent. You might as well toss those coins in a fountain. Don’t forget to make a wish.  6. Don’t play Keno.  Really, just don’t. Your chances are terrible. At some casinos, the house has a 35 percent edge. No gambler has ever matched all 20 numbers on a 20-spot ticket. The odds of it ever happening are 1 in 3,535,316,142,212,174,336. (That’s 3.5 quintillion!)  7. Practice makes perfect.  If there’s an exception to the adage that the house always wins, it’s in video poker. Typically, the house has only a 0.46 percent advantage (while some versions lean in the gambler’s favor). The pay table is posted right on the machine, and the payoff is high. The catch? To cash out, you need to play at an expert level. Casinos make profits on video poker because most players simply aren’t skilled enough. So study up.  8. Stay away from the light.  “Ninety percent of the people who walk into a casino have no idea of the odds stacked against them,” Zender says. But if you know what you’re looking for, it’s easy to see where the odds are the worst. Casinos make the games with the lousiest odds the most attractive by amping them up with flashing lights and bright colors. At craps, for instance, the craziest bets—“the Field,” “Any 7”—are the most colorful. So as a general rule, to better your odds, stick to the drab side of the room.  9. Invest in a nice watch.  There’s a reason you probably won’t see any clocks or windows on the house floor. Casinos want you to lose track of time so you play for as long as possible. Some casinos prohibit dealers from wearing watches for that reason. Once you’re up a bit, it might be a good time to leave the floor and go treat yourself to a new timepiece.  10. Buy your own drinks.  The truth is, nothing is free—and that includes the free booze. Each casino has something they call a “player reinvestment” fund. It predicts the amount of money you’ll lose and then returns a cut of that in the form of comps, which, to the casual floor visitor, means watery well cocktails. The worse your odds, the better your chances of landing a free drink. Cheers!

"You're too fat to be an astronaut," he once told a boy sharing his dream of space travel.  British media who delighted in quoting him are still lamenting the 96-year-old's recent retirement from public duties. But the people of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu are likely to be optimistic he'll now have the time to join them: They worship him as a god and have based a religion on him.  Followers of the Prince Philip Movement, which started in the 1960s, believe that the prince was born to fulfill an ancient prophecy: that the son of an ancient mountain spirit would one day take the form of a pale-skinned man, travel abroad, marry a powerful lady, and eventually return to the island. When villagers saw the prince’s portrait, they felt the spirit in it, and when he visited Vanuatu in 1974, they were convinced.  Chief Jack Naiva, a respected warrior in the culture, greeted the royal yacht and caught sight of Philip on board. "I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform," Naiva once said. "I knew then that he was the true messiah."  True believers assign large world movements to the machinations of Philip. They once claimed his powers had enabled a black man to become president of the United States and that his "magic" had assisted in helping locate Osama bin Laden. The community has corresponded with Buckingham Palace and even sent Philip a nal-nal , a traditional club for killing pigs, as a token of its appreciation. In return, he sent a portrait in which he’s holding the gift.             TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images      The picture is now part of a shrine set up in Yaohnanen in Vanuatu that includes other photos and a Union flag. In May 2017, shortly after the Prince announced his retirement, a cyclone threatened the island—and its shrine. But according to Matthew Baylis , an author who has lived with the tribe, the natives didn't see this so much as a cause for concern as they did a harbinger of the prince's arrival so he can bask in their worship. To date, Prince Philip has not announced any plans to relocate. A version of this story ran in a 2012 issue of Mental Floss magazine.  celebrities  Europe  History  News  politics  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                          John Ueland      arrow   History     How a Single Mom Created a Plastic Food-Storage Empire     BY Jen  Doll  June 6, 2017          John Ueland              On an unseasonably warm day in April 1954, hundreds of women in cowboy hats gathered outside Tupperware’s Florida headquarters to dig for buried treasure. There, in a nearby swampy area dubbed the “Forest of Spades,” 600 shovels stood at the ready. The excitement was palpable. At the appointed signal, the women raced for the roped-off soil, grabbed shovels, and began to hunt frantically for loot.  It was the pinnacle of the inaugural Tupperware Jubilee, a five-day, gold-rush-themed affair celebrating all things Tupperware. No expense was spared: To give the event a Western feel, frontier-style buildings with false fronts had been erected and bulls and horses were trucked in. The women, and a smattering of men, had traveled from all across the country to participate. A collection of Tupperware dealers, distributors, and sales managers, they made the pilgrimage for the motivational speeches, sales instruction, and especially for the bizarre bonding rituals.  For five hours that day, they prospected for mink stoles and freezer units, gold watches and diamond rings. One of them, Fay Maccalupo of Buffalo, New York, dug up a toy car. When she saw the real Ford it represented, she planted her face against the hood and began to weep, repeating, “I love everybody.” Four women fainted and had to be revived with smelling salts. It was understandable, considering that the total cash value of all the prizes buried in the Florida dirt was $75,000.  Presiding over the treasure hunt was the general sales manager of the Tupperware Home Parties division, a 40-year-old woman named Brownie Wise. For hours, she cheered on the ladies from a loudspeaker with an air of royalty. As she watched them hop on shovels and unearth the rewards of their labors, she couldn’t help but feel proud. Wise took satisfaction in seeing her hard work pay off—once again. The jubilee, which she had organized, had all the pizzazz and spirit expected of an official Tupperware event. The media agreed: Network news was there to cover it, and Life magazine ran a photo essay highlighting the excitement and glamour.  Clearly, there’s more to Tupperware than leftovers. The story of the ubiquitous plastic container is a story of innovation and reinvention: how a new kind of plastic, made from an industrial waste material, ended up a symbol of female empowerment. The product ushered women into the workforce, encouraging them to make their own money, better their families, and win accolades and prizes without fear of being branded that 1950s anathema, “the career woman.”  Digging in the dirt for a gold watch may not mesh with today’s concept of a successful working woman, but at the time, the near-religious fervor seen at the jubilees and other Tupperware gatherings demonstrated just how ground-breaking the company’s sales plan was—the product became a multimillion dollar success not by exploiting women, but by embracing and boosting them. All of this was because of Brownie Wise. The story of Tupperware is her story.  Brownie Wise, named for her big, brown eyes, was born in rural Georgia. Her parents divorced when she was young, and as a teen she traveled with her mother, who organized union rallies. While touring the Deep South, Brownie started giving speeches at her mother’s rallies and soon proved to be a gifted and motivating orator. She “awed people,” writes Bob Kealing in his biography Tupperware Unsealed. “[They] were surprised that someone so young could deliver a speech like a pastor.”  Wise was married briefly, but by 27, she was a divorced single mom in suburban Detroit. During World War II, she worked as a secretary at Bendix Aviation, a company that made parts for navy torpedo planes. It was a decent but unfulfilling job. On the side, Wise penned an advice column for the Detroit News, writing under the alter ego “Hibiscus.” A housewife who led an idyllic life with her child and husband in a home called “Lovehaven,” Hibiscus had everything Wise did not. But what Wise did possess was an endless fountain of determination. As she wrote in a journal at that time, “I wanted to be a successful human being.”  It all started with a bad door-to-door salesman. When a Stanley Home Products salesman knocked on her door and proceeded to deliver a terrible sales pitch for cleaning supplies, Wise scoffed that she could do better. At the time, Stanley was experimenting with a peculiar sales model: home parties. A New Hampshire mop salesman had watched his numbers fly through the roof after he invited a bunch of women over for a party that included a mop demonstration. The company encouraged other salesmen to try the strategy, but many of them delegated the party-hosting to their wives. Thinking it’d be a fun job on the side, Wise started selling Stanley products at parties too. Before long, she was making enough money to quit her job at Bendix.  Wise was blessed with the gift of gab, and her special blend of folksy real talk and motherly encouragement helped her rise through Stanley’s ranks. Soon she was in management and hoping to ascend even higher. But those illusions were quashed at a meeting with Stanley head Frank Beveridge, who told Wise she’d never become an executive. Its halls were “no place for a woman,” he said. Wise returned home furious. The rejection lit a fire in her—she vowed that someday, somehow, she would prove Beveridge wrong.  She didn’t know that the key to fulfilling this dream would be in plastic food-storage containers. Wise first glimpsed Tupperware at a sales meeting. One of her coworkers had seen the products gathering dust in a department store and decided to bring them in. At first, Wise didn’t think they were anything special. But when she accidentally knocked a Tupperware bowl off the table, she realized its full potential: Instead of breaking, it bounced.  It seemed like magic. Tupperware was unlike any home product she’d seen before. It was attractive, coming in pastel colors and flexible shapes, almost like art. More importantly, it was functional—no other competing product even came close. Convinced of its potential, Wise traded in her Stanley brooms in 1949 and started throwing parties to sell Tupperware. What she didn’t intend, exactly, was to kindle a revolution.        AP  The most amazing thing about Tupperware wasn’t that it extended the life of leftovers and a family’s budget, although it did both remarkably well. It was, above all, a career maker. When women came to one of Wise’s parties, they were more than just convinced to buy the product— Wise was such a charming host that she persuaded many buyers to also become Tupperware salespeople. The more parties Wise hosted, the more tricks she learned to convert women into Tupperware faithful. Putting people on waiting lists, for instance, made them more eager to buy, so she signed them up regardless of whether the product was available. She also discovered that throwing containers full of liquid across the room made customers reach straight for their checkbooks. Amassing more and more saleswomen, Wise encouraged her followers to do the same. By October 1949, she had 19 recruits, enough to move her supplies out of her house and into a larger warehouse. Driven by the idea of making money simply by throwing parties for friends and neighbors, the women in Wise’s workforce ballooned in number. Soon, other Tupperware parties were taking place across the country. Wise’s team in Detroit was selling more Tupperware than most department stores. This soon attracted the attention of the no-nonsense founder of the Tupperware Corporation, Earl Silas Tupper. Tupperware, true to its name, was Tupper’s masterpiece, and he was counting on it to make his dreams come true. Having grown up in a poor Massachusetts farm family, he had vowed to make a million dollars by the time he was 30. He hadn’t. He did have a host of esoteric inventions—among them, a fish-powered boat and no-drip ice cream cone—under his belt. But with a wife and family to support, he’d concentrated on a practical career in plastics, first at DuPont and then at a company of his own, which made parts for Jeeps and gas masks during World War II. When the war ended, Tupper decided to buy cheap surpluses left over from wartime manufacturing. He figured he’d be able to do something with them. That’s how he ended up with a glob of greasy black polyethylene, a smelly waste product left behind when metal is created from ore. Tupper took it and, after months of trial and error, wrangled the slag into submission, creating a light-weight plastic that refused to break. Tupper dubbed it “Poly-T,” and, taking inspiration from the way paint cans sealed, created a flexible container with a noiseless lid that snapped on. He called the box Tupperware. He patented the seal in 1949 and rolled out 14 products he called the “Millionaire Line.” The only problem? He couldn’t get anyone to buy it. At least not until Wise came along. Her sales record was remarkable—in 1949, she’d rung up $150,000 in orders and was offered a promotion: distribution rights to the entire state of Florida. In the spring of 1950, she moved south with her son, Jerry, and her mother. She found a store space, and by May she’d opened her business and was scouting for new salespeople. Still, not everything was going smoothly. Along with disputes over turf with other distributors, she was constantly contending with botched orders, shipping delays, and product shortages. In March of 1951, Wise had had enough. She called Tupper in a fury. It was the first time they’d spoken, but she was too livid for niceties; she ripped into him immediately. This was hurting not just her bottom line, but also his. Did he not understand how crucial it was that the problems be fixed immediately? Tupper assured her that he’d fix any issues and then asked a favor: He wanted to hear her sales secrets. The next month, the two met at a conference on Long Island and Wise explained her selling technique. It was pointless, she explained, to think that people would see Tupperware on store shelves or in catalogs and want to buy it. Instead, people had to touch it, squeeze it, drop it, seal it. They had to experience Tupperware from a trusted friend or neighbor. She gave a bold prescription for saving Tupper’s business: Ditch department stores altogether and focus entirely on throwing home parties. Tupper took the advice to heart. So much, in fact, that the day after their meeting, he created a new division just for home parties and asked Wise to be the general manager. Wise had reached her goal: She had become an executive. It was a perfect fit, too. She had a stellar track record—she was selling more Tupperware than anyone anywhere—and Tupper was bowled over by her charm. “You talk a lot and everybody listens,” he said. “She was the yin to Tupper’s yang,” Kealing writes. “Where he was fussy and reclusive, Wise lived to mingle with and inspire the dealer workforce.” They were a match made in sales heaven. Or so it seemed.       AP  In 1952, the first full year of Wise’s watch, Tupperware sales rocketed. Wholesale orders exceeded $2 million. During the last half of the year, sales tripled. Tupperware parties did exactly what Wise promised they would, and she became the company’s shining star. That year, Tupper gave her a salary of $20,933.33, more than she had ever made. For her birthday in 1953, he presented her with a gold-dyed palomino horse. Even more remarkably, he gave her the freedom to do practically whatever she wanted. So Wise traveled the country recruiting, presiding over sales conferences, and announcing contests and doling out prizes for incentive—including, sometimes, her own clothes. By the looks of it, most of Wise’s Tupperware recruits fit neatly into the stereotypical role of a proper housewife. But, in reality, they surreptitiously represented a new kind of female empowerment. During World War II, many women had no choice but to enter the workforce. At its end, many of them had no choice but to leave it. Suddenly, selling Tupperware at parties allowed women to straddle both worlds. They were employed, yet they didn’t appear to challenge their husbands' authority or the status quo. This pioneering entrepreneurial model allowed them to inhabit a workforce outside of the one the hustling salesman inhabited, and, in many cases, to do even better than he did. And that power relied specifically on a network of female friends and neighbors. The parties weren’t just a way for women to keep occupied—it was a way they could contribute to their family’s bottom line. Most women who worked outside the home had low-paying jobs in fields like light manufacturing, retail, clerical work, and health and education. The money—committed dealers could bring in $100 or more per week—was a revelation. The opportunity for success was so great that the husbands of some Tupperware ladies left their own jobs to work with their wives. Wise was something of an early Oprah, giving away fantastic prizes, operating in a grass-roots, word-of-mouth fashion and showing rather than telling other women how to succeed in the comfort of their own homes. The fact that she made many women understand the benefits of becoming salespeople, building the brand further, simply made her a fantastic executive. Wise embraced the spirit of female entrepreneurship wholeheartedly. In her prime, she wrote a morale-boosting newsletter called Tupperware Sparks , published a primer called Tupperware Know-How , and had a 52-minute film, A Tupperware Home Party , made as a training tool. She even convinced Tupper to move the company headquarters to Florida. When Tupper bought property in Kissimmee, Wise turned it into a Mecca-like pilgrimage site for Tupperware devotees. Part of the power of Wise’s sales technique, which at times seemed more faith than business, was that it gave the impression that the sky was the limit, and it relied on collective power. This wasn’t just the traditional salesperson’s dog-eat-dog world: Instead, the group was a “family” that helped one another climb to the top. Women who had previously only had their names in print upon birth or marriage were being recognized for their success, with their names, photographs, and accomplishments appearing in Wise’s newsletters. Along with making their own money, they received rewards—top distributors got cars—and the chance to collaborate with other women in a friendly but competitive environment. Wise increased the fervor with her annual jubilees, which had their own rituals, like candlelit graduation ceremonies and group sing-alongs featuring choruses of “I’ve got that Tupper feeling deep in my heart.” “No woman got praised for scrubbing floors,” Elsie Mortland, who became Tupperware’s Home Kitchen Demonstrator, told Kealing in an interview in 2005. “But when they got praised for selling Tupperware, they had something to be proud of.” Wise was the head of the household, and the Tupperware ladies all wanted to be a part of her extended family. Success was limited only by how hard a person was willing to work, a belief that Wise preached passionately. Unfortunately, she had been duped into thinking her boss shared that opinion.       Alamy  As Wise became the face of Tupperware, sales and press continued to skyrocket. In 1954, she was the first woman to appear on the cover of Business Week. But as glowing as the magazine’s profile was, it contained warning signs about the future of her partnership with Tupper. The piece credited Wise and her sales technique with Tupperware’s estimated $25 million in retail sales and seemed to downplay Tupper’s role as president of the company he had created. Tupper had never craved the spotlight; in fact, he was known to use the back door of his office to avoid attracting attention. But he was keen to ensure that his product, not an employee, received the lion’s share of any attention. And somewhere along the way, Wise had started to upstage the plastic containers she helped make famous. After the Business Week article, Tupper wrote a note to Wise that contained a glimmer of the storm that was to come: “However, good executive as you are, I still like best the pictures ... with TUPPERWARE!” The good press continued but, in 1955, after several powerful distributors left the company, sales began to lag. Hard times strained Wise and Tupper’s relationship. By 1956, angry letters were flying back and forth between them, and at one point, Tupper stopped taking Wise’s calls. Her complaints and frank criticisms, previously helpful, had become jabs he couldn’t endure. He also started to believe that she was costing him money, irked that she had her own side business selling self-help books at company events. More to the point, he started to suspect that if he tried selling the company—which he was planning to do—having a female executive would get in the way. Finally, in 1958, Tupper flew to Florida and fired Wise. After a heated legal battle, she received only $30,000 as a settlement. She didn’t own her house and was ordered to vacate. She had no stocks in the company; she didn’t even own many of the clothes she wore. The man she’d helped make a millionaire didn’t seem to care: Tupper ordered her name expunged from the company history and buried the 600 remaining copies of her book in an unmarked pit behind Tupperware’s Florida headquarters. Later that year, he sold the company to Rexall Drug for $16 million, divorced his wife, and bought an island in Central America. He died in Costa Rica in 1983. Wise, on the other hand, tried starting new companies but never achieved the same success she had with Tupperware. She led a quiet life with her horses, pottery, and her son until she died at her home in Kissimmee in 1992. Her influence, however, has not waned. Today, according to the PBS American Experience documentary Tupperware! , the product is sold in about 100 countries, while “every 2.5 seconds, a Tupperware party is held somewhere in the world.” In this respect, the Golden Age of Tupperware hasn’t ended so much as it has solidified. When was the last time you stored food in a plastic container with a sealing mechanism? Tupperware is so much a part of our food culture that we don’t even think about its continuing influence, and yet we still rely on it daily. This story is one of reinvention too: a useless plastic reimagined into something needed, of food being stored in wholly new ways, of women emerging from their kitchens to showcase their worth and proclaim their identities, of sales techniques evolving to embrace the customer, and of the singular character of Brownie Wise, who changed what it meant to be a woman in the workforce. Because of that, as Houston Post writer Napoleon Hill wrote in 1956, “It has been estimated that Brownie Wise has helped more women to financial success than any other single living person.” Early in Wise’s tenure at the company, Tupper presented her with a piece of the raw polyethylene he’d used to make Tupperware. She saw it as poetic proof of his vision: He had created something beautiful from this unappealing glob of plastic, using nothing but imagination and persistence. It was “the best sales story I have ever heard in all my life,” she wrote. She considered “Poly,” as Tupper called it, a prized possession and would have her women touch it for good luck, telling them, “Just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want. Know it’s going to come true, and then get out and work like everything ... and it will!”  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                                SECTIONS     arrow   LIVE SMARTER          LIVE SMARTER   LIVE SMARTER  BIG QUESTIONS  WEATHER WATCH  JOB SECRETS  QUIZZES  WORLD WAR 1  SMART SHOPPING  STONES, BONES, & WRECKS  #TBT  THE PRESIDENTS  WORDS  RETROBITUARIES         arrow   LIVE SMARTER      This Is The Right Way to Load Your Dishwasher         USPS's 'Informed Delivery' Service Will Email You Pictures of the Mail You're Getting Today           13 Amazon Echo Hacks to Get the Most Out of Alexa           MORE LIVE SMARTER                             More from mental floss studios                                MENTAL FLOSS   ABOUT  RSS  CONTACT US  SHOP   ©2018 Mental Floss, Inc.

CLOSE                                     10 Tips to Beat the Odds at the Casino     BY the mag , BY Jeff Wilser  February 18, 2016                         Bill Zender is the ultimate gambling insider. The former professional card counter, dealer, and casino floor manager shares his secrets—and explains why the best paying machine is always the ATM.  1. Identify the clumsiest dealers.  Zender estimates there are fewer than 100 professional blackjack card counters in the world. If you happen to be one of them, you might nab a 1.5 percent advantage. So save your energy, Zender advises; instead keep an eye out for the sloppy blackjack dealer who will accidentally flash the face-down card. Zender once made a living exploiting this, keeping a notebook of 35 weak dealers from 16 different casinos. The strategy is called “card holing,” and it can give you a 6 to 9 percent edge over the house. (That’s like standing in front of an ATM that spits out twenties!) The best part? “It’s totally legal,” Zender says. “They may throw me out of the casino, but they’re not going to arrest me.”  2. Keep your eyes on the prize.  Lately, casinos have sexed up their table games with bikini-clad dealers and resident pole dancers. These places are called Party Pits, and on the surface, they look like Vegas being Vegas—booze, sin, skin. But look closer. While all those twirling legs keep you distracted, you’ll probably fail to notice that the casino trimmed the payouts at these tables from 3/2 to 6/5. Meaning that a $100 bet wins only $120, compared to the traditional $150. This essentially doubles the house’s edge.  3. Know when to say when.  The house always enjoys a 5 percent edge at roulette. You have a decent chance of winning that first spin. And the second. And the third. But if you were to play roulette forever, the house would take away all your chips. Every casino has calculated the point at which they are guaranteed victory, and that magic number is 30,000 hands. (This is why they lure us back with lobster and luxury suites.) So if you’re winning, stop.  4. Exploit the laws of nature.  The roulette wheel is a mechanical instrument. Over time, the wheel may become unbalanced or the frets separating the numbers may suffer wear and tear. The more a wheel is used, the more worn down it gets—and the more it may privilege certain numbers. In 1873, Joseph Jagger found a wonky wheel at Monte Carlo and bet on the biased numbers. He came away with $400,000—that’s $7.8 million in today’s dough!  5. Go big or go broke.  “The average slot machine is probably two, three times more costly to players than the table games,” says Zender. Avoid them. If you insist on cranking a handle, focus on slots that cost $5 or more and play the max bet. On penny slots, the odds are jacked up in the house’s favor by 15 to 20 percent. You might as well toss those coins in a fountain. Don’t forget to make a wish.  6. Don’t play Keno.  Really, just don’t. Your chances are terrible. At some casinos, the house has a 35 percent edge. No gambler has ever matched all 20 numbers on a 20-spot ticket. The odds of it ever happening are 1 in 3,535,316,142,212,174,336. (That’s 3.5 quintillion!)  7. Practice makes perfect.  If there’s an exception to the adage that the house always wins, it’s in video poker. Typically, the house has only a 0.46 percent advantage (while some versions lean in the gambler’s favor). The pay table is posted right on the machine, and the payoff is high. The catch? To cash out, you need to play at an expert level. Casinos make profits on video poker because most players simply aren’t skilled enough. So study up.  8. Stay away from the light.  “Ninety percent of the people who walk into a casino have no idea of the odds stacked against them,” Zender says. But if you know what you’re looking for, it’s easy to see where the odds are the worst. Casinos make the games with the lousiest odds the most attractive by amping them up with flashing lights and bright colors. At craps, for instance, the craziest bets—“the Field,” “Any 7”—are the most colorful. So as a general rule, to better your odds, stick to the drab side of the room.  9. Invest in a nice watch.  There’s a reason you probably won’t see any clocks or windows on the house floor. Casinos want you to lose track of time so you play for as long as possible. Some casinos prohibit dealers from wearing watches for that reason. Once you’re up a bit, it might be a good time to leave the floor and go treat yourself to a new timepiece.  10. Buy your own drinks.  The truth is, nothing is free—and that includes the free booze. Each casino has something they call a “player reinvestment” fund. It predicts the amount of money you’ll lose and then returns a cut of that in the form of comps, which, to the casual floor visitor, means watery well cocktails. The worse your odds, the better your chances of landing a free drink. Cheers!

"You're too fat to be an astronaut," he once told a boy sharing his dream of space travel.  British media who delighted in quoting him are still lamenting the 96-year-old's recent retirement from public duties. But the people of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu are likely to be optimistic he'll now have the time to join them: They worship him as a god and have based a religion on him.  Followers of the Prince Philip Movement, which started in the 1960s, believe that the prince was born to fulfill an ancient prophecy: that the son of an ancient mountain spirit would one day take the form of a pale-skinned man, travel abroad, marry a powerful lady, and eventually return to the island. When villagers saw the prince’s portrait, they felt the spirit in it, and when he visited Vanuatu in 1974, they were convinced.  Chief Jack Naiva, a respected warrior in the culture, greeted the royal yacht and caught sight of Philip on board. "I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform," Naiva once said. "I knew then that he was the true messiah."  True believers assign large world movements to the machinations of Philip. They once claimed his powers had enabled a black man to become president of the United States and that his "magic" had assisted in helping locate Osama bin Laden. The community has corresponded with Buckingham Palace and even sent Philip a nal-nal , a traditional club for killing pigs, as a token of its appreciation. In return, he sent a portrait in which he’s holding the gift.             TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images      The picture is now part of a shrine set up in Yaohnanen in Vanuatu that includes other photos and a Union flag. In May 2017, shortly after the Prince announced his retirement, a cyclone threatened the island—and its shrine. But according to Matthew Baylis , an author who has lived with the tribe, the natives didn't see this so much as a cause for concern as they did a harbinger of the prince's arrival so he can bask in their worship. To date, Prince Philip has not announced any plans to relocate. A version of this story ran in a 2012 issue of Mental Floss magazine.  celebrities  Europe  History  News  politics  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                          John Ueland      arrow   History     How a Single Mom Created a Plastic Food-Storage Empire     BY Jen  Doll  June 6, 2017          John Ueland              On an unseasonably warm day in April 1954, hundreds of women in cowboy hats gathered outside Tupperware’s Florida headquarters to dig for buried treasure. There, in a nearby swampy area dubbed the “Forest of Spades,” 600 shovels stood at the ready. The excitement was palpable. At the appointed signal, the women raced for the roped-off soil, grabbed shovels, and began to hunt frantically for loot.  It was the pinnacle of the inaugural Tupperware Jubilee, a five-day, gold-rush-themed affair celebrating all things Tupperware. No expense was spared: To give the event a Western feel, frontier-style buildings with false fronts had been erected and bulls and horses were trucked in. The women, and a smattering of men, had traveled from all across the country to participate. A collection of Tupperware dealers, distributors, and sales managers, they made the pilgrimage for the motivational speeches, sales instruction, and especially for the bizarre bonding rituals.  For five hours that day, they prospected for mink stoles and freezer units, gold watches and diamond rings. One of them, Fay Maccalupo of Buffalo, New York, dug up a toy car. When she saw the real Ford it represented, she planted her face against the hood and began to weep, repeating, “I love everybody.” Four women fainted and had to be revived with smelling salts. It was understandable, considering that the total cash value of all the prizes buried in the Florida dirt was $75,000.  Presiding over the treasure hunt was the general sales manager of the Tupperware Home Parties division, a 40-year-old woman named Brownie Wise. For hours, she cheered on the ladies from a loudspeaker with an air of royalty. As she watched them hop on shovels and unearth the rewards of their labors, she couldn’t help but feel proud. Wise took satisfaction in seeing her hard work pay off—once again. The jubilee, which she had organized, had all the pizzazz and spirit expected of an official Tupperware event. The media agreed: Network news was there to cover it, and Life magazine ran a photo essay highlighting the excitement and glamour.  Clearly, there’s more to Tupperware than leftovers. The story of the ubiquitous plastic container is a story of innovation and reinvention: how a new kind of plastic, made from an industrial waste material, ended up a symbol of female empowerment. The product ushered women into the workforce, encouraging them to make their own money, better their families, and win accolades and prizes without fear of being branded that 1950s anathema, “the career woman.”  Digging in the dirt for a gold watch may not mesh with today’s concept of a successful working woman, but at the time, the near-religious fervor seen at the jubilees and other Tupperware gatherings demonstrated just how ground-breaking the company’s sales plan was—the product became a multimillion dollar success not by exploiting women, but by embracing and boosting them. All of this was because of Brownie Wise. The story of Tupperware is her story.  Brownie Wise, named for her big, brown eyes, was born in rural Georgia. Her parents divorced when she was young, and as a teen she traveled with her mother, who organized union rallies. While touring the Deep South, Brownie started giving speeches at her mother’s rallies and soon proved to be a gifted and motivating orator. She “awed people,” writes Bob Kealing in his biography Tupperware Unsealed. “[They] were surprised that someone so young could deliver a speech like a pastor.”  Wise was married briefly, but by 27, she was a divorced single mom in suburban Detroit. During World War II, she worked as a secretary at Bendix Aviation, a company that made parts for navy torpedo planes. It was a decent but unfulfilling job. On the side, Wise penned an advice column for the Detroit News, writing under the alter ego “Hibiscus.” A housewife who led an idyllic life with her child and husband in a home called “Lovehaven,” Hibiscus had everything Wise did not. But what Wise did possess was an endless fountain of determination. As she wrote in a journal at that time, “I wanted to be a successful human being.”  It all started with a bad door-to-door salesman. When a Stanley Home Products salesman knocked on her door and proceeded to deliver a terrible sales pitch for cleaning supplies, Wise scoffed that she could do better. At the time, Stanley was experimenting with a peculiar sales model: home parties. A New Hampshire mop salesman had watched his numbers fly through the roof after he invited a bunch of women over for a party that included a mop demonstration. The company encouraged other salesmen to try the strategy, but many of them delegated the party-hosting to their wives. Thinking it’d be a fun job on the side, Wise started selling Stanley products at parties too. Before long, she was making enough money to quit her job at Bendix.  Wise was blessed with the gift of gab, and her special blend of folksy real talk and motherly encouragement helped her rise through Stanley’s ranks. Soon she was in management and hoping to ascend even higher. But those illusions were quashed at a meeting with Stanley head Frank Beveridge, who told Wise she’d never become an executive. Its halls were “no place for a woman,” he said. Wise returned home furious. The rejection lit a fire in her—she vowed that someday, somehow, she would prove Beveridge wrong.  She didn’t know that the key to fulfilling this dream would be in plastic food-storage containers. Wise first glimpsed Tupperware at a sales meeting. One of her coworkers had seen the products gathering dust in a department store and decided to bring them in. At first, Wise didn’t think they were anything special. But when she accidentally knocked a Tupperware bowl off the table, she realized its full potential: Instead of breaking, it bounced.  It seemed like magic. Tupperware was unlike any home product she’d seen before. It was attractive, coming in pastel colors and flexible shapes, almost like art. More importantly, it was functional—no other competing product even came close. Convinced of its potential, Wise traded in her Stanley brooms in 1949 and started throwing parties to sell Tupperware. What she didn’t intend, exactly, was to kindle a revolution.        AP  The most amazing thing about Tupperware wasn’t that it extended the life of leftovers and a family’s budget, although it did both remarkably well. It was, above all, a career maker. When women came to one of Wise’s parties, they were more than just convinced to buy the product— Wise was such a charming host that she persuaded many buyers to also become Tupperware salespeople. The more parties Wise hosted, the more tricks she learned to convert women into Tupperware faithful. Putting people on waiting lists, for instance, made them more eager to buy, so she signed them up regardless of whether the product was available. She also discovered that throwing containers full of liquid across the room made customers reach straight for their checkbooks. Amassing more and more saleswomen, Wise encouraged her followers to do the same. By October 1949, she had 19 recruits, enough to move her supplies out of her house and into a larger warehouse. Driven by the idea of making money simply by throwing parties for friends and neighbors, the women in Wise’s workforce ballooned in number. Soon, other Tupperware parties were taking place across the country. Wise’s team in Detroit was selling more Tupperware than most department stores. This soon attracted the attention of the no-nonsense founder of the Tupperware Corporation, Earl Silas Tupper. Tupperware, true to its name, was Tupper’s masterpiece, and he was counting on it to make his dreams come true. Having grown up in a poor Massachusetts farm family, he had vowed to make a million dollars by the time he was 30. He hadn’t. He did have a host of esoteric inventions—among them, a fish-powered boat and no-drip ice cream cone—under his belt. But with a wife and family to support, he’d concentrated on a practical career in plastics, first at DuPont and then at a company of his own, which made parts for Jeeps and gas masks during World War II. When the war ended, Tupper decided to buy cheap surpluses left over from wartime manufacturing. He figured he’d be able to do something with them. That’s how he ended up with a glob of greasy black polyethylene, a smelly waste product left behind when metal is created from ore. Tupper took it and, after months of trial and error, wrangled the slag into submission, creating a light-weight plastic that refused to break. Tupper dubbed it “Poly-T,” and, taking inspiration from the way paint cans sealed, created a flexible container with a noiseless lid that snapped on. He called the box Tupperware. He patented the seal in 1949 and rolled out 14 products he called the “Millionaire Line.” The only problem? He couldn’t get anyone to buy it. At least not until Wise came along. Her sales record was remarkable—in 1949, she’d rung up $150,000 in orders and was offered a promotion: distribution rights to the entire state of Florida. In the spring of 1950, she moved south with her son, Jerry, and her mother. She found a store space, and by May she’d opened her business and was scouting for new salespeople. Still, not everything was going smoothly. Along with disputes over turf with other distributors, she was constantly contending with botched orders, shipping delays, and product shortages. In March of 1951, Wise had had enough. She called Tupper in a fury. It was the first time they’d spoken, but she was too livid for niceties; she ripped into him immediately. This was hurting not just her bottom line, but also his. Did he not understand how crucial it was that the problems be fixed immediately? Tupper assured her that he’d fix any issues and then asked a favor: He wanted to hear her sales secrets. The next month, the two met at a conference on Long Island and Wise explained her selling technique. It was pointless, she explained, to think that people would see Tupperware on store shelves or in catalogs and want to buy it. Instead, people had to touch it, squeeze it, drop it, seal it. They had to experience Tupperware from a trusted friend or neighbor. She gave a bold prescription for saving Tupper’s business: Ditch department stores altogether and focus entirely on throwing home parties. Tupper took the advice to heart. So much, in fact, that the day after their meeting, he created a new division just for home parties and asked Wise to be the general manager. Wise had reached her goal: She had become an executive. It was a perfect fit, too. She had a stellar track record—she was selling more Tupperware than anyone anywhere—and Tupper was bowled over by her charm. “You talk a lot and everybody listens,” he said. “She was the yin to Tupper’s yang,” Kealing writes. “Where he was fussy and reclusive, Wise lived to mingle with and inspire the dealer workforce.” They were a match made in sales heaven. Or so it seemed.       AP  In 1952, the first full year of Wise’s watch, Tupperware sales rocketed. Wholesale orders exceeded $2 million. During the last half of the year, sales tripled. Tupperware parties did exactly what Wise promised they would, and she became the company’s shining star. That year, Tupper gave her a salary of $20,933.33, more than she had ever made. For her birthday in 1953, he presented her with a gold-dyed palomino horse. Even more remarkably, he gave her the freedom to do practically whatever she wanted. So Wise traveled the country recruiting, presiding over sales conferences, and announcing contests and doling out prizes for incentive—including, sometimes, her own clothes. By the looks of it, most of Wise’s Tupperware recruits fit neatly into the stereotypical role of a proper housewife. But, in reality, they surreptitiously represented a new kind of female empowerment. During World War II, many women had no choice but to enter the workforce. At its end, many of them had no choice but to leave it. Suddenly, selling Tupperware at parties allowed women to straddle both worlds. They were employed, yet they didn’t appear to challenge their husbands' authority or the status quo. This pioneering entrepreneurial model allowed them to inhabit a workforce outside of the one the hustling salesman inhabited, and, in many cases, to do even better than he did. And that power relied specifically on a network of female friends and neighbors. The parties weren’t just a way for women to keep occupied—it was a way they could contribute to their family’s bottom line. Most women who worked outside the home had low-paying jobs in fields like light manufacturing, retail, clerical work, and health and education. The money—committed dealers could bring in $100 or more per week—was a revelation. The opportunity for success was so great that the husbands of some Tupperware ladies left their own jobs to work with their wives. Wise was something of an early Oprah, giving away fantastic prizes, operating in a grass-roots, word-of-mouth fashion and showing rather than telling other women how to succeed in the comfort of their own homes. The fact that she made many women understand the benefits of becoming salespeople, building the brand further, simply made her a fantastic executive. Wise embraced the spirit of female entrepreneurship wholeheartedly. In her prime, she wrote a morale-boosting newsletter called Tupperware Sparks , published a primer called Tupperware Know-How , and had a 52-minute film, A Tupperware Home Party , made as a training tool. She even convinced Tupper to move the company headquarters to Florida. When Tupper bought property in Kissimmee, Wise turned it into a Mecca-like pilgrimage site for Tupperware devotees. Part of the power of Wise’s sales technique, which at times seemed more faith than business, was that it gave the impression that the sky was the limit, and it relied on collective power. This wasn’t just the traditional salesperson’s dog-eat-dog world: Instead, the group was a “family” that helped one another climb to the top. Women who had previously only had their names in print upon birth or marriage were being recognized for their success, with their names, photographs, and accomplishments appearing in Wise’s newsletters. Along with making their own money, they received rewards—top distributors got cars—and the chance to collaborate with other women in a friendly but competitive environment. Wise increased the fervor with her annual jubilees, which had their own rituals, like candlelit graduation ceremonies and group sing-alongs featuring choruses of “I’ve got that Tupper feeling deep in my heart.” “No woman got praised for scrubbing floors,” Elsie Mortland, who became Tupperware’s Home Kitchen Demonstrator, told Kealing in an interview in 2005. “But when they got praised for selling Tupperware, they had something to be proud of.” Wise was the head of the household, and the Tupperware ladies all wanted to be a part of her extended family. Success was limited only by how hard a person was willing to work, a belief that Wise preached passionately. Unfortunately, she had been duped into thinking her boss shared that opinion.       Alamy  As Wise became the face of Tupperware, sales and press continued to skyrocket. In 1954, she was the first woman to appear on the cover of Business Week. But as glowing as the magazine’s profile was, it contained warning signs about the future of her partnership with Tupper. The piece credited Wise and her sales technique with Tupperware’s estimated $25 million in retail sales and seemed to downplay Tupper’s role as president of the company he had created. Tupper had never craved the spotlight; in fact, he was known to use the back door of his office to avoid attracting attention. But he was keen to ensure that his product, not an employee, received the lion’s share of any attention. And somewhere along the way, Wise had started to upstage the plastic containers she helped make famous. After the Business Week article, Tupper wrote a note to Wise that contained a glimmer of the storm that was to come: “However, good executive as you are, I still like best the pictures ... with TUPPERWARE!” The good press continued but, in 1955, after several powerful distributors left the company, sales began to lag. Hard times strained Wise and Tupper’s relationship. By 1956, angry letters were flying back and forth between them, and at one point, Tupper stopped taking Wise’s calls. Her complaints and frank criticisms, previously helpful, had become jabs he couldn’t endure. He also started to believe that she was costing him money, irked that she had her own side business selling self-help books at company events. More to the point, he started to suspect that if he tried selling the company—which he was planning to do—having a female executive would get in the way. Finally, in 1958, Tupper flew to Florida and fired Wise. After a heated legal battle, she received only $30,000 as a settlement. She didn’t own her house and was ordered to vacate. She had no stocks in the company; she didn’t even own many of the clothes she wore. The man she’d helped make a millionaire didn’t seem to care: Tupper ordered her name expunged from the company history and buried the 600 remaining copies of her book in an unmarked pit behind Tupperware’s Florida headquarters. Later that year, he sold the company to Rexall Drug for $16 million, divorced his wife, and bought an island in Central America. He died in Costa Rica in 1983. Wise, on the other hand, tried starting new companies but never achieved the same success she had with Tupperware. She led a quiet life with her horses, pottery, and her son until she died at her home in Kissimmee in 1992. Her influence, however, has not waned. Today, according to the PBS American Experience documentary Tupperware! , the product is sold in about 100 countries, while “every 2.5 seconds, a Tupperware party is held somewhere in the world.” In this respect, the Golden Age of Tupperware hasn’t ended so much as it has solidified. When was the last time you stored food in a plastic container with a sealing mechanism? Tupperware is so much a part of our food culture that we don’t even think about its continuing influence, and yet we still rely on it daily. This story is one of reinvention too: a useless plastic reimagined into something needed, of food being stored in wholly new ways, of women emerging from their kitchens to showcase their worth and proclaim their identities, of sales techniques evolving to embrace the customer, and of the singular character of Brownie Wise, who changed what it meant to be a woman in the workforce. Because of that, as Houston Post writer Napoleon Hill wrote in 1956, “It has been estimated that Brownie Wise has helped more women to financial success than any other single living person.” Early in Wise’s tenure at the company, Tupper presented her with a piece of the raw polyethylene he’d used to make Tupperware. She saw it as poetic proof of his vision: He had created something beautiful from this unappealing glob of plastic, using nothing but imagination and persistence. It was “the best sales story I have ever heard in all my life,” she wrote. She considered “Poly,” as Tupper called it, a prized possession and would have her women touch it for good luck, telling them, “Just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want. Know it’s going to come true, and then get out and work like everything ... and it will!”  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                                SECTIONS     arrow   LIVE SMARTER          LIVE SMARTER   LIVE SMARTER  BIG QUESTIONS  WEATHER WATCH  JOB SECRETS  QUIZZES  WORLD WAR 1  SMART SHOPPING  STONES, BONES, & WRECKS  #TBT  THE PRESIDENTS  WORDS  RETROBITUARIES         arrow   LIVE SMARTER      This Is The Right Way to Load Your Dishwasher         USPS's 'Informed Delivery' Service Will Email You Pictures of the Mail You're Getting Today           13 Amazon Echo Hacks to Get the Most Out of Alexa           MORE LIVE SMARTER                             More from mental floss studios                                MENTAL FLOSS   ABOUT  RSS  CONTACT US  SHOP   ©2018 Mental Floss, Inc.

But before you go, you may want to know which games give you the best chance of winning.  So we went behind the scene at two casinos, and spoke with the game managers, to find out which games give you an edge.   Table Games Your Best Bet  Jay Bean, a Caesar's floor manager, agreed to sit down with us and talk about the games with the best odds.  He said many people don't realize that table games have much better odds than slots. They are intimidated by thoughts of card sharks taking their money, with images of an intense Texas Hold 'Em tournament in their minds, and so they stick with the safe games: the slots. But they are doing themselves a disservice, he said.  Bean's advice? After you've spent some time on the slot machines, move on to the Blackjack table, and start by just observing.   1. Blackjack  Blackjack has the best odds of winning, with a house edge of just 1 percent in most casinos, Bean said. Plus, you are playing against only the dealer, not hooded poker champions.  "Blackjack is one of our easiest games to play," Bean said. "You're just looking for a number that beats the dealer's number without going over 21."  If you're a novice, Bean said to sit down during a less busy time, such as the afternoon, and the dealer will walk you through the game. But the same is not true with poker: You should practice the game with your friends first, at home, Bean said, until you are comfortable with it. Bean said novices are best off passing on the poker tables, where yes, the competition can be tough. You can find out more information about the game of blackjack at the following link:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/ 2. Craps  So from the Blackjack table, he suggests moving on to the dice game Craps, the game with the second best odds, also nearly 50-50.  The Craps table can be a bit intimidating for the beginner with all the boxes on the table, Bean admitted. But it's really not tough, and it has one of your best chances of winning. In the end, all you are really doing is betting on a dice roll. For more information on craps, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/ 3. Roulette  Bean said your next stop should be the Roulette wheel. It's simple, and pays fairly well.  "So you bet on your favorite numbers," Bean said. "The dealer spins, and if your number comes in you win."  If you stick to betting on just Reds or Blacks, you have nearly a 50-50 chance of walking away a winner. If it lands on red when you choose red, you will double your bet, Bean explained.  While it may seem you have an even chance of winning by simply choosing a color, there is one catch that gives the house its edge: the extra green 0 and 00 position on the wheel. It's on all American roulette wheels.  Or, if you feel lucky, play just one number. It's hard to win, but if you do it pays out 36 to 1.  For more information on roulette, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/roulette/ Worst Odds  Your worst odds? The casinos, understandably, did not want to talk about games with poor odds.  So we turned to Forbes Magazine, which in a report about Best Bets at the Casino , said two popular games -- the Wheel of Fortune and the ever-popular slot machines -- have the lowest odds of winning, with a house edge of 10 percent or more.   The Experts Agree  Professor of Analytics Michael Magazine has crunched the numbers, and agreed that blackjack is the best way to go home with money in your pockets. He said if you take a little time to learn the game, you have the best odds of winning.  "You are somewhere between 44 percent to 48 percent in every single hand of winning," he said, noting that no other casino game gives you odds that good.  But Magazine cautioned that he's not promoting gambling, because he said even games with the best odds still favor the house.  "Play it long enough and you will lose. In the long term the house doesn't lose," Magazine said. If You Love The Slots....  Finally, if you really enjoy playing the slots, here is some good information to know, from state casino reports we examined. With slots, the more money you put in per bet, the higher your chance of winning. If you put the max in a penny machine, which is usually around 50 cents, you have much better odds than if you put in 2 cents. In addition, penny slots have the lowest odds, with $1 and $5 slots paying much better.  Always gamble responsibly, and don't waste your money. __________________________ You can learn more about specific odds of slots machines in each state that has casino gambling by visiting the American Casino Guide.

Probabilities vs. Chances in Casino Gambling Published on July 9, 2017 ★ Luis A. Solferino Follow Following Unfollow ★ Luis A. Solferino Sign in to follow this author Casino Executive Random chance plays an important role of every type of gambling game. Skill is the leverage (in terms of knowledge of the rules of the game) you apply to maximize your potential for winning and minimize your potential for losing. No casino gambling game is ever determined by skill alone.We cannot measure random chance and gamblers frequently mistake their knowledge of games’ probability tables for predictive knowledge. Probabilities do not predict anything. If you know the probabilities for the outcome of the next round in a casino game, you can feel more confident about your next action. That is all the probabilities guarantee you.  The casino, on the other hand, uses the probabilities to determine the maximum risk it accepts per round in a game. The casino represents those acceptable risks in terms of the odds they give per wager. The mathematical probability of an event happening is 1 divided by the number of possible events. You add the probabilities for identical events together to compute unique probabilities. But because random chance is used to determine game outcomes, the probabilities have no effect on what happens next. And the odds do not reflect the probabilities.  Why are Chance and Probability not Always the Same  To master probability theory you only need to remember two things:   Probabilities are computed from known data.  Probabilities never predict the future.   Chance is that immeasurable unknown potential for the outcome you desire. We don’t know what the potential for any outcome truly is. We assume that each outcome has a probability that somewhat correlates with the potential. Games can “defy the odds” by performing way outside our expectations. Most gambling experts seem to use blackjack to explain probabilities; these explanations are where we begin to blur the lines between “probability” and “chance”.  Here’s a simple example:  There are four aces in a deck of 52 cards. That means you have a 1-in-13 chance of being dealt an ace from a freshly shuffled deck. That “chance” is based on the probability distribution of the aces.  Why is it okay to use “chance” and “probability” like this?  Except for which card comes next, there are no unknown factors in blackjack games. Only one random factor affects the outcome of deals in blackjack: the shuffling of the cards. If the dealer could choose which card came next, that would add a second random factor to the game.  When only one random factor influences the outcome of a game, the chances for given outcomes occurring tend to converge to their probabilities. We don’t know why that is so. It just seems to be so.  Why Odds are Different from Probabilities  You will often hear people say, “What are the odds of that happening?” Ironically, odds are even less reliable at predicting things than probabilities. If you invert the probabilities for a given type of gambling game, you need to adjust the resulting numbers slightly downwards to determine the odds.  Odds have to be less than inverted probabilities to ensure that casinos make a profit. By paying back less to the players (cumulatively) than the players wager on games, the casinos can make enough profits to stay in business. But whereas the probabilities don’t predict game outcomes the odds limit the amount of risk casinos accept by covering player wagers. From the casino’s point of view the odds are a little more reliable than the probabilities. From a player’s point of view the probabilities are a little more reliable than the odds.  How Odds Become Almost Inverse to the Probabilities  When you don’t know the outcome of the games you play and you need to make a profit the only thing you can do is hedge your bets. You do this by paying prizes as if there were fewer possible outcomes for each game. Of course, casinos step aside from the odds and probabilities altogether in poker rooms and just charge a player’s fee.  Roulette offers a great example of how casinos use the odds in a game to favor themselves. In roulette the odds on a single number bet are 35 to 1, but the probability of winning a single number bet is 1 divided by the number of slots on the wheel (36 to 38). Hence the odds are never the inverse of the probabilities. This way the casino maintains a “house edge” that ensures the casino retains some percentage of player wagers. A game can be designed around any maximum payout. If you want to award a maximum prize of 10,000 to 1 odds then all you need to do is design a game that has more than 10,000 possible outcomes.  Slot Machines Games are More Chaotic than Probabilistic  There are three types of slot games:   The old fashioned mechanical reel games  Class II slot games  Virtual slot games that simulate old fashioned mechanical reel games.   Class II slot games use networked bingo games to determine the outcome of each spin. The reels are adjusted to form a pattern that closely matches the value of the bingo game pattern. Otherwise the maximum number of possible outcomes for a slot game is the product of number of reels and the number of slots per reel.  Mechanical reel slots typically have fewer possible outcomes than virtual slot games. A virtual slot game has several advantages over the mechanical games: the virtual game can use more stops per reel and more reels. The virtual slot games can also change their reels, and some do during bonus games.  Here is how a slot game can pay a 10,000 to 1 prize:  The game uses 3 reels with 22 slots each. This combination produces 10,648 possible outcomes (combinations). The jackpot prize is only awarded for 1 of those 10,648 possible combinations. Henc, the probability of winning the jackpot is 1 in 10,648 but the jackpot only pays odds of 10,000 to 1. Over time the casino should make a profit from this slot game–unless the random factors influencing the outcome of the slot game just accidentally work against the casino.  Two random factors influence how a slot game’s spins are determined:  The first random factor is the mechanism used to spin the reels. In most if not all slot games today this is accomplished by pulling random numbers from a special chip. The chip continually generates new random numbers that are temporarily stored where the game can get them.  The second random factor is when players play the slot game. The slot game may “burn through” a lot of random numbers throughout the day. It only uses numbers when players spin the reels. These dual random factors combined with the large number of possible outcomes make slot games more chaotic than games like blackjack and roulette.   Player Decisions are Always a Random Factor in any Game  Although we do speak of the skill that one can acquire for a game like blackjack or poker, skills have limited direct impact on how these games are won or lost. That may seem counter-intuitive, but it’s simple:  In a card game two players of equal skill are limited by the random shuffling of the cards. A player with greater knowledge of the game is more likely to make better choices than a player with less knowledge of the game. Nonetheless players are not really paid on the basis of what they hold in their hands in card games. They are paid on the basis of how much they bet and who finishes a round with the highest value hand (or in order of value for split pot games).  In video poker, the value of the hand plays a direct role in determining how much the player is paid. Still, the player has to decide which cards to hold or replace in video poker.  In blackjack, the more players there are at a table the more random decisions influence where the next card is dealt. The dealer’s randomness is limited by house rules on where the dealer must stand or draw.  How can we Estimate our Chances of Winning ?  If probabilities don’t predict game outcomes and odds are worse at predicting your chances of winning than the probabilities, how do you assess your chances of winning? Fuzzy logic offers one way forward, where you compare the most likely outcomes with the least likely outcomes. We cannot precisely measure likelihood, but we can measure things that influence it.  We said that chance is that unmeasurable potential for the outcome that you desire. Surely your chances of winning at roulette are better if you take an outside bet than if you bet on a single number. There is less potential variability in the outcome of the game. You cover more numbers with an outside bet at the cost of winning a smaller prize.  And your chances of winning in blackjack are better if you follow the advice of standard probability tables than if you just “wing it” when deciding whether to stand or draw. Again, there is less potential variability in the outcome of the game because you are reducing randomness. But the game’s transparency is balanced by the relatively low prizes you win. You can only affect the randomness of your own choices. Hence, your chances of winning or losing are only partially under your control. But there is another way that you influence your chances of winning, and that is through your money management.  If you only look at the value of the prizes you want to win then playing maximum wagers on every round increases the chance of winning the largest possible prize. In the worst case scenario you lose every round and your stake is quickly depleted. On the other hand if you play to preserve your stake then minimum wagers are the best strategy because you risk the least on each bet.  The following decision table aligns the pros and cons with each strategy:    Maximum Bets                                            Minimum Bets  Better chances of winning more                 Worse chances of winning more  Fewer chances to win                                   More chances of winning  Here the fuzzy logic is obvious. We cannot compute digital probabilities but we know what is more likely to happen based on our money management strategy. We are indirectly inferring our chances of success by measuring that success in terms of possible outcomes, not in terms of the possibility of outcomes. We use the best case scenario to determine the upper bounds of our success and the worst case scenario to determine the lower bounds of our failures.  We can further qualify our chances by looking at mixed strategies:  Maximum Bets                Alternating Max / Min Bets            Minimum Bets  Best chances of                     Median chance of                       Worst chances of  winning more                        winning more                              winning more  Fewer chances to win           Median chances to win               Most chances to win  At this point it should be obvious that we could construct another table with five columns by adjusting the ratio of maximum to minimum bets (3:2 on the left, 2:3 on the right). We could extend this breakdown indefinitely without ever achieving any precision in predictability but improving our prediction in risk assessment. We cannot know in advance which strategy is best but we can decide which strategy we want to pursue.  Summary  Probabilities, odds, and chance are different things, but we use these terms interchangeably. There is really no harm done. Most people intuitively understand both the uncertainty of the outcomes of these games and the value of comparing the odds to the known probabilities.  When you don’t know the probabilities of a game, as when you play slots, then you can still fall back on fuzzy logic to give yourself some options. It’s a good idea to limit those options to no more than say 3 to 5. Too many choices become confusing and overwhelming.  You can use the fuzzy logic model to compare ratios of probabilities and odds instead of maximum to minimum bets. While there are no guarantees you’ll at least understand why your stake is growing or shrinking because you assessed the probabilities, odds, and chances in the best way possible.

In order to keep their doors open, land-based and online casinos are given the legal right by licensing authorities to plan an advantage into the game. Lawmakers and regulators realize casinos must maintain a house edge. This house edge doesn’t assure anything. A gambling establishment could maintain an advantage over the players, but it’s highly probable that the casino is going to win more than it loses.  The probable scenario might not play out in the short term, but over an extended period of time, the results should conform to the mathematical odds. All successful real money casinos operate on the principle that the house edge will make them profits. Like the motor in a vehicle, the house edge should produce revenues at a particular pace. When it does, a gambling house can afford to make the staff’s payroll, pay the utilities, maintain old equipment, buy new equipment, and cover all the various expenses of a gambling operation.  House Edge – An Engine of Profit  Of course, the casino’s profits are really a result of a great many games and machines, each with their own advantage for the operation. The casino sets a house edge on each gaming machine and table game, which all combined create a revenue stream. Management tries to find a balance between setting a house edge large enough to produce substantial profits, but small enough to keep gamblers interested in playing. If games don’t seem fair to the gamblers, they’ll eventually give up and go home. While laws stipulate a maximum limit for the house edge, most casinos set the expected return of their games at a much higher level, to lure players into their venue and keep them satisfied.  In fact, management sometimes offers game with an expected return at 100% or higher, meaning the player (if they’re smart) can expect to win more money than they wager. This is done for promotional purposes, to start a buzz in the gaming community, and should be looked at as an expense much like an advertising budget. Most casinos–especially those lone outfits away from the centers of gambling tourism–see no need to offer such great bargains. Therefore, when you gamble for real money, expect to face a house edge.  Secret Strategies  When the casino has a mathematical advantage over the gamblers, don’t expect to find some strategy which is going to beat that advantage. Though many people will tell you they have a real money gambling system to beat the casino, they don’t. The house edge is a mathematical law which can’t be broken. You might get lucky and beat the house edge for a while. You might get real lucky and beat the casino’s advantage for a long time–or beat it quite badly. If you play long enough, the house edge will beat you every single time. The so-called tricks which seem to beat the odds are nothing more than illusions produced by the random deviations of probability. Probabilistic results have a certain variance, and the house edge is set well within those variations in fortune, so a person can and will get lucky sometimes. Don’t let that fool you into thinking you’ve got a can’t-miss system to beat the dealer. You don’t.  Casino Games  Each game in the casino has a specific set of odds. It pays to know your chances of winning and losing when choosing a game to play. Ultimately, casino gambling is about playing for fun, entertainment, and thrills. Like any form of entertainment, you’re going to pay to be entertained. Unlike movies and football games and concerts, there’s a chance that you’ll have some luck at the gaming tables or slot machines and the gambling will pay for itself. When you play the games with the better odds, your chances of having that happen are greater. Below is an overview of the games and the odds you’ll face.  Texas Hold’em and Other Poker Variants  Poker is special study, because games like Texas hold’em do not pit the player versus the casino. No house edge exists when play Texas holdem, Omaha, or seven-card stud. It’s you against a table full of other individual players. Your skill and luck combine to determine whether you win or lose. This is why professional poker players can exist, because some people are simply better than other people at cards. Once again, that doesn’t assure they’ll win over the short haul. The cards could fall the wrong way and they lose their whole chip stack. But over the course of a pro poker player’s career, if they’re good enough, they’ll win more than they lose. They’ll win enough to play as a career.  Keep in mind that the house gets a “rake”. The rake is a fee or commission on each hand played. The dealer takes a certain amount of each pot, which the players agree to pay to the house for hosting the game, offering a dealer to deal cards, and otherwise officiate the proceedings. Besides this, gamblers often pay the dealer gratuities when they win. It’s considered good etiquette. Because of the rake, a poker player has to win at significantly more than a 100% return on the money they wager in order to be a successful player. So while a house edge doesn’t exist, the same principle applies. Poker is not just a game of chance, but also a game of skill, so it’s possible to beat the rake.  Blackjack  Blackjack has the lowest house edge of all games in the casino, with the possible exception of video poker . Below, I post the house edge for online casinos powered by some of the best UK and European casino software products. These games try to reproduce the brick-and-mortar experience fairly closely, so these conform somewhat to the odds you’ll find in live casinos.  Single-Deck Blackjack – 0.058% Blackjack Switch – 0.17% Vegas Strip Blackjack – 0.34% Atlantic City Blackjack – 0.35% Vegas Downtown Blackjack – 0.38% European Blackjack – 0.39% Multi-Hand Blackjack – 0.63% Double Exposure – 0.69%  I’m hesitant to post these numbers, because I’m afraid readers will skim and assume these are the hard-and-fast, universal odds for these games. Keep in mind that specific rules can change the odds significantly and game managers like to stick in a tricky little rule here or there, which weights the odds further in their favor. Always study the stated rules and have an idea of how these rules variations change the probabilities of the game.  Video Poker  Besides the 21 games above, video poker offers the best expected return of the games in the casino. Like twenty-one, video poker has dozens of game variants, too. With a full-pay loose deuces, deuces wild, or jacks or better video poker machine, you’ll be playing at a positive expectation. Don’t expect to find the full-pay machines too often, though, because it’s less common all the time.  Games of Skill – A Caveat  Games of skill like blackjack and video poker require strategy knowledge and optimal play in order to get the nice house edge. If you make bad decisions, the house edge rises. Blackjack players must study basic strategy charts for their variant of the game, while video poker gamblers must master their game, too. If you don’t have the time, patience, and memorization abilities to make these viable games, you might be better off playing games of chance which have decent odds.  Craps  Of all games which don’t require strategy, craps has the lowest effective house edge. If you play the pass/come bets in craps, the house edge is 1.41%. If you play the don’t pass/don’t come bets, the house edge is 1.35%. A social factor convinced many players to wager the pass/come bets, because if you bet the opposite, you’re betting against the shooter and most other gamblers at their table. While it’s not considered unfriendly, it certainly is considered bad manners if you win and celebrate, because you’re celebrating the other player’s misfortune.  These odds wouldn’t be better than baccarat and certain types of European roulette , except you also receive the option to make “odds” bets in craps. These wagers have a 0% house edge, though they can only be made in certain situations and the casino limits how much you can wager. If you make pass/come bets and take the odds, the house edge lowers to just under 1%. All other wagers in craps have a higher house edge (some much higher), so if you want to play with the best possibilities of winning, never make any other bets in craps.  Baccarat  Baccarat has several variants, so it’s hard to peg the house edge for each in our limited space. Baccarat has a house edge in the 1.40% range, so it’s not a bad bet for a game with no strategy. Of course, “Chemin de Fer” does offer a strategy component, but you won’t find it in many American casinos. Instead, you’ll be play punto banco and mini-baccarat, which have no strategy. If you want to make the optimal plays, always bet the banker hand instead of the player hand (when possible).  Roulette  European roulette has a house edge of 2.70%. If you play European or single-zero roulette with the “la partage” or “en prison” (imprisonment) rules, this lowers the house edge on the even-money wagers to 1.35%. Even-money wagers are the even/odd, black/red, and high/low bets. All others remain the same. French roulette games with the “called bets” or announced wagers have the same odds as the aforementioned European roulette. American roulette has a house edge of 5.26%, so I wouldn’t play this game in most circumstances. If you find double-zero roulette with the la partage or imprisonment rules, the house edge lowers to a manageable 2.63%, but you can still find better games in the casino.  Slot Machines  The odds on slot machines vary a lot. The house edge might be as low as 3%, but it can balloon to 10% or 15% in some places. Never play the slots at the airport, which have the worst odds you can imagine. The 3% house edge is likely to be for high stakes slot machines. Expect a house edge in the 5% to 8% for the most part. If you play a progressive or accumulated jackpot game, the house edge is going to be higher. The machine has to take the money from a lot of gamblers in order to pay off that one gambler with a life-changing jackpot.  Keno  The house edge on keno ranges between 4% and 30%, but expect something closer to the higher number unless you’re in Las Vegas. Unless you have specific information which tells you the keno games have a low house edge, I can’t imagine why someone would prefer to play keno to most other games in the casino.

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back

        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back 
        to Top  Casino 
        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back

        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back

        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

(September 2007)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The mathematics of gambling are a collection of probability applications encountered in games of chance and can be included in game theory . From a mathematical point of view, the games of chance are experiments generating various types of aleatory events, the probability of which can be calculated by using the properties of probability on a finite space of events.

Here are a few examples:   Throwing the dice in craps is an experiment that generates events such as occurrences of certain numbers on the dice, obtaining a certain sum of the shown numbers, and obtaining numbers with certain properties (less than a specific number, higher than a specific number, even, uneven, and so on). The sample space of such an experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for rolling one die or {(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), ..., (2, 6), ..., (6, 1), (6, 2), ..., (6, 6)} for rolling two dice. The latter is a set of ordered pairs and counts 6 x 6 = 36 elements. The events can be identified with sets, namely parts of the sample space. For example, the event occurrence of an even number is represented by the following set in the experiment of rolling one die: {2, 4, 6}.  Spinning the roulette wheel is an experiment whose generated events could be the occurrence of a certain number, of a certain color or a certain property of the numbers (low, high, even, uneven, from a certain row or column, and so on). The sample space of the experiment involving spinning the roulette wheel is the set of numbers the roulette holds: {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0, 00} for the American roulette, or {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0} for the European. The event occurrence of a red number is represented by the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36}. These are the numbers inscribed in red on the roulette wheel and table.  Dealing cards in blackjack is an experiment that generates events such as the occurrence of a certain card or value as the first card dealt, obtaining a certain total of points from the first two cards dealt, exceeding 21 points from the first three cards dealt, and so on. In card games we encounter many types of experiments and categories of events. Each type of experiment has its own sample space. For example, the experiment of dealing the first card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104, if played with two decks). The experiment of dealing the second card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104), less the first card dealt. The experiment of dealing the first two cards to the first player has as its sample space a set of ordered pairs, namely all the 2-size arrangements of cards from the 52 (or 104). In a game with one player, the event the player is dealt a card of 10 points as the first dealt card is represented by the set of cards {10♠, 10♣, 10♥, 10♦, J♠, J♣, J♥, J♦, Q♠, Q♣, Q♥, Q♦, K♠, K♣, K♥, K♦}. The event the player is dealt a total of five points from the first two dealt cards is represented by the set of 2-size combinations of card values {(A, 4), (2, 3)}, which in fact counts 4 x 4 + 4 x 4 = 32 combinations of cards (as value and symbol).  In 6/49 lottery , the experiment of drawing six numbers from the 49 generates events such as drawing six specific numbers, drawing five numbers from six specific numbers, drawing four numbers from six specific numbers, drawing at least one number from a certain group of numbers, etc. The sample space here is the set of all 6-size combinations of numbers from the 49.  In draw poker , the experiment of dealing the initial five card hands generates events such as dealing at least one certain card to a specific player, dealing a pair to at least two players, dealing four identical symbols to at least one player, and so on. The sample space in this case is the set of all 5-card combinations from the 52 (or the deck used).  Dealing two cards to a player who has discarded two cards is another experiment whose sample space is now the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the cards seen by the observer who solves the probability problem. For example, if you are in play in the above situation and want to figure out some odds regarding your hand, the sample space you should consider is the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the three cards you hold and less the two cards you discarded. This sample space counts the 2-size combinations from 47.   The probability model [ edit ]  A probability model starts from an experiment and a mathematical structure attached to that experiment, namely the space (field) of events. The event is the main unit probability theory works on. In gambling, there are many categories of events, all of which can be textually predefined. In the previous examples of gambling experiments we saw some of the events that experiments generate. They are a minute part of all possible events, which in fact is the set of all parts of the sample space.  For a specific game, the various types of events can be:   Events related to your own play or to opponents’ play;  Events related to one person’s play or to several persons’ play;  Immediate events or long-shot events.   Each category can be further divided into several other subcategories, depending on the game referred to. These events can be literally defined, but it must be done very carefully when framing a probability problem. From a mathematical point of view, the events are nothing more than subsets and the space of events is a Boolean algebra . Among these events, we find elementary and compound events, exclusive and nonexclusive events, and independent and non-independent events.  In the experiment of rolling a die:   Event {3, 5} (whose literal definition is occurrence of 3 or 5 ) is compound because {3, 5}= {3} U {5};  Events {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} are elementary;  Events {3, 5} and {4} are incompatible or exclusive because their intersection is empty; that is, they cannot occur simultaneously;  Events {1, 2, 5} and {2, 5} are nonexclusive, because their intersection is not empty;  In the experiment of rolling two dice one after another, the events obtaining 3 on the first die and obtaining 5 on the second die are independent because the occurrence of the second event is not influenced by the occurrence of the first, and vice versa.   In the experiment of dealing the pocket cards in Texas Hold’em Poker:   The event of dealing (3♣, 3♦) to a player is an elementary event;  The event of dealing two 3’s to a player is compound because is the union of events (3♣, 3♠), (3♣, 3♥), (3♣, 3♦), (3♠, 3♥), (3♠, 3♦) and (3♥, 3♦);  The events player 1 is dealt a pair of kings and player 2 is dealt a pair of kings are nonexclusive (they can both occur);  The events player 1 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J and player 2 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J are exclusive (only one can occur);  The events player 1 is dealt (7, K) and player 2 is dealt (4, Q) are non-independent (the occurrence of the second depends on the occurrence of the first, while the same deck is in use).   These are a few examples of gambling events, whose properties of compoundness, exclusiveness and independency are easily observable. These properties are very important in practical probability calculus.  The complete mathematical model is given by the probability field attached to the experiment, which is the triple sample space—field of events—probability function . For any game of chance, the probability model is of the simplest type—the sample space is finite, the space of events is the set of parts of the sample space, implicitly finite, too, and the probability function is given by the definition of probability on a finite space of events:  Combinations [ edit ]  Games of chance are also good examples of combinations , permutations and arrangements, which are met at every step: combinations of cards in a player’s hand, on the table or expected in any card game; combinations of numbers when rolling several dice once; combinations of numbers in lottery and bingo; combinations of symbols in slots; permutations and arrangements in a race to be bet on, and the like. Combinatorial calculus is an important part of gambling probability applications. In games of chance, most of the gambling probability calculus in which we use the classical definition of probability reverts to counting combinations. The gaming events can be identified with sets, which often are sets of combinations. Thus, we can identify an event with a combination.  For example, in a five draw poker game, the event at least one player holds a four of a kind formation can be identified with the set of all combinations of (xxxxy) type, where x and y are distinct values of cards. This set has 13C(4,4)(52-4)=624 combinations. Possible combinations are (3♠ 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ J♣) or (7♠ 7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 2♣). These can be identified with elementary events that the event to be measured consists of.  Expectation and strategy [ edit ]  Games of chance are not merely pure applications of probability calculus and gaming situations are not just isolated events whose numerical probability is well established through mathematical methods; they are also games whose progress is influenced by human action. In gambling, the human element has a striking character. The player is not only interested in the mathematical probability of the various gaming events, but he or she has expectations from the games while a major interaction exists. To obtain favorable results from this interaction, gamblers take into account all possible information, including statistics , to build gaming strategies. The predicted average gain or loss is called expectation or expected value and is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the experiment multiplied by its payoff (value). Thus, it represents the average amount one expects to win per bet if bets with identical odds are repeated many times. A game or situation in which the expected value for the player is zero (no net gain nor loss) is called a fair game. The attribute fair refers not to the technical process of the game, but to the chance balance house (bank)–player.  Even though the randomness inherent in games of chance would seem to ensure their fairness (at least with respect to the players around a table—shuffling a deck or spinning a wheel do not favor any player except if they are fraudulent), gamblers always search and wait for irregularities in this randomness that will allow them to win. It has been mathematically proved that, in ideal conditions of randomness, and with negative expectation, no long-run regular winning is possible for players of games of chance. Most gamblers accept this premise, but still work on strategies to make them win either in the short term or over the long run.  House advantage or edge [ edit ]  Casino games provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or "house", while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called "random with a tactical element." While it is possible through skilful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the house edge or house vigorish ) in a casino game. Common belief is that such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of wheel clocking in Roulette. For more examples see Advantage gambling .  The player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's "true odds", which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 5 times the amount wagered since there is a 1/6 probability of any single number appearing. However, the casino may only pay 4 times the amount wagered for a winning wager.  The house edge (HE) or vigorish is defined as the casino profit expressed as a percentage of the player's original bet. In games such as Blackjack or Spanish 21 , the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player doubles or splits.  Example: In American Roulette , there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). If a player bets $1 on red, his chance of winning $1 is therefore 18/38 and his chance of losing $1 (or winning -$1) is 20/38.  The player's expected value, EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 rounds, play $1 per round, the average house profit will be 10 x $1 x 5.26% = $0.53. Of course, it is not possible for the casino to win exactly 53 cents; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting 10 rounds at $1 per round.  The house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game. Keno can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines can have up to 15%, while most Australian Pontoon games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.  The calculation of the Roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.  In games which have a skill element, such as Blackjack or Spanish 21 , the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as card counting or shuffle tracking ), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as "basic strategy" and is highly dependent on the specific rules, and even the number of decks used. Good Blackjack and Spanish 21 games have house edges below 0.5%.  Online slot games often have a published Return to Player (RTP) percentage that determines the theoretical house edge. Some software developers choose to publish the RTP of their slot games while others do not. [1] Despite the set theoretical RTP, almost any outcome is possible in the short term. [2]  Standard deviation [ edit ]  The luck factor in a casino game is quantified using standard deviation (SD). The standard deviation of a simple game like Roulette can be simply calculated because of the binomial distribution of successes (assuming a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss). For the binomial distribution, SD is equal to       n  p  q      {\displaystyle {\sqrt {npq}}}   , where     n    {\displaystyle n}   is the number of rounds played,     p    {\displaystyle p}   is the probability of winning, and     q    {\displaystyle q}   is the probability of losing. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold. Therefore, SD for Roulette even-money bet is equal to     2  b    n  p  q      {\displaystyle 2b{\sqrt {npq}}}   , where     b    {\displaystyle b}   is the flat bet per round,     n    {\displaystyle n}   is the number of rounds,     p  =  18   /   38    {\displaystyle p=18/38}   , and     q  =  20   /   38    {\displaystyle q=20/38}   .  After enough large number of rounds the theoretical distribution of the total win converges to the normal distribution , giving a good possibility to forecast the possible win or loss. For example, after 100 rounds at $1 per round, the standard deviation of the win (equally of the loss) will be     2  ⋅  $  1  ⋅    100  ⋅  18   /   38  ⋅  20   /   38    ≈  $  9.99    {\displaystyle 2\cdot \$1\cdot {\sqrt {100\cdot 18/38\cdot 20/38}}\approx \$9.99}   . After 100 rounds, the expected loss will be     100  ⋅  $  1  ⋅  2   /   38  ≈  $  5.26    {\displaystyle 100\cdot \$1\cdot 2/38\approx \$5.26}   .  The 3 sigma range is six times the standard deviation: three above the mean, and three below. Therefore, after 100 rounds betting $1 per round, the result will very probably be somewhere between     −  $  5.26  −  3  ⋅  $  9.99    {\displaystyle -\$5.26-3\cdot \$9.99}   and     −  $  5.26  +  3  ⋅  $  9.99    {\displaystyle -\$5.26+3\cdot \$9.99}   , i.e., between -$34 and $24. There is still a ca. 1 to 400 chance that the result will be not in this range, i.e. either the win will exceed $24, or the loss will exceed $34.  The standard deviation for the even-money Roulette bet is one of the lowest out of all casinos games. Most games, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.  Unfortunately, the above considerations for small numbers of rounds are incorrect, because the distribution is far from normal. Moreover, the results of more volatile games usually converge to the normal distribution much more slowly, therefore much more huge number of rounds are required for that.  As the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is practically impossible for a gambler to win in the long term (if they don't have an edge). It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win.  The volatility index (VI) is defined as the standard deviation for one round, betting one unit. Therefore, the VI for the even-money American Roulette bet is       18   /   38  ⋅  20   /   38    ≈  0.499    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {18/38\cdot 20/38}}\approx 0.499}   .  The variance     v    {\displaystyle v}   is defined as the square of the VI. Therefore, the variance of the even-money American Roulette bet is ca. 0.249, which is extremely low for a casino game. The variance for Blackjack is ca. 1.2, which is still low compared to the variances of electronic gaming machines (EGMs).  Additionally, the term of the volatility index based on some confidence intervals are used. Usually, it is based on the 90% confidence interval. The volatility index for the 90% confidence interval is ca. 1.645 times as the "usual" volatility index that relates to the ca. 68.27% confidence interval.  It is important for a casino to know both the house edge and volatility index for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the volatility index tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called gaming mathematicians and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so they outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field.

Probability is a branch of mathematics, and a lot of people have trouble with math. But calculating the odds that something will or won’t happen is a lot easier than you think.  Here are the 14 examples and how they relate to probability.   1. How to calculate the probability of an event   The first concept to understand is that probability is something that applies to random events. It’s a way of measuring mathematically how likely it is that you’ll see a certain event happen or not happen.  And the first thing to know is that a probability is always a number between 0 and 1. I’ll go into that a little bit more in the next bullet point, but for now, you need to understand that an event that will never occur has a probability of 0. An event that will always occur has a probability of 1.     Anything that might or might not happen can be measured with a number between 0 and 1. And that number is easily calculated.   You take the number of ways an event can happen and divide it by the total number of events possible.  Here’s an easy example:  You flip a coin. There are 2 possible outcomes, both of which are equally likely. You want to know the probability of the coin landing on heads. There’s only one way for it to land on heads, so the probability is ½. That can also be expressed as 0.5, 50%, or 1 to 1.  More about that in the next bullet point.   2. Probabilities expressed as fractions, decimals, percentages, and odds   All probabilities are, by their nature, fractions. But there are multiple ways of expressing a fraction. I gave examples in #1 related to the toss of a coin.  Let’s look at a different example. Let’s say that you have a 2-headed coin.  What is the probability that the coin will land on heads?  And what is the probability that it will land on tails?  Since there are 2 heads, you have a 100% chance of getting a result of heads, and a 0% chance of getting a result of tails.  You can also express that as 1/1 (which is just 1). Or you could express it as 1.0. But most people are comfortable expressing it as a percentage.  In Dungeons & Dragons , you use different shaped dice with more or fewer sides than just six. Let’s use a 4-sided die for this example.   What are the odds of rolling a 4 on a 4-sided die that’s numbered 1-4?   There’s only 1 way to get that result, but there are 4 possible results.  Expressed as a fraction, that’s ¼. Expressed as a decimal, it’s 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, it’s 25%. And expressed as odds, it’s 3 to 1. (Odds are expressed by the number of ways it can’t happen versus the number of ways it can.)   3. The probability of a coin toss   Let’s go back to the coin toss example. I’m going to use it as an example for how to calculate the probability of multiple events.  Suppose you want to know the probability of getting heads twice in a row. When you’re calculating the probability of one event happening AND another event happening, you multiply the two probabilities together.  In this case, we have a 0.5 probability of getting heads. 0.5 X 0.5 = 0.25, which is the probability of getting heads twice in a row.  If you look at the total number of possibilities, it’s easy to see why this is the case:   You could get tails twice.  You could get heads twice.  You could get tails on the first toss and heads on the second toss.  You could get heads on the first toss and tails on the second toss.   Those are the 4 options, and only one of them is the desired result.   4. Probability and the rolling of six-sided dice   Let’s look at another probability example using a traditional six-sided die. The die has 6 possible results, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  The probability of any specific one of those numbers coming up is 1/6.  But what if you want to calculate the probability of getting a 1 OR a 2?  When you’re calculating probabilities that use “AND” in the problem, you multiply.  But if you’re using “OR”, you add.  The probability of getting a 1 is 1/6. The probability of getting a 2 is also 1/6.  1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6, which can be reduced to 1/3.  You can also express that as 33.33% or 0.33 or as 2 to 1 odds.   5. Probability in card games   All kinds of probabilities come into play in card games, but they’re all based on a handful of qualities that a deck of cards has.  A standard deck of cards consists of 52 cards. The probability of getting any specific card is 1/52.  The cards are divided into 4 different suits—clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. If you want to know the probability of getting a card of a specific suit, it’s ¼.  The cards are also divided into 13 different ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace.  The probability of getting a card of a specific rank is 1/13.  But one of the interesting things about card games is that the dealing of cards changes the probability of getting subsequent cards.     Here’s an example:   You’re playing blackjack with a single deck, and you’ve been dealt an ace as your first card. What is the probability that the next card will also be an ace?    There are only 3 aces left in the deck. And the deck only has 51 cards left, too.  So the probability is 3/51, or 1/17, or 16 to 1.  Here’s another example:  You’re playing 5 card stud. You have 3 aces and a deuce. You only have one opponent, and he has 4 cards, none of which is an ace.  There is only one ace left in the deck. And there are 44 cards left in the deck.  So the probability of getting the last ace on your next card is 1/44, or 43 to 1.   6. Probability on a roulette wheel   An American roulette wheel has 38 pockets in which the ball can land. The probability of the ball landing in a specific pocket is 1/38. This can also be expressed as 37 to 1.  This is a great example, because it demonstrates how the casino gets its edge over the player. This bet pays off at 35 to 1.  Since the odds of winning are 37 to 1 and the payoff is only 35 to 1, over a long enough period of time, the casino will almost surely win a lot of money on this bet.  And every bet on the roulette wheel offers a payoff that isn’t commensurate with the odds of winning.  I’ll discuss the house edge more later, but let’s look at some of the other probabilities offered on a roulette wheel.  The pockets aren’t just numbered. They’re also colored. 2 of them are green, 18 of them are black, and 18 of them are red.  If you want to know the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket, it’s 2/38, or 1/19, or 18 to 1.  If you want to know the probability of the ball landing in a black pocket, it’s 18/38, or 9/19, or 37 to 18.  The probability of the ball landing in the red pocket is the same.  You can also place bets on whether the ball lands on an odd or even number. The 0 and the 00 (the green pockets) qualify as neither. So the odds of winning odd or even are the same as winning a bet on black or red.  Those are just some examples. There are a dizzying number of roulette bets you can place.   7. How the house edge works in a casino game   The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to win over the long run. The easiest way to calculate this number is to assume that someone is playing for $100 a bet, and determining how much he’ll lose on average over the long run, then divide that into the number of bets.  I’ll use roulette as an example again, because it’s illustrative.  You place 38 bets on a single number at the roulette table. If you had a mathematically perfect set of spins (which is what you want to assume when you’re calculating the house edge), you’ll win once and lose 37 times.  The winning bet pays off at 35 to 1, so you’ll win $3500 on it. But you’ll lose $3700 on the 37 losing spins. Your net loss is $3700 – $3500, or $200.  If you divide $200 by 38, you get $5.26 per spin, which is your average loss per spin.  That is the house edge for the game—5.26%.     It’s important to remember that the house edge is a long term mathematical expectation. In the short term, anything can (and often will) happen.   But once you get into tens of thousands of results, you’ll start to see the actual results trending toward the expected results.  The casino relies on the law of large numbers for their business model. Players are hoping to have the occasional short-term run of luck. The casino knows that these short-term runs of luck are more than compensated for by the actual expected results on all the other bets being placed constantly throughout the casino.   8. Why betting systems don’t work   There’s a big difference between a betting system and a gambling strategy. A betting system is a method of increasing and reducing your bets based on your previous results. These betting systems don’t work because they rely on the gamblers fallacy.  The gamblers fallacy is the belief that previous events somehow affect the probability of future events. In the case of truly independent trials, previous results have no effect.     Here’s an example:   You’re playing roulette, and you’ve noticed that the ball has landed in a red pocket 8 times in a row. What is the probability that it will land in a red pocket on the next spin? Since there are still 38 pockets, and 18 of them are still red, the probability is the same—18/38.    This is not to be confused with the question of what the probability is that the ball will land on red 9 times in a row. That’s a different question. You’re not placing a bet on whether or not the ball is going to land on red 9 times in a row. You’re placing a bet on the next spin, which is an individual event.  A lot of gamblers have trouble with the concept of independent events.  So they create betting systems which assume that these previous results affect future results.  The classic example is the Martingale System .   9. Examples of the gamblers fallacy   The Martingale System is the classic example of a betting system based on the gamblers fallacy .  The idea is simple enough. You place a single bet on red or black at the roulette table. If you win, you pocket your winnings. If you lose, you double your bet on the next spin. If you win that time, you’ve profited a single unit.  If you lose again, you double your bet again.  This is called a progressive betting system because your bets grow progressively larger.  But in the long run, it doesn’t work.  One of two things will happen if you use this system long enough:   You’ll run into a losing streak long enough that you won’t be able to afford the next bet in the progression.  You’ll run into a losing streak long enough that the casino won’t let you bet enough to cover your losses.      Here’s an example of the Martingale System in action:   You bet $5 on black. You lose. You then bet $10 on black. You lose again. You then bet $20 on black. You lose again. You then bet $40 on black. This time you win. You’ve lost $35 up to this point, so your net win is $5 (your original betting unit).    What most players seem to lose sight of is how easy it is to run into a streak—it happens more often than they think.  Here’s what the progression looks like:   $5  $10  $20  $40  $80  $160  $320  $640  $1280   Let’s assume you’re playing at a casino with a maximum bet of $500. This means that if you lose 7 times in a row, the casino won’t let you place a large enough bet to continue your system.  How often does this happen?  More often than most gamblers think.  The odds of getting the same color 7 times in a row are easily calculated.  The odds of getting a red result are 18/38, or 47.36%.  47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% = 0.534%.  That’s half a per cent, or about once every 200 times the progression is played.  In the short run, a gambler using the Martingale guarantees that he’ll never see anything but occasional small wins.  In the long run, a gambler using the Martingale will eventually run into a streak of bad luck which will wipe out all his winnings.   10. Probabilities in blackjack   Blackjack is one of my favorite examples of probability in action. That’s because, unlike roulette, the deck of cards has a memory. Every time a card is dealt in a game of blackjack, the composition of the deck changes. This means the odds change.  This is why card counters are able to get an edge. They have a means of tracking these changes in the composition of the deck.     Here’s a classic example:   You’re playing in a single deck blackjack game, and you’ve noticed that all 4 aces have already been dealt. What is the probability that you’ll get a blackjack? Since a blackjack is made up of an ace and a card valued at 10, and since there are no aces left in the deck, the probability of getting a blackjack is 0%.    But you can calculate the probability of getting a blackjack from a fresh deck of cards, too.  You’re calculating the probability that you’ll get an ace on the first or the 2 nd card. There are 4 aces in the deck, so your probability is 4/52. That becomes 1/13 when you reduce it. Since this is an “or” question, we add those together:  1/13 + 1/13 = 2/13  But now you get to the “and” part of the problem. You need an ace AND a 10. There are 16 cards in the deck worth 10: the king, the queen, the jack, and the 10.  Your odds of getting a 10 for your other card are 16/51.  16/51 X 2/13 = 32/663. That equates to 4.83% of the time, which is about 5%.  5% is the same thing as once every 20 hands, so you have an approximate idea of how often you’ll get a blackjack.   11. Probabilities in video poker and slot machines   One of the great things about video poker is that even though it looks like a slot machine, it’s NOT a slot machine.  Here’s why that’s great:  Slot machines are the only game in the casino that have opaque math behind them. In other words, you have no way of knowing what the odds and/or payouts are on a slots game.  Yes, slots have pay tables. So you know what the payoffs are for various combinations of symbols on the reels.  But you have no way of knowing what the probability of getting a particular symbol on a reel is.  If you DID know this, you could calculate the probability, the house edge, and the payback percentage.  Here’s an example:  You’re playing a game with lemons as one of the primary symbols. The probability of getting a lemon on each reel is 1/10. If you get 3 lemons, you win 900 coins.  The probability of getting 3 lemons is 1/10 X 1/10 X 1/10, or 1/1000. In odds terms, that’s 999 to 1.  (Remember, to calculate probability when the question includes the word “and”, you multiply. Here, you want to know the probability of getting a lemon on line 1 AND on line 2 AND on line 3.)  Let’s assume this is a high roller game and that you’re betting $100 per spin.  You make 1000 spins. On 999 of those spins, you lose $100, for a total loss of $99,900. On 1 of those spins, you win 900 coins, or $90,000. Your net loss is $99,900 – $90,000, or $9900.  Average that out over 1000 spins, and you’ve lost an average of $9.90 per spin.  So the house edge on this game is 9.9%. The payback percentage is what casino people look at when dealing with gambling machines, though. That’s just 100% less the house edge—in this case, 90.1%. It represents the amount of each bet that the casino gives back to the player, rather than the amount it gets to keep. It’s also sometimes referred to as return to player.  The casinos and slot machine designers know these odds. They designed the game. But since the games are powered by a random number generator, they’re the only people who know these odds. If the game were mechanical, you’d be able to calculate the odds just by knowing the number of symbols on each reel, because each symbol would have an equal probability of turning up.  But a lemon might be programmed to come up once every 12 spins, or once every 15 spins, or once every 20 spins. There’s just no way to know.  Video poker, on the other hand, duplicates the probabilities you’d find in a deck of cards. Not only do you know what each combination of cards pays off at. You also know the probability of getting each combination.  You can use that information to calculate the house edge and the payback percentage for the game.     Here’s an example:   We know that in a standard Jacks or Better game with a 9/6 pay table that a pair of jacks or higher pays off at even money. You’ll see that hand about 21.5% of the time. So the expected value (the payback percentage) for that particular hand is 1 X 21.5%.    You can do that same calculation for every possible hand. You multiply the amount you stand to win by the probability of getting the hand. Then you add up all the possibilities to get the overall payback percentage for the game.  And the great thing about video poker is that the payback percentages are almost always higher than for slot machines.  The other great thing about video poker is that you have a certain amount of intellectual stimulation that isn’t present during a slot machine. You have to decide how you play each hand. Playing them correctly increases your chances of winning.   12. How to calculate expected return   The expected return of a bet is how much you expect that bet to be worth. If it’s worth more than you’re risking, then it’s a positive expectation bet. Otherwise, it’s a negative expectation bet. Gamblers sometimes use +EV or -EV as a shorthand for this.  Here’s how you calculate what a bet is worth:  You take the probability of losing and multiply it by the amount you’ll lose. Then you take the probability of winning and multiply it by the amount you’ll win. You subtract one from the other, and you have your expected return.  It’s that simple.  Let’s use roulette as an example (again).  You place a $100 bet on a single number. If you win, you get $3500. If you lose, you lose $100.   Sounds like a pretty good deal at first glance, doesn’t it?   But let’s do the math.  There are 38 numbers on the roulette wheel, so the probability of winning your bet is 1/38. The probability of losing your bet is 37/38.  1/38 X $3500 = $92.11  37/38 X -$100 = -$97.37  The difference is $5.26. And since the negative number is greater, that’s the amount you expect to lose. The expected value of that bet is -$5.26.  You can use this kind of calculation in life, too. I’ll talk about that more later.   13. How to invent a casino game   The trick to inventing a casino game is to come up with something that looks like a fair bet but isn’t. If you’re too obvious about putting the odds in favor of the casino, no one will want to play.  Let’s use a bet on a coin toss as an example.  Suppose you run a casino, and you offer to pay 25 cents to anyone who correctly guesses the correct result on a coin toss. Here’s how you get your edge—you make the player put up 50 cents in order to win that quarter.  The casino has an obvious large edge in that situation, even if you don’t know how to do the math. But we do know how to do the math, so let’s look at it:  You have a 50% chance of winning 25 cents.  You also have a 50% chance of losing 50 cents.  50% of 25 cents = 12.5 cents  50% of -50 cents = -25 cents  Your expected value is -12.5 cents. Your expected loss on every bet is 12.5 cents. Since you’re betting 50 cents on every bet, the house has an edge of 25%.  That’s huge.  But let’s see if we can make the game a little more interesting.  Let’s say you have to bet a dollar, minimum.  This time, you toss a coin and so does the casino. If one of you gets heads and the other one gets tails, the party with heads is the winner. The party with tails is the loser.  And let’s say this game offers an even money payout.  Looks like a break even game, doesn’t it?  It is, but what do we do in the event of a tie?  What if you both get heads?  What if you both get tails?  If you want to give the casino an edge, you just add a rule that if you both get heads, the game is a push. Your bet is returned, but you don’t win anything.  But if you both get tails, the casino still wins.   What kind of house edge would this game have?   Let’s look at the probabilities involved:  You have the following potential outcomes, all of which are equally likely:   You both get heads.  You both get tails.  You get heads, and the house gets tails.  The house gets heads, and you get tails.   So you have a 25% chance of a push, which has a net effect of 0. (You don’t win anything, but you don’t lose anything, either.)  You have a 25% chance of winning a dollar, which is an expected value of 25 cents.  You have a 25% chance of losing a dollar, which is an expected value of -25 cents.  And you have a 25% chance of losing a dollar, which is an expected value of -25 cents.  The house still has a 25% edge, but it isn’t nearly as obvious now, is it?  The house could make the game even more fair by returning half your bet in the case of both of you getting tails. That would reduce the house edge to 12.5%, which is better but not great.  Another option would be to take any tie result and have 2 options:   You could put up another dollar in order to get another coin toss.  You could just surrender your bet.   The catch is if you put up the other dollar and win, you only get $1 in winnings. But if the casino wins, you lose both dollars.  And in fact, this is almost exactly how casino war works.  That’s just a simplified version of how to create a new casino game. You could have multiple bets, multiple payouts, and multiple probabilities for each outcome. You just have to look at the expected value of all of them to determine how much of an edge the house.  Then you have to test the game in front of a live gambling audience to see how they respond. If the gamblers don’t like the game and refuse to play, you don’t have a potential casino game at all.     The house wins nothing if no one likes the game.    14. Using probability in real life   This is the most important section of the post, actually. You can use your knowledge of probability to make decisions in real life that are better than the decisions of most people.     Here’s an example:   You work at a job making $50,000 a year. You decide to take a job making $200,000 a year, even though you estimate that there’s a 25% chance of the company paying you $200,000 a year going bankrupt after your first year of employment. The expected value of that decision is simple enough.    But let’s look at a more day-to-day practical application. Suppose you’re considering parking in a handicapped spot.  The probability of getting a ticket for this might be 20%, and the parking ticket might be $200. That’s an expected loss of $40.  But parking in that spot will save you half an hour of walking, and you’re a highly paid consultant earning $250 per hour. That means your time is worth $125 per half hour.  Since your time is worth well over $40, it makes financial sense to take the risk.  Of course, that example ignores any moral implications involved. You might have a moral problem with taking up a parking spot intended for a handicapped person.  Here’s another practical example:  You’re obese, and you’re 45 years old. According to the doctor, your life expectancy if you don’t lose weight is 60 years old. But if you have weight loss surgery, your life expectancy becomes 68 years old.  But you also have a 1 in 800 chance of dying during the weight loss surgery.   What’s the correct decision, mathematically?   Let’s assume that the life expectancy numbers are absolute certainties, because that makes the math easier to do.  You have a 100% chance of dying 15 years earlier if you don’t use the surgery. That’s -15 years.  You have a 799/800 chance of gaining 18 years if you have the surgery. That’s an expected gain of +17.98 years.  You also have a 1/800 chance of dying 30 years earlier (at age 45). That’s another -0.04 years in expected loss.  17.98 – 15 – 0.04 = 2.94 years of expected additional life.  And chances are, you’ll enjoy life more during that time. You’ll be able to engage in more activities, find more people to date, and require less medical attention.  The net positive outweighs the negative, even though the calculations seems pretty close.  You can make the math even more complicated by factoring in the possibility that you could lose the weight without surgery. But we don’t need to get into that much detail; we just wanted to look at how this type of thinking (probability based) can be applied to real life issues to make better decisions.)   Conclusion   You can find an almost unlimited number of gambling probability examples to discuss. But all of them start with the notion that probability is always a number between 0 and 1. The other thing to remember in probability problems is the difference between “or” and “and”. If you want to know the probability of this happening OR that happening, you add the probabilities of each together. If you want to know the probability of this happening AND that happening, you multiply the probabilities by each other.  You can multiply the probability of winning by the amount you win and compare it with the probability of losing and the amount you’ll lose to get the expected value of any bet. In casino games, the edge is always with the house, although the way they present the games is subtle.     It’s not always clearly obvious how the casino gets it mathematical edge over the player. But it’s always there, unless you’re a card counter or expert video poker player.

Obama's Deal  The Vaccine War  WATCH SCHEDULE TOPICS ABOUT FRONTLINE SHOP TEACHER CENTER                      The odds in a lottery are worse than other forms of gambling.  But those other forms are also slanted toward the people running the games. Casinos have something called the vig (short for vigorish), the advantage the house enjoys on all so-called "even money" and "true odds" bets, on which you're paid, respectively, what you've bet on or an amount proportional to your risk. In horse racing, you bet against everyone else at the track, and, typically, the house takes 17 percent of all money bet.  With breakage (the house rounds every payoff down to the nearest dime), add another two percent.  That's 19 percent you have to overcome before breaking even.    These numbers are the percentages of defeat built into every casino game, sports game, or horse race you bet.  They are the odds stacked against players.  If you're betting $100 an hour on roulette, you will, in the long run, lose an average of $5.26 an hour. Craps is extremely complicated-- but much of its fascination lies in its complexity.  In the game, one player-- the shooter-- throws a pair of dice and bets, along with other players at the table, on specific numbers turning up. On the shooter's first roll, the wager-- called a pass line bet-- is on whether he'll throw either 7 or 11 (a win) or 2, 3, or 12 (a loss).  If he hits 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes his point; your original wager is then on whether he'll roll that number again before he throws a 7. After making a pass line bet, when a point has been established, you can make an odds bet.  You do this by placing another bet-- equal to one, two...up to ten times the original bet-- on the point number.  The casino will pay true odds on this second bet, based n the probability of the point number coming up. These true odds bets reduce the house's edge in craps to less that 1 percent.  Next to blackjack played with extreme discipline, this is the best bet you'll have in casino. The odds on slot machines are terrible.  Casinos make two thirds of their profits from slots.  But smart gamblers avoid slots as surely as they do Lotto machines. Roulette, in which you're betting on whether a ball spinning above a wheel will land on a certain number, group of numbers, or color, has a simplicity that makes it a perfect game for anyone wishing to meet destiny face-to-face. In addition to the numbers 1 through 36, the roulette wheel has the numbers 0 and 00, which gives the house a 5.26 percent advantage on all bets-- a significant edge. Most people believe that Blackjack, the casino version of the card game 21, is the easiest and best game to play in a casino.  Depending on how you play, this can be true. The object of the game is to take card that bring you close to a total of 21 without going over.  Face cards count as 10.  Aces count as either 11 or 1. Each player at a blackjack table plays only against the dealer-- not other players.  If a player takes too many cards and goes over 21, he or she loses.  If the dealer takes too many cards, the players all win.  Otherwise, if your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win. You bet your money before you see any cards.  In some situations, you can raise your bet after seeing your first two cards.  When you win, you are paid 2 to 1.  If you get a Blackjack-- an ace and any card worth ten-- you win a slightly higher multiple of your bet. The most popular way to play Blackjack is the so-called "perfect strategy."  Based on the law of large numbers, which states that averages and tendencies gain strength over time , the perfect strategy was derived by computers simulating millions of twenty-one hands.  It results in some counter-intuitive rules.  Two examples:  You have sixteen, the dealer is showing a ten.  The chart says hit.  You'll lose 75% of the time.  If you don't hit, you'll lose 77% of the time.  Twice in one hundred-- in a game in which the dealer shouldn't beat you more than 51 hands per hundred-- is a huge margin.  You have a pair of aces or 8's, and the dealer is showing a ten.  The chart says split-- despite the impulse to keep one bad hand rather than making two. Played correctly, this system assures you of being at no more than a 2 percent disadvantage against the casino.  In practice, the house wins at a rate ten times higher-- because few players follow the perfect strategy...perfectly. For example, the perfect strategy demands that you always split second pairs and "double down" (double your original wager by placing a second bet next to your original on the table) when you're supposed to.  Most players prefer to follow their instincts. Some players prefer to count cards as they are played at the Black jack table, adjusting their bets according to how many tens and aces are left to be played in a given hand. In the more complicated card-counting system:  7's and 8's are considered neutral and aren't counted;  2 through 6 are counted as negative 1;  9's, 10's, and Aces are counted as 1.  A simpler version counts 9's and 10's in one column, aces in another, and hands played on your fingers.  A high (or minus) deck-- with a good half of the deck dealt and a large number of aces still unplayed-- favors the player.  When the count is high, you should increase your bets.

Show Caption  Hide Caption            Previous     Next                                 Many people will be visiting a casino this summer, whether on a trip to Vegas, on a cruise ship, or just at a local casino during a "staycation." But before you go, you may want to know which games give you the best chance of winning.  So we went behind the scene at two casinos, and spoke with the game managers, to find out which games give you an edge.   Table Games Your Best Bet  Jay Bean, a Caesar's floor manager, agreed to sit down with us and talk about the games with the best odds.  He said many people don't realize that table games have much better odds than slots. They are intimidated by thoughts of card sharks taking their money, with images of an intense Texas Hold 'Em tournament in their minds, and so they stick with the safe games: the slots. But they are doing themselves a disservice, he said.  Bean's advice? After you've spent some time on the slot machines, move on to the Blackjack table, and start by just observing.   1. Blackjack  Blackjack has the best odds of winning, with a house edge of just 1 percent in most casinos, Bean said. Plus, you are playing against only the dealer, not hooded poker champions.  "Blackjack is one of our easiest games to play," Bean said. "You're just looking for a number that beats the dealer's number without going over 21."  If you're a novice, Bean said to sit down during a less busy time, such as the afternoon, and the dealer will walk you through the game. But the same is not true with poker: You should practice the game with your friends first, at home, Bean said, until you are comfortable with it. Bean said novices are best off passing on the poker tables, where yes, the competition can be tough. You can find out more information about the game of blackjack at the following link:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/ 2. Craps  So from the Blackjack table, he suggests moving on to the dice game Craps, the game with the second best odds, also nearly 50-50.  The Craps table can be a bit intimidating for the beginner with all the boxes on the table, Bean admitted. But it's really not tough, and it has one of your best chances of winning. In the end, all you are really doing is betting on a dice roll. For more information on craps, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/ 3. Roulette  Bean said your next stop should be the Roulette wheel. It's simple, and pays fairly well.  "So you bet on your favorite numbers," Bean said. "The dealer spins, and if your number comes in you win."  If you stick to betting on just Reds or Blacks, you have nearly a 50-50 chance of walking away a winner. If it lands on red when you choose red, you will double your bet, Bean explained.  While it may seem you have an even chance of winning by simply choosing a color, there is one catch that gives the house its edge: the extra green 0 and 00 position on the wheel. It's on all American roulette wheels.  Or, if you feel lucky, play just one number. It's hard to win, but if you do it pays out 36 to 1.  For more information on roulette, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/roulette/ Worst Odds  Your worst odds? The casinos, understandably, did not want to talk about games with poor odds.  So we turned to Forbes Magazine, which in a report about Best Bets at the Casino , said two popular games -- the Wheel of Fortune and the ever-popular slot machines -- have the lowest odds of winning, with a house edge of 10 percent or more.   The Experts Agree  Professor of Analytics Michael Magazine has crunched the numbers, and agreed that blackjack is the best way to go home with money in your pockets. He said if you take a little time to learn the game, you have the best odds of winning.  "You are somewhere between 44 percent to 48 percent in every single hand of winning," he said, noting that no other casino game gives you odds that good.  But Magazine cautioned that he's not promoting gambling, because he said even games with the best odds still favor the house.  "Play it long enough and you will lose. In the long term the house doesn't lose," Magazine said. If You Love The Slots....  Finally, if you really enjoy playing the slots, here is some good information to know, from state casino reports we examined. With slots, the more money you put in per bet, the higher your chance of winning. If you put the max in a penny machine, which is usually around 50 cents, you have much better odds than if you put in 2 cents. In addition, penny slots have the lowest odds, with $1 and $5 slots paying much better.  Always gamble responsibly, and don't waste your money. __________________________ You can learn more about specific odds of slots machines in each state that has casino gambling by visiting the American Casino Guide.

Win It.                   The Best and Worst Bets in the Casinos  Knowing which is which can help make you a winner by Frank Scoblete  This article began innocently enough. My editor, Len Butcher, sent me the following email: “Frank, I need a piece on the top 10 best and worst casino bets for the December Casino Player issue. Deadline is October 16. Thanks, Len.”  This should be a snap, I thought. I can write this in my sleep. I immediately thought of the worst game, Keno, where the house edge is about 25 percent—which means you lose about 25 cents for every dollar you bet at the game. Surely that would be at the top of the list for the worst bets you can make in a casino.  So I started writing, but then it dawned on me that something was amiss. In Keno, playing every game, maybe four games an hour at some casinos, betting one dollar, you lose about a dollar per hour. Now if we take a good bet like mini-baccarat’s “bank” bet (which has a 1.06 percent house edge) and you bet $10 per decision, and play 150 decisions (which is not unheard of), then you’d lose a whopping $15.90.   So which is the worse bet? In terms of the house edge, it’s Keno. But speed-wise, mini-baccarat is worse. Then I realized there’s another consideration. Some games are just not found in a lot of casinos. Some of the worst bets in all of casino history are at Sic Bo—where the house edge can soar into the 40 percent range. Should I count these bets among the worst, even if you might never see a Sic Bo game in your life?  And what about video poker, where there are so many machines that the entire article could be about these games?  To keep things simple, in this article I will use the “house edge” as the primary criteria of judgment, but I will mention the speed of the games as well, to give you a more complete picture. And I will limit my list to games that are found in almost all casinos. There are even worse bets out there, but they’re games that haven’t made it to most casinos (thankfully).  As for video poker, I’m not mentioning it among the “best bets” although some video poker machines can be positive expectation games if played properly, and others have house edges of between one-half and one percent or so. I’m limiting this list to table games; finding and playing the right video poker machines is another story unto itself. And, finally, I’m not going to bother mentioning the various “side bets” you’ll occasionally see at the tables. These bets come in many different forms, but they’re almost always a bad idea. Avoid them.  With that said, here we go—the worst first.  The 10 Worst Bets  1. Keno Yes, this is probably the worst bet you will find in most casinos. The average house edge hovers around 25 percent, which is better than state lotteries, but that’s not saying much. Still, the pace of the game is slow and if you only make one bet per game you won’t lose much money.  2. Any Seven (Craps) This is a one-roll bet that the next number rolled will be a seven. The house edge is a monstrous 16.67 percent. If you make this bet on every roll, even if you only wager a measly dollar, you can lose about $20 per hour!  3. Progressive Slot Machines Yes, those gigantic multi-million dollar jackpots sure are tempting, but progressive games are the very worst machines in the casino—no matter what the denomination is. The house edge ranges from 12 to 17 percent. This means you lose between $12 and $17 for every $100 you wager in the long run. Making the situation even more brutal is the fact that people tend to play these games very fast. How much can a $1 slot player lose on an inter-casino linked progressive? Upwards of almost $400 per hour. Yikes!  4. Tie Bet at Baccarat This bet comes with a house edge of around 14 percent. With traditional baccarat, played in the high roller rooms, the game is relatively slow; at mini-baccarat, however, the speed of the game is very fast. This bet is bad in both games.  5. 2 and 12 (Craps) Snake eyes (2) and boxcars (12) have house edges of 13.89 percent. These are one-roll bets for the unwary and unwise craps player.  6. Whirl or World (Craps) This is a multiple number (2, 3, 7, 11, 12), one-roll bet that has a house edge of 13.33 percent. Steer clear of this one.  7. The Horn (Craps) Another multiple number (2, 3, 11, 12) one-roll bet that comes in with a house edge of 12.5 percent. There is a saying, “See a horn, bet a horn.” The real saying should be, “You have to be an idiot to bet the horn.”  8. 3 and 11; Hard 4 and Hard 10; Any Craps (Craps) Ironically, the 11 has an 11.11 percent house edge, as do the rest of these bets. These bets should hold no interest for you, since making them on each and every roll will cost you $11.11 per $100 wagered.  9. 5-Cent Slot Machines The low denomination, non-progressive slot machines also have high house edges—around 10 to 12 percent—and most people play them fast, causing their losses to add up quickly.  10. Hard 6 and Hard 8 (Craps) At this point we’ve left the double-digit house edges behind us, but these two bets are still pretty bad with a house edge of 9.09 percent. They are not active on every roll, which helps a little.  The 10 Best Bets  1. The Pass, Don’t Pass, Come, Don’t Come with Odds (Craps) Some casinos in America are still offering craps games with 100X, 20X, 10X and 5X odds. Here, the house edge is a small fraction of a percent on these games if you utilize the odds bets. Without odds, the house edge on the above bets is about 1.4 percent—still very good. Also, not every roll impacts you, so that’s a good thing too. Most players will be on about 50 percent of the decisions betting this way.  2. Blackjack Basic Strategy If the game you are playing is a traditional blackjack game with the house paying 3 to 2 for blackjacks, with the dealer standing on soft 17, and with the right to double on any first two cards, split and double after splits, the casino will have about a half percent house edge. That means you lose about 50 cents for every $100 wagered—a very good bet indeed. Blackjack is a moderately fast game, but with such a low house edge you still have a very good shot at winning some money on any given session.  3. The Bank Bet at Baccarat The house edge at this bet is 1.06 percent. Remember that traditional, high-roller room baccarat, where the players deal the cards, is a slow game. Mini-baccarat is a fast game.  4. The Player Bet at Baccarat The house edge on this bet is a mere 1.24 percent. See #3.  5. Blackjack Pays 6 to 5 for Natural (Basic Strategy) This new game is three times worse than traditional blackjack, as it pays only $12 to $10 for a blackjack as opposed to $15 to $10. Usually these games also have the dealers hitting their soft 17s. The house edge on these games is around 1.5 percent, depending on the casino’s rules.  6. Place the 6 or 8 (Craps) This bet must be made in multiples of $6. It pays $7 on a win since the house has a 6 to 5 edge on the bet. The house edge is 1.52 percent and the bet is active on 11 of 36 decisions, which means most of the time you will not have your money acted upon.  7. Spanish 21 (Basic Strategy) In this variation of blackjack, the 10-spot cards are removed but there are all sorts of special awards for premium hands built into the rules. With the proper basic strategy, the house edge is around 1.8 percent, give or take, depending on rules of the casino.  8. Three Card Poker There are two games in one here. The main game of ante and wager has about a 2 percent house edge. The secondary game, called Pair Plus, has about a 2.3 percent house edge. The game is relatively fast, so you might want to sit out some hands every so often.  9. Lay the 4 and 10 (Craps) Here, you are betting that the 7 will appear before the 4 or 10. The house edge is 2.44 percent.  10. Caribbean Stud and Pai Gow Poker Two of the first “carnival” card games are still going strong in casinos. The house edge is about 2.5 percent if you play your hands properly. These are relatively slow games.  So there you have it—the worst bets and the best bets you’ll encounter during your next trip to the casino. Good luck, and play smart.  Frank Scoblete is the #1 best-selling gaming author in America.

Win It.                   The Best and Worst Bets in the Casinos  Knowing which is which can help make you a winner by Frank Scoblete  This article began innocently enough. My editor, Len Butcher, sent me the following email: “Frank, I need a piece on the top 10 best and worst casino bets for the December Casino Player issue. Deadline is October 16. Thanks, Len.”  This should be a snap, I thought. I can write this in my sleep. I immediately thought of the worst game, Keno, where the house edge is about 25 percent—which means you lose about 25 cents for every dollar you bet at the game. Surely that would be at the top of the list for the worst bets you can make in a casino.  So I started writing, but then it dawned on me that something was amiss. In Keno, playing every game, maybe four games an hour at some casinos, betting one dollar, you lose about a dollar per hour. Now if we take a good bet like mini-baccarat’s “bank” bet (which has a 1.06 percent house edge) and you bet $10 per decision, and play 150 decisions (which is not unheard of), then you’d lose a whopping $15.90.   So which is the worse bet? In terms of the house edge, it’s Keno. But speed-wise, mini-baccarat is worse. Then I realized there’s another consideration. Some games are just not found in a lot of casinos. Some of the worst bets in all of casino history are at Sic Bo—where the house edge can soar into the 40 percent range. Should I count these bets among the worst, even if you might never see a Sic Bo game in your life?  And what about video poker, where there are so many machines that the entire article could be about these games?  To keep things simple, in this article I will use the “house edge” as the primary criteria of judgment, but I will mention the speed of the games as well, to give you a more complete picture. And I will limit my list to games that are found in almost all casinos. There are even worse bets out there, but they’re games that haven’t made it to most casinos (thankfully).  As for video poker, I’m not mentioning it among the “best bets” although some video poker machines can be positive expectation games if played properly, and others have house edges of between one-half and one percent or so. I’m limiting this list to table games; finding and playing the right video poker machines is another story unto itself. And, finally, I’m not going to bother mentioning the various “side bets” you’ll occasionally see at the tables. These bets come in many different forms, but they’re almost always a bad idea. Avoid them.  With that said, here we go—the worst first.  The 10 Worst Bets  1. Keno Yes, this is probably the worst bet you will find in most casinos. The average house edge hovers around 25 percent, which is better than state lotteries, but that’s not saying much. Still, the pace of the game is slow and if you only make one bet per game you won’t lose much money.  2. Any Seven (Craps) This is a one-roll bet that the next number rolled will be a seven. The house edge is a monstrous 16.67 percent. If you make this bet on every roll, even if you only wager a measly dollar, you can lose about $20 per hour!  3. Progressive Slot Machines Yes, those gigantic multi-million dollar jackpots sure are tempting, but progressive games are the very worst machines in the casino—no matter what the denomination is. The house edge ranges from 12 to 17 percent. This means you lose between $12 and $17 for every $100 you wager in the long run. Making the situation even more brutal is the fact that people tend to play these games very fast. How much can a $1 slot player lose on an inter-casino linked progressive? Upwards of almost $400 per hour. Yikes!  4. Tie Bet at Baccarat This bet comes with a house edge of around 14 percent. With traditional baccarat, played in the high roller rooms, the game is relatively slow; at mini-baccarat, however, the speed of the game is very fast. This bet is bad in both games.  5. 2 and 12 (Craps) Snake eyes (2) and boxcars (12) have house edges of 13.89 percent. These are one-roll bets for the unwary and unwise craps player.  6. Whirl or World (Craps) This is a multiple number (2, 3, 7, 11, 12), one-roll bet that has a house edge of 13.33 percent. Steer clear of this one.  7. The Horn (Craps) Another multiple number (2, 3, 11, 12) one-roll bet that comes in with a house edge of 12.5 percent. There is a saying, “See a horn, bet a horn.” The real saying should be, “You have to be an idiot to bet the horn.”  8. 3 and 11; Hard 4 and Hard 10; Any Craps (Craps) Ironically, the 11 has an 11.11 percent house edge, as do the rest of these bets. These bets should hold no interest for you, since making them on each and every roll will cost you $11.11 per $100 wagered.  9. 5-Cent Slot Machines The low denomination, non-progressive slot machines also have high house edges—around 10 to 12 percent—and most people play them fast, causing their losses to add up quickly.  10. Hard 6 and Hard 8 (Craps) At this point we’ve left the double-digit house edges behind us, but these two bets are still pretty bad with a house edge of 9.09 percent. They are not active on every roll, which helps a little.  The 10 Best Bets  1. The Pass, Don’t Pass, Come, Don’t Come with Odds (Craps) Some casinos in America are still offering craps games with 100X, 20X, 10X and 5X odds. Here, the house edge is a small fraction of a percent on these games if you utilize the odds bets. Without odds, the house edge on the above bets is about 1.4 percent—still very good. Also, not every roll impacts you, so that’s a good thing too. Most players will be on about 50 percent of the decisions betting this way.  2. Blackjack Basic Strategy If the game you are playing is a traditional blackjack game with the house paying 3 to 2 for blackjacks, with the dealer standing on soft 17, and with the right to double on any first two cards, split and double after splits, the casino will have about a half percent house edge. That means you lose about 50 cents for every $100 wagered—a very good bet indeed. Blackjack is a moderately fast game, but with such a low house edge you still have a very good shot at winning some money on any given session.  3. The Bank Bet at Baccarat The house edge at this bet is 1.06 percent. Remember that traditional, high-roller room baccarat, where the players deal the cards, is a slow game. Mini-baccarat is a fast game.  4. The Player Bet at Baccarat The house edge on this bet is a mere 1.24 percent. See #3.  5. Blackjack Pays 6 to 5 for Natural (Basic Strategy) This new game is three times worse than traditional blackjack, as it pays only $12 to $10 for a blackjack as opposed to $15 to $10. Usually these games also have the dealers hitting their soft 17s. The house edge on these games is around 1.5 percent, depending on the casino’s rules.  6. Place the 6 or 8 (Craps) This bet must be made in multiples of $6. It pays $7 on a win since the house has a 6 to 5 edge on the bet. The house edge is 1.52 percent and the bet is active on 11 of 36 decisions, which means most of the time you will not have your money acted upon.  7. Spanish 21 (Basic Strategy) In this variation of blackjack, the 10-spot cards are removed but there are all sorts of special awards for premium hands built into the rules. With the proper basic strategy, the house edge is around 1.8 percent, give or take, depending on rules of the casino.  8. Three Card Poker There are two games in one here. The main game of ante and wager has about a 2 percent house edge. The secondary game, called Pair Plus, has about a 2.3 percent house edge. The game is relatively fast, so you might want to sit out some hands every so often.  9. Lay the 4 and 10 (Craps) Here, you are betting that the 7 will appear before the 4 or 10. The house edge is 2.44 percent.  10. Caribbean Stud and Pai Gow Poker Two of the first “carnival” card games are still going strong in casinos. The house edge is about 2.5 percent if you play your hands properly. These are relatively slow games.  So there you have it—the worst bets and the best bets you’ll encounter during your next trip to the casino. Good luck, and play smart.  Frank Scoblete is the #1 best-selling gaming author in America.

Casinos remain a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. You may be planning a vacation at a popular casino destination, or you might hang around at a local casino over the weekend. Before you go, we want to share with you the casino games which give you the best chance of winning. We examined what casino managers and the pro gamblers have divulged about casino games with the best odds of winning, and here is what we found.  Top Casino Games With the Best Odds of Winning  We found that several of the most popular table games give you the best odds of winning. These games may initially seem intimidating, but with a bit of learning, you will find them easy to understand and play. When you are at a casino the next time, start by observing these games. If it is a slow time at one of the tables, talk to the dealers. Often, dealers will be more than willing to walk you through the rules and discuss basic game strategies to improve your odds of winning.  When comparing the house edge of various casino games, we found these four popular games to have the best odds:   Blackjack  Baccarat  Craps  Roulette   The house edge is defined as the ratio of the average loss a player makes to the initial bet amount. For example, if you play Blackjack with basic strategy, over the long run, the house edge is 0.5%. This means for every $10 you bet, you will lose 5 cents over the long run. With Baccarat or Craps, you will lose less than 10 cents for every $10 you bet. With roulette, depending on the game design, you could lose 27 to 53 cents for every $10 you bet.   Blackjack  Blackjack is one of the easiest games to play in a casino and offers you one of the strongest odds of winning. Without a doubt, it is the most popular table game in the United States. The casino has an edge of less than 1 percent in most cases. Additionally, with Blackjack, you are always playing only against the dealer and not against an unassuming expert gambler who could be sitting right next to you.  How to Play Blackjack  In Blackjack, the objective of the game is to beat the dealer. In order to beat the dealer, you need to get cards that get you close to 21, but not over. While not going over 21, you have to outscore the dealer or have him go bust. Let us discuss the rules of Blackjack.  For number cards, the value of the card is the number itself. Face cards are counted as 10. Ace can count as 11 or 1. If the ace puts you over 21, you count it as 1, or else you count it as 11.  The value of a hand is the total of all the individual cards’ values. The highest hand is a "blackjack,” and it consists of an ace and any card with a value of 10. A Blackjack hand outranks all other hands with a value of 21.   Once all the players have placed their bets, the dealer deals out two cards to each player and to himself. Each player’s cards are both dealt face up. One of the dealer’s two cards is face up, and the other is face down. The face-down card is called a “hole card.”  After the cards are dealt, the play begins with the player to the dealer’s left. If you think getting one or more additional cards will get you at or closer to 21, you ask to draw additional cards with a “hit.” If you go over 21, you are bust. You can “stand” if you do not want any more cards to be drawn. You can also “double” your bet, and you will get one more card but no additional cards after that.  If you have a pair or two 10-point cards, you can separate your cards into two individual hands. Doubling the bet, you can then play each of your hands with options we discussed. Remember, each ace only gets one point if you’re splitting them. If you get a ten and ace after splitting, then it counts as 21 points, but not a Blackjack. Sometimes, these rules vary by casino. You can also “surrender” if you forfeit half your wager after the first two cards. In that case, you do not get to play out your hand.  After each player is done with their turn, the dealer turns over his hole card. If the dealer’s hand is valued at 16 or less, he will “hit” to draw additional cards until he goes over 16. If the dealer goes over 21 points, he is bust. Players on the table who are not bust at this point will win. If the dealer does not bust, then whoever has the highest value hand between the dealer and the player wins. You’ll receive even money from winning wagers. If you have a Blackjack, at most casinos, you will be paid 3 to 2.  Blackjack Strategy to Improve Your Odds of Winning  Computer simulations and probability calculations have helped develop a basic Blackjack strategy. If this strategy is fully followed, the house advantage can be reduced to 0.5% over the long run.  Per the basic strategy, here’s what you should do when the first two cards are dealt to you, and you can see dealer’s face up card:   If you have 8 or below, hit irrespective of what the dealer has.  If you have 9 and the dealer has 3, 4, 5 or 6, double your bets. If the dealer has 2 or 7, hit.  If you have 10 and the dealer has anything between 2 and 9, you should double down. If the dealer has a 10 or ace, hit.  If you have 11 and the dealer’s card value is between 2 and 10, double down. If the dealer has an ace, hit.  If you have 12 and the dealer has 2, 3, or 7 and higher, hit. Stand if the dealer has 4, 5 or 6.  If you have between 13 and 16, and the dealer has 7 or higher, hit. If the dealer has between 2 and 6, stand.  Always stand if your cards value between 17 and 21.   Baccarat  Baccarat is one of the oldest and most well-known games played in casinos globally. Some of you may remember Baccarat as James Bond’s preferred casino game. It was featured in the Ian Fleming’s 1953 novel debut of Casino Royale, and later in various Bond movies like Dr. No and GoldenEye . Baccarat’s association with James Bond has made the game sexy and attractive to a lot of people. However, do not be fooled by its sexy appeal or James Bond’s high-IQ character. Baccarat is very much a game of chance with no skill or strategy involved.  How to Play Baccarat  As a player, you have the option to wager on three choices: the Banker’s hand, the Player’s hand or the Tie. Think of the Banker and the Player simply as names for the two hands dealt out in each game; these are two outcomes on which you can wager. The “Player” hand has no particular association with the player, and the “Banker” hand is not necessarily associated with the casino or house.  In many ways, Baccarat is similar to Blackjack. In Baccarat, the winning hand has a value closer to 9, whereas in Blackjack you are trying to get close to but not over 21. Just as in Blackjack, in Baccarat, each card has a specific value. The cards 2 to 9 are worth face value. 10s, Jacks, Queens and Kings have a value of 0. An ace is worth 1 point.  Let us say, the Player hand has two cards, “3” and “4.” The value of the hand is the sum of the two cards, i.e. 3 + 4 = 7. Let us take another example, where the two cards are “7” and “8”. The sum of the card values is 7 + 8 = 15. Since 15 is a 2-digit number, you have to drop the left-most digit. The value of this hand in Baccarat is 5.  Once you have placed your bets on one of the options, Player, Banker or Tie, the dealer delivers two cards each for the Player and Banker hands. Depending on the value of the Player hand, a third card may be given to the Player per the rules below. As a Baccarat player, you do not need to know all the rules. The dealers will direct the next steps based on the rules of the game. If you want to know when a third card is drawn for Player or Banker bet, see here .  Baccarat Strategy to Improve Your Odds of Winning  In Baccarat, you cannot influence the cards with strategy. It is a game of chance, and that is why it is very popular among high rollers. You cannot predict the hand, so feel free to go with your instinct, and appreciate the game. The casinos often provide scorecards to track wins each round (Banker, Player or Tie). Based on the patterns you see, and your intuition, you can place your bets to go with or against the trends. Some experts argue that the score-carding strategy is useless, since the outcome of every game is unrelated to the previous games.  One thing that experts agree is to bet on the Banker when in doubt. Betting on the Banker is usually the safest bet considering the house odds and a slight numbers advantage that works in the Banker’s favor.  Craps  Craps will seem complicated to a beginner at first. The table has a ton of different betting options; the pace is fast, and terms used in the game will seem alien. There is good news, though. Craps offers great odds of winning if you stick to a few fundamental plays.  How to Play Craps  Players wager on the outcome of the roll of a pair of dice thrown on the Craps table. One of the players rolls the dice and is called the shooter. Multiple players line up around the table and make their bets on the outcome of the shooter’s dice rolls.  The first roll is called the “come-out.” You can bet on the “come-out” by placing your chips on the “PASS” or “DON’T PASS” bar. A winning “come-out” roll equals a total of 7 or 11. If you betted on the PASS line, and the outcome is 7 or 11, you win. If the shooter gets a 2, 3 or 12, this is “craps,” and the PASS line bettors lose.  If you are betting on the DON’T PASS line, you will win if the shooter throws a 2 or a 3, while 7 or 11 means you lose since the PASS line bettors just won. If the shooter rolls 12, neither the PASS nor the DON’T PASS line bettors win.  So, what are the outcomes remaining? 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10. If the shooter rolls any of these, that number becomes the “point,” and the dealer marks this number on the table with a puck. On the shooter’s next roll, if he or she rolls the “point,” that’s a “pass,” and the PASS line bets win. The DON’T PASS bets lose, and the game is over. If the shooter rolls a 7 before rolling the “point,” DON’T PASS bets win. DON’T PASS bettors are allowed to remove their bets at any time. All wins pay even money.  The “Odds” is a side bet in Craps you can make after a point is thrown. It pays if the “point” is thrown before 7. Depending on the bet, and the rules at a casino, Craps offers 3, 4 and 5 times the odds offered. Four and 10 mean a 3X flat bet. Five and 9 mean a 4X flat bet. A 6 and 8 offers a 5X flat bet.  Craps Strategy to Improve Your Odds of Winning  If Craps rules seem complicated, start one step at a time. The PASS bet is the most fundamental that almost all players make, and it is easy to understand. Start with a PASS or DON’T PASS bet, and with more experience, engage in more bets. The optimal strategy in Craps is to bet on the DON’T PASS line and back it up by laying the odds. This is contrary to how most players bet in Craps, but it gives you the most edge in the long run. If you want to go with the crowd, even with a PASS strategy, you have a great chance of winning.  Roulette  Roulette is another game that is very easy to play in a casino. It is easy to understand, and a lot of people love the slow pace of roulette compared to other games.  How to Play Roulette  In the game of roulette , you are betting on whether a steel ball spinning over a wheel will land on a certain number or a certain color (i.e. red or black, odd or even numbers or a group of numbers).  The American roulette wheel has 38 number slots consisting of numbers 1 through 36 along with numbers 0 and 00. The European roulette wheel has only one 0 slot.  As a player, you can choose to bet on a particular number or several individual numbers. You can also bet if the ball will land on a black- or a red-colored number slot, or an odd or even number. You can also choose number groupings, for example, 1 to 18 and 19 to 36, and so on. There is a place on the table to bet for each of these situations, and you can place multiple bets during each play. The dealer spins the ball in the direction opposite to that of the turning wheel. The play is only valid when the ball completes three revolutions around the spinning wheel. Players can place bets until the dealer announces “no more bets.”  Once the ball comes to a stop on one of the slots, the dealer makes payments to the winners. If you betted on a red number, and the ball landed on a red slot, you win the amount you betted, 1 to 1. If the ball lands on a particular number you betted on, you win 35 to 1. That is a staggering amount and makes roulette an attractive game to play. Some people strategize to keep betting on the same number to win the big payoff. The payout for each situation is described in more details here .  Give Yourself a Fair Shot at Winning  With some learning, you should be on your way to having a great time with table games the next time you visit a casino. Don’t hesitate to learn from a dealer, and feel free to watch others play before you decide to dive in. A big part of your winning will depend on your luck — what cards you get dealt in Blackjack; whether you bet on the Player or the Banker in Baccarat; if you choose to PASS or DON’T PASS in Craps, or if you choose red or black in a Roulette game. Basic strategy and a bit of practice will position you for success. Now that you know what games offer you the best odds, you will ensure you are trying your luck with the right games.

Is it even possible?  Kevin   This is a typical question one might encounter in an introductory statistics class. Because the sum of a large number of random variables always will approach a bell curve we can use the central limit theorem to get at the answer. From my section on the house edge we find the standard deviation in blackjack to be 1.17. You won't understand this if you haven't studied statistics, but the probability of being at a loss in your example will be the Z statistic of 45000*0.005/(45000 1/2 *1.17) =~ 0.91. Any basic statistics book should have a standard normal table which will give the Z statistic of 0.8186. So the probability of being ahead in your example is about 18%.     I have a few questions regarding blackjack: How often can one expect the dealer to bust and how often can a player expect to win four hands in a row?  John from Westminster, USA   When the dealer stands on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.1% of the time. When the dealer hits on a soft 17, the dealer will bust about 29.6% of the time.  According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of a net win is 42.42%.  However, if we skip ties, the probability is 46.36%.  So, the probability of a four wins in a row is 0.4636 4 = 4.62%.     First of all, I would like to add my name to the growing list of people who love your web site. Your information is quite valuable to both the beginning and expert gambler, and you present your findings in a pleasant, understandable, and even humorous manner. I always check out your site before I head to Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe just to remind me how to play smartly. Anyway, on to my question. Well, more of an observation: when the dealer pulls a 5 on a 16 for their sixth consecutive win, there's always someone who gets up and leaves the table, muttering that the dealer is a mean cruel heartless soul, and goes in search of a "hotter" table. But is there any truth in this? Obviously the dealer is inconsequential to the cards dealt (I like to say the dealer is "simply a messenger of the cards") but are streaks in an 8-deck shoe inevitable, and even predictable? Or is it more like your roulette example, where the odds of each new round are exactly the same? Thanks once again for your web site.  Dave K. from Beverly Hills, California   Thanks for your kind words. Streaks, such as the dealer drawing a 5 to a 16, are inevitable but not predictable. Blackjack is not entirely a game of independent trials like roulette, but the deck is not predisposed to run in streaks. For the non-card counter it may be assumed that the odds are the same in each new round. Putting aside some minor effects of deck composition, the dealer who pulled a 5 to a 16 the last five times in a row would be just as likely to do it the next time as the dealer who had been busting on 16 for several hours.     What are the odds against winning seven hands of blackjack in a row? How about six?  James from Palo Alto, California   According to my blackjack appendix 4 , the probability of an overall win in blackjack is 42.22%, a tie is 8.48%, and a loss is 49.10%. I'm going to assume you wish to ignore ties for purposes of the streak.  In that case, the probability of a win, given a resolved bet, is 46.36%.  The probability of winning n hands is a row is 0.4636 n . So the probability of winning six in a row is 0.99% and seven in a row is 0.46%.     Can it actually be true that what I experience has a statistical base? It seems to me that it takes a lot longer to win X number of chips that to lose the same amount (I only play blackjack). For example, if I start with 300 chips, it might take hours to double my money (my goal), yet I can lost that number in what seems like almost no time at all. Can this really be true? Also, do you have a rule of thumb about when to leave the table when you are winning?  Chris from Gaithersburg, Maryland   What you have experienced is likely the result of some very bad losing streaks. It may also be the result of progressive betting or mistakes in strategy. The basic strategy flat bettor should have a roughly symmetrical expectation in terms of steep ups and downs, slightly favoring steep downs due to the house edge and a 48% chance of a losing hand compared to 43% chance of winning.  If I'm playing for fun then I leave the table when I'm not having fun any longer.     In a six-deck shoe, what is the percentage of times that a blackjack (ace face card or ten) will come up?  Ed from Lynnwood, USA   Let n be the number of decks. The probability of a blackjack is 2*(4/13)*(4n/(52*n-1)). If n=6 the probability is 192/4043 = 4.75%.     Still love your site! I always turn to your site when I'm having questions, most of the time I will find the answer but not always. When playing basic strategy blackjack I understand that I will have ups and downs and over the long run I will roughly break even, my question is what is really "over the long run"? A month, a year, five years? Any ideas?  Kim from Helsinki, Finland   Thanks for the kind words. You ask a good question for which there is no firm answer. It is more a matter of degree, the more you play the more your results will approach the house edge. I recently replaced my blackjack appendix 4 with some information about the standard deviation which may help. For example this table shows that if you play 10,000 hands of blackjack the probability is 90% of finishing within 192 units where you started after subtracting the expected loss due to the house edge. So in 10,000 hands you are likely to win or lose less than 2% of total money bet due to random variation. However if we go up to one million hands the probability is 90% of an 0.2% variation due to luck. In general the variation in the mean is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of hands you play. All of this assumes flat betting, otherwise the math really gets messy.     Please explain how to calculate the probability of a blackjack occurring in a single deck. I can easily work other hands but when a card can be either/or my brain cramps.  Mike from Bossier City, USA   The probability that the first card is an ace is 4/52. The probability that the second card is a 10 point card is 16/51. So the probability of an ace first blackjack is (4/52)*(16/51). Multiply this by 2 because the ten could just as easily be the first card and the answer is 2*(4/52)*(16/51) = 128/2652 = 0.0482655, or about 1 in 20.7 .     Do you have any idea what the "record" is for the most sevens thrown with a pair of fair dice in craps is? I had someone tell me it was 84, but the odds against that many sevens in a row being thrown is so long I'm  skeptical. It seems it's more possible that 84 consecutive passes have come out, but even that's a million to one shot (figuratively--literally, it's much worse). I tried to look on the Web but have no idea where I would find something like that.  Mike   Since this question was submitted, a player held the dice for 154 rolls on May 23, 2009 in Atlantic City.  The probability of this is 1 in  5,590,264,072.  For the probability for any number of throws from 1 to 200, please see my craps survival tables .  For how to solve the problem yourself, see my MathProblems.info site, problem 204.     If I play 100 hands of blackjack at $5 a hand at an 0.5% house edge how much can I lose and still be above three standard deviations south of expectation?  Blair from Christchurch, New Zealand   Your expected loss would be 100*$5*.005=$2.50. The standard deviation of one hand is 1.17, which can be found in my blackjack appendix 7 . So, one standard deviation in your example is $5*1.17*sqr(100)=$58.5. So, the probability of losing $295 or more due to bad luck is .00135 (the Z statistic for -3).     If the first card dealt is an ace what is the probability the dealer will have a blackjack? Assume two decks.  T from Las Vegas, U.S.   There are 103 cards remaining in the two decks and 32 are tens. So the probability of a blackjack is 32/103=31.07%.     What percentage of hands are suited blackjacks? Six-deck shoe, any suit.  RWR from Tuscon, USA   The probability of a suited blackjack in a six-deck game is 2*(4/13)*(6/311) = 0.0118723.     For blackjack, which is the probability to obtain three suited seven in a 6-deck shoe?  Rodrigo from Costa Rica   I attempt to work this out in my blackjack appendix 8 but I’ll work through it more slowly here. We’ll ignore dealer blackjacks to keep things simple and assume the player always hits after two cards. The number of ways to arrange 3 cards in a 6-deck shoe is combin(312,3)=5,013,320. There are 24 sevens in the shoe. The number of ways to arrange 3 sevens out of 24 is combin(24,3)=2024. The probability is the number of winning combinations divided by total combinations, or 2024/5013320=0.0004, or about 1 in 2477.     What piece of information am I missing? If the odds of pulling a ten count card out of a deck is about 30.7% and the odds of pulling out an ace is 7.8% then it seems to me that the combined odds of this happening are about 2.4%. Why do blackjack simulators and blackjack authors state that the odds for a blackjack are 4.7% which happens to twice the calculated odds. What am I missing?  Jeffrey from Loveland   You are forgetting that there are two possible orders, either the ace or the ten can be first. Multiply by 2 and you’ll have your answer.     You go, wiz. Our local casino hands out promotional coupons, which act as a first-card ace in blackjack. From your BJ appendix, most hands containing an ace have a positive expectation, without counting the BJs you’ll get four out of every thirteen plays. Do you know the overall expectation of having an ace as your first card? Thanks.  Victor from Yakima, Washington   According to Stanford Wong’s ’Basic Blackjack’ he says the player’s edge given the first card is an ace is 50.5% (page 124). Your question however could be rephrased as, "what is the value of the ace, given that the other card is not a ten." Using an infinite deck for the sake of simplicity we can breakdown Wong’s number as follows: 0.505 = (4/13)*1.5 + (9/13)*x, where x is what you want to know. Doing some simple algebra we get x=28.5%.     I have just read an article that says it’s proper basic strategy to stand on a multiple card 16, containing a 4 or 5, Vs. a dealer’s 10 in a multiple deck (4 or more decks) blackjack game. I checked your web site and I could only find appendixes for multiple card hands in 1 and 2 deck games. Is this article correct?  Rodney from Clarence, New York   Yes! Good question, even I didn’t know this. The fewer the decks and the greater the number of cards the more this is true. To test the most likely case to favor hitting, 8 decks and only 3 cards, I ran every possible situation through my combinatorial program. The following table displays the results.

The dealer hits on soft 17. I wonder what the odds are of standing on 16 when the dealer’s upcard is 7. It seems only a 10 or face card can beat this and the odds would be in my favor if the dealer draws more than one card. Also, since most strategies are based on millions of calculations done on a computer, I wonder if those of us who will never play a million hands can rely on slight variations like this one. Is this a poor, fair or bad move to make?  Richard S. from Memphis, USA   According to my blackjack appendix 9H the expected return of standing is -0.476476 and of hitting is -0.408624, assuming the 16 is composed of a 10 and 6. So my hitting you will save 6.79 cents for each dollar bet. This is not even a marginal play. There is no sound bite answer to explain why you should hit. These expected values consider all the numerous ways the hand can play out. The best play for a billion hands is the best play for one hand. If you want to deviate from the basic strategy here are some borderline plays: 12 against 3, 12 against 4, 13 against 2, 16 against 10. Deviating on these hands will cost you much less.    My friend and I are debating two blackjack issues that arose from his Caribbean Vacation. (1) What shift in odds does the dealer NOT drawing the second card have? House favor or player favor? (2) in your simulations, what impact does the number of players have on the accuracy of the odds?  Beau from Toronto, Canada   (1) It depends what happens if the dealer does have a blackjack. If the player is guaranteed to lose no more than the original wager then it doesn’t matter if the dealer takes a second card or not. If the player stands to lose the total amount bet after doubling or splitting and the dealer gets a blackjack then that works to the dealer’s advantage. (2) I don’t have to simulate this because the number of players makes no difference.    In blackjack, what is the probability of a blackjack?  Anonymous   It depends on the number of decks. If the number of decks is n then the probability is 2*pr(ace)*pr(10) = 2*(1/13)*(16*n/(52*n-1)), which is conveniently about 1 in 21. 

Here is the exact answer for various numbers of decks.   Probability of Blackjack     Decks  Probability    1  4.827%    2  4.780%    3  4.764%    4  4.757%    5  4.752%    6  4.749%    7  4.747%    8  4.745%        What is the probability that you play ten hands and never obtain a (two-card) 21? Assume the cards are reshuffled after each play?  Matt from Radford, USA   If the probability of a blackjack is p then the probability of not getting any blackjacks in 10 hands is 1-(1-p) 10 . For example in a six deck game the answer would be 1- 0.952511 10 = 0.385251.    What are the odds of getting 3 blackjacks in a row with 1 deck 4 players and one dealer.  Joe P from Parma Heights, USA   I’m going to assume there is never a shuffle between hands. The three other players don’t matter. The answer would be 2 3 *(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47)= 0.00004401, or about 1 in 22722. If there were a shuffle between hands the probability would increase substantially.    In two handed blackjack using one deck, what is the probability of the dealer having a blackjack?  Steve from Solva, United Kingdom   The number of hands doesn’t matter. The probability is 2*(4/13)*(8/103) = 0.0478.    What are the odds of a dealer getting 3 blackjacks in a row on a single deck table with two players?  J.A.S. from Las Vegas, USA   It depends whether there is a shuffle between the blackjacks. Assuming there isn’t the probability would be 8*(16/52)*(4/51)*(15/50)*(3/49)*(14/48)*(2/47) = 0.000044011058. The number of other players doesn’t matter, except if they cause a shuffle.    Dear Wizard, I was recently playing blackjack with somewhat of a card-shark who also happens to be my friend. We played casino rules, with one deck- and switched the deal after each time the deck expired. Later, while I was shuffling- I noticed two 9 of spades side by side. My friend obviously claimed he did not know about this, but it seems unlikely. My question is, if you were playing in a similar scenario and were to add one card to the deck, which card would be most advantageous if only you knew about it. Thank you for your time.  Matt   From my blackjack appendix 7 we see that each 9 removed from a single deck game increases the house edge by 0.20%. However if you were going to cheat it would be much better to remove an ace, which increases the house edge by 0.58%. If you were to add a card as the dealer you should add a 5, which increases the house edge by 0.80%. So, the best card for the player is the ace and the best for the dealer is the 5.    I’ve been playing blackjack for quite awhile using basic strategy, mostly betting an even unit each hand. Occasionally I will increase the bet because I "feel" like I am going to win the next one. I would think that just about all recreational players bet on feel once in a while at least. I was reading through some of your past Ask the Wizard columns and saw your calculation of the probability of a string of losses in the August 4, 2002 Column. You know those emotional thoughts that pop in head while gambling (well maybe not your head), "I’m due for a win!" That column seemed to put the mathematics to that "feeling" a player can get. In that columns’ example of a player losing 8 consecutive hands of blackjack the odds were (.5251^8 or about 1 in 173). My question though is what does that really mean? Is it that when I sit down at the table, 1 out of my next 173 playing sessions I can expect to have an 8 hand losing streak? Or does it mean that on any given loss it is a 1 in 173 chance that it was the first of 8 losses coming my way? I know, I know, its some sort of divine intervention betting system I am talking about and no betting system affects the house edge. I’m still curious though. Besides every once in awhile throwing down a bigger bet just adds to the excitement and for some reason it seems logical that if you have lost a string of hands you are "due" for a win.  Steve from Phoenix, AZ   I have no problem with increasing your bet when you get a lucky feeling. What is important is that you play your cards right. Unless you are counting cards you have the free will to bet as much as you want. As I always say all betting systems are equally worthless so flying by the seat of your pants is just as good as flat betting over the long term. When I said the probability of losing 8 hands in a row is 1 in 173 I meant that starting with the next hand the probability of losing 8 in a row is 1 in 173. The chances of 8 losses in a row over a session are greater the longer the session. I hope this answers your question.    Dear wiz, I am a blackjack dealer here in Vegas and the other night dealing, I had 4 out of the 6 ace of spades in my hand. I had A-A-K-A-A-10, so good think is I busted, but quick calculations on the game, we figured getting 4 out of the six aces on one had is around 7mil to 1. Is this number a little high?  Jason   The probability of this occurring in which your other two cards are any two 10-point cards is 4*COMBIN(6,4)*COMBIN(6*16,2)*(4/6)*(3/5)*(1/2)/combin(312,6) 1 in 22,307,231. However there are other ways you get four aces in the same hand, for example the last card might be an 8 or 9. I would have to do a computer simulation to consider all the other combinations. However to make a rough guess I’d say the 7 million looks about right.    After performing my own infinite deck analysis for Blackjack with the same rules as yours (dealer stands all 17s, re-splitting allowed to 4 hands except Aces, which can only be split once, doubling after splitting, draw only one card to split Aces), I came across your site. In comparing expected values, I obtained the same numbers as you in all cases, except for pair splitting, which were slightly different. So I’m wondering how you went about your calculation of expected values for splitting?  Anonymous   It took me years to get the splitting pairs correct myself. Cindy of Gambling Tools was very helpful. Peter Griffin also addresses this topic in chapter 11 of the The Theory of Blackjack Let’s say I want to determine the expected value of splitting eights against a dealer 2. Resplitting up to four hands is allowed. Here is how I did it.   Take a 2 and two 8’s out of the shoe. Determine the probability that the player will not get a third eight on either hand. Go through all ranks, except 8, subtract that card from the deck, play out a hand with that card and an 8, determine the expected value, and multiply by 2. For each rank determine the probability of that rank, given that the probability of another 8 is zero. Take the dot product of the probability and expected value over each rank. Multiply this dot product by the probability from step 2. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 3 hands. Take another 8 out of the deck. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 3 instead of 2. Multiply dot product from step 7 by probability in step 5. Determine the probability that the player will resplit to 4 hands. Take two more 8’s out of the shoe. Repeat step 3 but multiply by 4 instead of 2, and this time consider getting an 8 as a third card, corresponding to the situation where the player is forced to stop resplitting. Multiply dot product from step 11 by probability in step 9. Add values from steps 4, 8, and 12. The hardest part of all this is step 3. I have a very ugly subroutine full of long formulas I determine using probability trees. It gets especially ugly when the dealer has a 10 or ace up.    Dear wiz, How do you calculate the probability of getting three sevens, three colored sevens, and three suited sevens in blackjack?  Geoff   Let’s assume six decks of cards and the player always takes a third card (whether by hitting or splitting). The number of ways to draw 3 suited sevens is the number of suits (4) times the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 sevens of that suit in the shoe. In other words 4× combin (6,3)=4×20=80. The number of ways to draw 3 colored sevens, including 3 suited sevens, is the number of colors times the number of ways to pick 3 out of the 12 sevens in the shoe of that color, or 2×combin(12,3)=2×220=440. The number of ways to draw any 3 sevens, including 3 colored and suited sevens, is the number of ways to pick 3 cards out of the 24 sevens in the shoe, or combin(24,3)=2024. The total number of combinations for any 3 cards out of 312 is combin(312,3)=5013320. So the probability of 3 suited sevens is 80/5013320=0.000015957. The probability of three colored, but not suited, sevens is (440-80)/5013320=0.0000718. The probability of three sevens of mixed colors is (2024-440)/5013320= 0.00031596.    Good job and well done. The question: I notice from your May 5, 2003 Column that you actually CALCULATE your blackjack odds. I am a bit surprised that you were not using your computer to SIMULATE the results. Or is this a stupid question, i.e., the computer will take a million years to do the job?  Anonymous   Yes, I calculate blackjack odds using a combinatorial approach, analyzing every possible ways the player and dealer cards can come out, taking the greatest expected value at every decision point. This is harder to program than a simulation but I feel is more elegant and a nice challenge in recursive programming. However I still respect my peers to do simulations. With today’s computers it doesn’t take long to run off a billion bets, which gets very close to the optimal strategy return.    I recently went to Vegas and had an incredible hand of blackjack... received an ace as first card, split, received another ace, split, received a third ace, split, and got one last ace... Then was dealt blackjack on all 4 hands! No lie! 2 of my friends were witnesses, as was the entire Luxor gaming gods...What are the odds on this? It was a 6 card deck shoe, I was sitting in #3 seat of a 4 person game. Assume a fresh shuffle?  Anonymous   Not too many places allow resplitting aces, so be glad you were playing somewhere that did. Your seat position does not matter. The probability of this is the probability that the first four cards out of the shoe are aces, and the next four are tens, or (combin(24,4)/combin(312,4))*(combin(96,4)/combin(308,4)) = 1 in 4,034,213.    I just witnessed a friend get four blackjacks in a row starting with the first hand of a newly shuffled single deck playing head to head against the dealer. I looked at the FAQ’s and saw the odds for getting one blackjack in single deck, but don’t know how to calculate them for getting four in a row off the top. Instead of a decimal probability, could you tell me the odds of this? It must be astronomical. Hope to hear from you.  Anonymous   I seem to get a variation of this question at least once a month. Let’s assume for now the deck is shuffled after every hand, to make the math easier. If the probability of something happening is p then the probability of it happening n times in a row is p n . The probability of a blackjack in a single deck game is 4*16/combin(52,2) = 64/1326. So the probability of four in a row is (64/1326) 4 = 16777216/ 3091534492176 = 1 in 184270. However the actual probability is much less, because as the player gets each blackjack the ratio of aces to cards left in the deck decreases. Without knowing what cards the dealer got I can’t tell you the exact answer.    First I wanted to tell you how much I look at and love your web site, and admire your math skills. I use 6 decks to deal blackjack, and added 3 jokers for reasons I won’t waste your time with but, what are the odds of dealing all 3 jokers to a player right in a row. Thank you very much.  Anonymous   You’re welcome, thanks for you compliments. The probability of being dealt 3 jokers in a row from a six deck shoe (plus the 3 jokers) is 1/combin(315,3) = 1 in 5,159,805. Another solution is (3/315)*(2/314)*(1/313).    Michael, a person asked you if they are not counting cards in blackjack, what difference does it make how many decks are being used. You stated the difference had mostly to do with the number of stiff hands possible, due to the fact that if a small card came out it was more likely a large card would follow and vice-a-versa. How could that be? Would it still not be a random event with the possibility of a small or large card coming out being equal, if you are not counting?  Anonymous   Every legitimate blackjack expert agrees the house edge decreases as the number of decks goes down, all other rules being equal. However it is hard to explain why. First, it is true that you are more likely to get one small card and one big card in single-deck than multiple-deck. For example if we define a small card as 2 through 6, and a large card as any 10-point card or ace then the probability of getting one of each in single deck is 2*(20/52)*(20/51) = 30.17%. The probability in 8-decks is 2*(160/416)*(160/415) = 29.66%. Although stiffs can cut both ways the player has the free will to stand, the dealer must always hit them.    At a single deck game what is the probability all three players and the dealer get a blackjack the first round after a shuffle?  Anonymous   Following are the probabilities: Player 1 0.048265 Player 2 0.036735 Player 3 0.024823 Dealer 0.012560 The product is 1 in 1,808,986.    Mr. Wizard, Great site. There is a lot of useful and interesting info. I’d like to see more of the mathematics and possible sources of simulations (source code, books, etc.) behind the games. Where would you suggest that a person interested in writing something similar to your "blackjack house edge calculator" go for more info? Thank you for your response.  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. I’m afraid I know of no source, including myself, that shows code for game analysis. It took me years to get my blackjack engine to work perfectly (splits when the dealer had a 10 or ace showing was very tricky). An easier way to get the house edge for blackjack is to write a random simulation. One of these days I would like to write a book on how I analyzed the games, but I’m afraid only you would buy it.    What is the probability of a blackjack for n decks?  Anonymous   2*(4/13)*(4n/(52n-1))    I am a blackjack dealer and last night I amazed my table on a single-deck blackjack game (the horrible 6 to 5). My hand consisted of an Ace up, Ace in the hole and then I drew the other 2 Aces and then a 7 for 21! What are the odds of this happening and I am especially interested in knowing the math. Thanks!  Anonymous   The probability is (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49)*(4/48) = 1 in 3,248,700.    In blackjack, what is the probability of the dealer making a stopping hand (17-21) drawing eight cards? This happened to a friend of mine online and I think it's an extremely rare occurrence. How about seven cards? Thanks for the great site and keep up the awesome work!  Anonymous   Thanks for the compliment. Assuming a six-deck game, where the dealer stands on soft 17, and the player plays basic strategy here are the rounded results based on a 100-million hand simulation.

Also, does increasing the amount available for total wagering increase the likelihood of winning the $200.  Anonymous   If you had a game with no house edge the probability of winning $200 with $5000 to risk, using any system, would be 5000/(5000+200) = 96.15%. The general formula for winning w with a bankroll of b is b/(b+w). So the larger the bankroll the better your chances. The house edge will lower the probability of success by an amount that is hard to quantify. For a low house edge game like blackjack, the reduction in the probability of success will be small. It would take a random simulation to know for sure. Forgive me if I don't bother with that. VegasClick did a small simulation about the probability of success with the Martingale .    As I read your analysis of the Royal Match side bet in blackjack , am I correct that your odds are for the first hand of the shoe? If so, wouldn’t the real-world odds of an easy match be tilted a bit more toward the player? It seems to me that if the suits get unbalanced in any direction it would slightly lessen the house edge, and the suits will certainly fluctuate through the shoe.  Frank from Michigan   This is not true.  The remaining deck needs to be exhibit more than a certain degree of skewness for the odds to swing to the player's favor.  Consider a hypothetical side that pays 3 to 1 for any suited pair in a one-deck game.  Of the top of the deck the probability of winning is 4* combin (13,2)/combin(52,2) = 23.53%.  However if you burn two cards of different suits the probability of winning goes down to 2*(combin(13,2)+combin(12,2))/combin(50,2) = 23.51%.  If you burn two cards of the same suit the probability of winning increases to (3*combin(13,2)+combin(11,2))/combin(52,2) = 23.59%. If one card of each rank were removed the probability of winning would go down to 4*combin(12,2)/combin(48,2) = 23.40%.  What all this shows is that if cards are removed at a uniform distribution the odds of winning go down, however at a very skewed distribution the odds go up. As the deck is played down sometimes your odds get better, and sometimes worse, but in the long run they average out and stay at a 23.53% chance of winning.    I have been a dealer for 27 years and have seen a lot.  One of my favorites was a guy who never looked at his cards playing blackjack....just tucked them.  I thought he was nuts of course but some days he won and some days he lost.  Just like most people.  I tried this myself on a free gambling website and won 2 out of 3 times gambling 20 minute sessions.  My question is this:  How much worse off are you doing this than trying to play basic strategy?  I really don’t think it matters much at all what you do in blackjack for the ’average’ player.  Mark from Las Vegas   Under typical Vegas rules (6-deck, dealer hits soft 17) the house edge by always standing is 15.7%.  In the short-run one could still overcome that, but in the long run you’ll lose badly.    I lost a lot of money playing Cryptologic Blackjack today.  While I don’t think anything is fixed, one aspect of my play seemed well outside the range of probability.  Within 35 hands, the dealer showed a 6 seven times and won each time.  This was verified through the logs.  If the probability of a dealer bust is 56% with a six, my calculation suggests the odds of this independent event happening six consecutive times is 0.23%.  Adam from Toronto   At Cryptologic they use 8 decks and the dealer stands on a soft 17.  According to my blackjack appendix 2 , the probability of the dealer busting with a 6 up is 0.422922.  So the probability of not busing is 1 - 0.422922 = 0.577078.  The probability of not busing 7 times out of 7 is (0.577078) 7 = 2.13%.    First off, my apologies if you consider this a basic math question.  I’m a dealer at a Northern Ontario casino, and last night (for the dealer) drew a 12-card 17 (A-A-A-A-A-A-6-A-A-A-A-A).  We use six decks.  Neither my player or I had ever seen this before.  What are the odds of this?  Timothy Rowland from Orilila   Wow!  The probability of this is (combin(24,6)/combin(312,6)) * (24/306) * (combin(18,5)/combin(305,5)) = 1 in 287,209,346,813,617.    I am a pit supervisor at a local casino and recently had a dealer deal two players two seven of clubs each and give himeself the last seven of clubs as his upcard on a five-deck shoe.  What are the odds of five of the same card coming out of a five-deck shoe in order?  Jesse from Scottsdale   That probability would be 52/ combin (260,5) = 5/9525431552 = 1 in 1,905,086,310.    According to standard BJ rules and perfect basic strategy, how many percent of my DOUBLED DOWN hands should I expect to win, push and lose?  Cameron from Melbourne, Australia   Assuming liberal Vegas Strip rules (six decks, dealer stands on soft 17, double after split allowed, late surrender allowed, resplitting aces allowed) the following are the probabilities of each possible outcome when doubling on the initial two cards.  This does not include doubling after splitting.   Win: 54.99% Lose: 38.06% Draw: 6.95%  I’ve played a lot of Blackjack over the years but have never struck anything like the situation I experienced on the weekend.  Playing $25 a hand I lost 19 hands in a row with no pushes.  One of the hands was a double down, so effectively I lost 20 x $25 bets in a row. I was playing strict Basic Strategy for New Zealand conditions (not counting, CSM in use).  Have you ever heard of such a horror streak?  I was ahead about $300 when the sky fell in but stuck to the strategy and eventually left the session $200 ahead and very relieved.  My calculations estimate the probability of 19 straight losses as 1 chance in about 207,000; you may well correct me on this.  I play to a betting progression system, purely for discipline/money management purposes which has me betting 1 unit after every loss.  Had I done anything differently, I would have been cleaned out well before the 19 hands came up.  Ken from Auckland, New Zealand   From my blackjack appendix 4 we see the following probabilities for each initial hand.    Win 42.43% Lose 49.09% Draw 8.48%  So the probability of going exactly 19 losses in a row is 0.4909^19*(1-0.4909) = 1 in 1,459,921.  By way of comparison, the probability of being dealt a royal flush in video poker is 1 in 649,740, or 2.25 times as likely.  Avid video poker players have been known to receive several dealt royals, so if you play a lot of blackjack you’ll likely hit such a losing streak eventually.    I’m totally baffled!  If in an 8-deck or continuous shuffle blackjack game there is no difference in the probabilities of a card appearing at any time, why have you posted Blackjack Appendix #18 ?  If the probabilities say hit on 16 vs. 7 or higher, how can the probabilities change if you have 5 or 6 cards as opposed to 2 cards?  16 is 16 no matter how you construct it, right?  I see the change if the deck is shrinking or in a game like Spanish 21 where there is a bonus for 21 with 5 or more cards, but why in an 8-deck game or continuous shuffle?  Ernie from Toledo   The reason the strategy changes, according to the number of cards in your hand, as shown in appendix 18, is that every card that leaves the deck changes the probabilities of every card left to be played.  A good example is the single-deck basic strategy says to surrender 7,7 against a 10; but for any other 14 you should hit.  The reason you should surrender is half the sevens have already been removed from the deck.  You need another seven to make 21, the only hand that will beat a dealer 20.  So the shortage of sevens lowers the expected value of hitting to under half a bet, making surrender the better play. In an eight-deck shoe there are 416 cards.  That may seem like a lot, but 16 against a 10 is such a borderline hand that removal of just one card can making standing a better play.  The rule is that for eight or fewer decks if your 16 is composed of three or more cards, and the dealer has a 10, then you should stand. In a two-card 16 the average points per card is 8, with a 3-card 16 the average is 5.33.  With more small cards out of the deck in the 3-card hand the remaining deck becomes more large card rich, making hitting more dangerous, swaying the odds in favor of standing.    Hi Wizard.  Thanks for maintaining this web site! I have a question about a blackjack rule that is applied in Dutch casinos: When being dealt a pair of sevens, a third seven will earn you 2:1 on your bet, regardless if you win the hand or not. However, this only applies when the sevens have NOT been split. I know that there are 6 dealer up cards in basic strategy that allow splitting sevens and 7 that do not, so the player should have an edge in this particular situation. But what are the odds of being dealt 3 sevens in blackjack in the first place? And if dealt 3 sevens, what are the odds they qualify for the 2:1 pay-out rule, based on a 4 to 6 decks, dealer stands on soft 17 basic strategy chart? Hope you can figure this one out for me. Keep up the good work!  Stan from The Netherlands, Europe   I show that rule is worth 0.026% to the player.  Despite the incentive to hit 7,7 against a dealer 2-7, the player should still follow basic strategy and split.    I have a friend who starts complaining when his first card is a six, without waiting to see what his second card and the dealer’s up card are.  I think he should wait because he could get a two, three, four, five, etc. (i.e., a decent second card) OR the dealer could show a two through six (a good card for the table).  What do you think?  How much worse are his odds of winning with a first card of six without knowing this second card or the dealer’s up card? Or is my friend just a whiner?  Thank you for your time.  Scott from Long Beach   My blackjack appendix 14 shows that if your first card is a six your expected value is already about −21%.  For example, if he bet $100, a fair price to sell the hand and bet would be about $79. Maybe you can take advantage of his complaining by offering to buy his hand for less than the fair 79 cents on the dollar.  I’d suggest 75 cents on the dollar, to give you an edge, without taking too much advantage.    Bally Gaming has a single-deck, multi-hand, blackjack game.  The player plays seven hands against a single dealer hand.  There is an interesting rule in that if the game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  What is the probability of running out of cards?  Can have suggest any strategy changes to run out the deck?  Michael L. from West Mifflin, PA   For the benefit of other readers, the full set of rules is:   Single deck. Dealer stands on soft 17. Winning blackjack pays even money. Player may double any first two cards. No double after split. Player may resplit to four hands, including aces. No draw to split aces. No surrender. Six-card Charlie (player unbusted six cards automatically wins). Cards shuffled after every hand. If game runs out of cards, all unbusted player hands automatically win.  The house edge using total-dependent basic strategy is 2.13%.  I ran a 7-player simulation, using total-dependent basic strategy, and the average number of cards used per round was 21.65, with a standard deviation of 2.72.  In almost 190 million rounds played, the most cards ever used was 42, which happened 7 times. It is my educated opinion that even with computer perfect composition-dependent strategy the player would still realistically never see the last card.  You could cut down the house edge much more using composition-dependent strategy, according to all the cards seen as you go along.  However bucking 2.13% house edge to start with, you’ll never get anywhere near break-even, regardless of how hard you try.    Recently, the Tuscany casino ran a promotion where if you got 30 blackjacks in a 30-day period, you would win a $100 bonus. At first, the minimum bet was $5 to get your card stamped. However, I later heard the minimum for a stamp was raised to $15. I wrote a letter of complaint about it to the casino manager, stating in part:   I just wanted to express my disappointment in this change, if it is true. I never had a chance to take advantage of the promotion and doubt I will be able to now. The amount of time necessary to receive 30 blackjacks (I’m told about 8 hours of continuous play) seems unreasonable at $15/hand when the promotion still offers only $100.  Here is the reply I received:  In response to your e-mail on the blackjack blackout promotion, I’m not sure where you received your information on how long it takes to complete the blackout card. We’ve seen players complete the card in less than four hours. Also, you have thirty days in which to complete the card. I hope you understand this is not a task that is unreachable with that much time. I THANK YOU for your letter. It’s good to hear feedback from our customers. Hope you can give it a try and win some money! What is the probability of getting 30 blackjacks in four hours?  nyuhoosier   According to my game comparison , blackjack players play about 70 hands per hour.  The probability of a blackjack in a six-deck game is 24*96/combin(312,2)=4.75%.  I assume a blackjack tie still gets a stamp.  So it should take about 30/0.0475=632 hands to fill the card, or 9.02 hours. The probability of filling the card in 4 hours, assuming 280 hands, is 1 in 30,000 playing one hand at a time.  I suspect any player achieving the goal in four hours was playing at least two hands at a time. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas .    On a recent Vegas trip I saw the dealer get a 9-card 21.  The rules were six decks and the dealer stood on soft 17.  What are the odds of that?  aceofspades   The probability of the dealer getting exactly a 9-card 21 under those rules is 1 in 32,178,035.

CLOSE                                     10 Tips to Beat the Odds at the Casino     BY the mag , BY Jeff Wilser  February 18, 2016                         Bill Zender is the ultimate gambling insider. The former professional card counter, dealer, and casino floor manager shares his secrets—and explains why the best paying machine is always the ATM.  1. Identify the clumsiest dealers.  Zender estimates there are fewer than 100 professional blackjack card counters in the world. If you happen to be one of them, you might nab a 1.5 percent advantage. So save your energy, Zender advises; instead keep an eye out for the sloppy blackjack dealer who will accidentally flash the face-down card. Zender once made a living exploiting this, keeping a notebook of 35 weak dealers from 16 different casinos. The strategy is called “card holing,” and it can give you a 6 to 9 percent edge over the house. (That’s like standing in front of an ATM that spits out twenties!) The best part? “It’s totally legal,” Zender says. “They may throw me out of the casino, but they’re not going to arrest me.”  2. Keep your eyes on the prize.  Lately, casinos have sexed up their table games with bikini-clad dealers and resident pole dancers. These places are called Party Pits, and on the surface, they look like Vegas being Vegas—booze, sin, skin. But look closer. While all those twirling legs keep you distracted, you’ll probably fail to notice that the casino trimmed the payouts at these tables from 3/2 to 6/5. Meaning that a $100 bet wins only $120, compared to the traditional $150. This essentially doubles the house’s edge.  3. Know when to say when.  The house always enjoys a 5 percent edge at roulette. You have a decent chance of winning that first spin. And the second. And the third. But if you were to play roulette forever, the house would take away all your chips. Every casino has calculated the point at which they are guaranteed victory, and that magic number is 30,000 hands. (This is why they lure us back with lobster and luxury suites.) So if you’re winning, stop.  4. Exploit the laws of nature.  The roulette wheel is a mechanical instrument. Over time, the wheel may become unbalanced or the frets separating the numbers may suffer wear and tear. The more a wheel is used, the more worn down it gets—and the more it may privilege certain numbers. In 1873, Joseph Jagger found a wonky wheel at Monte Carlo and bet on the biased numbers. He came away with $400,000—that’s $7.8 million in today’s dough!  5. Go big or go broke.  “The average slot machine is probably two, three times more costly to players than the table games,” says Zender. Avoid them. If you insist on cranking a handle, focus on slots that cost $5 or more and play the max bet. On penny slots, the odds are jacked up in the house’s favor by 15 to 20 percent. You might as well toss those coins in a fountain. Don’t forget to make a wish.  6. Don’t play Keno.  Really, just don’t. Your chances are terrible. At some casinos, the house has a 35 percent edge. No gambler has ever matched all 20 numbers on a 20-spot ticket. The odds of it ever happening are 1 in 3,535,316,142,212,174,336. (That’s 3.5 quintillion!)  7. Practice makes perfect.  If there’s an exception to the adage that the house always wins, it’s in video poker. Typically, the house has only a 0.46 percent advantage (while some versions lean in the gambler’s favor). The pay table is posted right on the machine, and the payoff is high. The catch? To cash out, you need to play at an expert level. Casinos make profits on video poker because most players simply aren’t skilled enough. So study up.  8. Stay away from the light.  “Ninety percent of the people who walk into a casino have no idea of the odds stacked against them,” Zender says. But if you know what you’re looking for, it’s easy to see where the odds are the worst. Casinos make the games with the lousiest odds the most attractive by amping them up with flashing lights and bright colors. At craps, for instance, the craziest bets—“the Field,” “Any 7”—are the most colorful. So as a general rule, to better your odds, stick to the drab side of the room.  9. Invest in a nice watch.  There’s a reason you probably won’t see any clocks or windows on the house floor. Casinos want you to lose track of time so you play for as long as possible. Some casinos prohibit dealers from wearing watches for that reason. Once you’re up a bit, it might be a good time to leave the floor and go treat yourself to a new timepiece.  10. Buy your own drinks.  The truth is, nothing is free—and that includes the free booze. Each casino has something they call a “player reinvestment” fund. It predicts the amount of money you’ll lose and then returns a cut of that in the form of comps, which, to the casual floor visitor, means watery well cocktails. The worse your odds, the better your chances of landing a free drink. Cheers!

"You're too fat to be an astronaut," he once told a boy sharing his dream of space travel.  British media who delighted in quoting him are still lamenting the 96-year-old's recent retirement from public duties. But the people of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu are likely to be optimistic he'll now have the time to join them: They worship him as a god and have based a religion on him.  Followers of the Prince Philip Movement, which started in the 1960s, believe that the prince was born to fulfill an ancient prophecy: that the son of an ancient mountain spirit would one day take the form of a pale-skinned man, travel abroad, marry a powerful lady, and eventually return to the island. When villagers saw the prince’s portrait, they felt the spirit in it, and when he visited Vanuatu in 1974, they were convinced.  Chief Jack Naiva, a respected warrior in the culture, greeted the royal yacht and caught sight of Philip on board. "I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform," Naiva once said. "I knew then that he was the true messiah."  True believers assign large world movements to the machinations of Philip. They once claimed his powers had enabled a black man to become president of the United States and that his "magic" had assisted in helping locate Osama bin Laden. The community has corresponded with Buckingham Palace and even sent Philip a nal-nal , a traditional club for killing pigs, as a token of its appreciation. In return, he sent a portrait in which he’s holding the gift.             TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images      The picture is now part of a shrine set up in Yaohnanen in Vanuatu that includes other photos and a Union flag. In May 2017, shortly after the Prince announced his retirement, a cyclone threatened the island—and its shrine. But according to Matthew Baylis , an author who has lived with the tribe, the natives didn't see this so much as a cause for concern as they did a harbinger of the prince's arrival so he can bask in their worship. To date, Prince Philip has not announced any plans to relocate. A version of this story ran in a 2012 issue of Mental Floss magazine.  celebrities  Europe  History  News  politics  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                          John Ueland      arrow   History     How a Single Mom Created a Plastic Food-Storage Empire     BY Jen  Doll  June 6, 2017          John Ueland              On an unseasonably warm day in April 1954, hundreds of women in cowboy hats gathered outside Tupperware’s Florida headquarters to dig for buried treasure. There, in a nearby swampy area dubbed the “Forest of Spades,” 600 shovels stood at the ready. The excitement was palpable. At the appointed signal, the women raced for the roped-off soil, grabbed shovels, and began to hunt frantically for loot.  It was the pinnacle of the inaugural Tupperware Jubilee, a five-day, gold-rush-themed affair celebrating all things Tupperware. No expense was spared: To give the event a Western feel, frontier-style buildings with false fronts had been erected and bulls and horses were trucked in. The women, and a smattering of men, had traveled from all across the country to participate. A collection of Tupperware dealers, distributors, and sales managers, they made the pilgrimage for the motivational speeches, sales instruction, and especially for the bizarre bonding rituals.  For five hours that day, they prospected for mink stoles and freezer units, gold watches and diamond rings. One of them, Fay Maccalupo of Buffalo, New York, dug up a toy car. When she saw the real Ford it represented, she planted her face against the hood and began to weep, repeating, “I love everybody.” Four women fainted and had to be revived with smelling salts. It was understandable, considering that the total cash value of all the prizes buried in the Florida dirt was $75,000.  Presiding over the treasure hunt was the general sales manager of the Tupperware Home Parties division, a 40-year-old woman named Brownie Wise. For hours, she cheered on the ladies from a loudspeaker with an air of royalty. As she watched them hop on shovels and unearth the rewards of their labors, she couldn’t help but feel proud. Wise took satisfaction in seeing her hard work pay off—once again. The jubilee, which she had organized, had all the pizzazz and spirit expected of an official Tupperware event. The media agreed: Network news was there to cover it, and Life magazine ran a photo essay highlighting the excitement and glamour.  Clearly, there’s more to Tupperware than leftovers. The story of the ubiquitous plastic container is a story of innovation and reinvention: how a new kind of plastic, made from an industrial waste material, ended up a symbol of female empowerment. The product ushered women into the workforce, encouraging them to make their own money, better their families, and win accolades and prizes without fear of being branded that 1950s anathema, “the career woman.”  Digging in the dirt for a gold watch may not mesh with today’s concept of a successful working woman, but at the time, the near-religious fervor seen at the jubilees and other Tupperware gatherings demonstrated just how ground-breaking the company’s sales plan was—the product became a multimillion dollar success not by exploiting women, but by embracing and boosting them. All of this was because of Brownie Wise. The story of Tupperware is her story.  Brownie Wise, named for her big, brown eyes, was born in rural Georgia. Her parents divorced when she was young, and as a teen she traveled with her mother, who organized union rallies. While touring the Deep South, Brownie started giving speeches at her mother’s rallies and soon proved to be a gifted and motivating orator. She “awed people,” writes Bob Kealing in his biography Tupperware Unsealed. “[They] were surprised that someone so young could deliver a speech like a pastor.”  Wise was married briefly, but by 27, she was a divorced single mom in suburban Detroit. During World War II, she worked as a secretary at Bendix Aviation, a company that made parts for navy torpedo planes. It was a decent but unfulfilling job. On the side, Wise penned an advice column for the Detroit News, writing under the alter ego “Hibiscus.” A housewife who led an idyllic life with her child and husband in a home called “Lovehaven,” Hibiscus had everything Wise did not. But what Wise did possess was an endless fountain of determination. As she wrote in a journal at that time, “I wanted to be a successful human being.”  It all started with a bad door-to-door salesman. When a Stanley Home Products salesman knocked on her door and proceeded to deliver a terrible sales pitch for cleaning supplies, Wise scoffed that she could do better. At the time, Stanley was experimenting with a peculiar sales model: home parties. A New Hampshire mop salesman had watched his numbers fly through the roof after he invited a bunch of women over for a party that included a mop demonstration. The company encouraged other salesmen to try the strategy, but many of them delegated the party-hosting to their wives. Thinking it’d be a fun job on the side, Wise started selling Stanley products at parties too. Before long, she was making enough money to quit her job at Bendix.  Wise was blessed with the gift of gab, and her special blend of folksy real talk and motherly encouragement helped her rise through Stanley’s ranks. Soon she was in management and hoping to ascend even higher. But those illusions were quashed at a meeting with Stanley head Frank Beveridge, who told Wise she’d never become an executive. Its halls were “no place for a woman,” he said. Wise returned home furious. The rejection lit a fire in her—she vowed that someday, somehow, she would prove Beveridge wrong.  She didn’t know that the key to fulfilling this dream would be in plastic food-storage containers. Wise first glimpsed Tupperware at a sales meeting. One of her coworkers had seen the products gathering dust in a department store and decided to bring them in. At first, Wise didn’t think they were anything special. But when she accidentally knocked a Tupperware bowl off the table, she realized its full potential: Instead of breaking, it bounced.  It seemed like magic. Tupperware was unlike any home product she’d seen before. It was attractive, coming in pastel colors and flexible shapes, almost like art. More importantly, it was functional—no other competing product even came close. Convinced of its potential, Wise traded in her Stanley brooms in 1949 and started throwing parties to sell Tupperware. What she didn’t intend, exactly, was to kindle a revolution.        AP  The most amazing thing about Tupperware wasn’t that it extended the life of leftovers and a family’s budget, although it did both remarkably well. It was, above all, a career maker. When women came to one of Wise’s parties, they were more than just convinced to buy the product— Wise was such a charming host that she persuaded many buyers to also become Tupperware salespeople. The more parties Wise hosted, the more tricks she learned to convert women into Tupperware faithful. Putting people on waiting lists, for instance, made them more eager to buy, so she signed them up regardless of whether the product was available. She also discovered that throwing containers full of liquid across the room made customers reach straight for their checkbooks. Amassing more and more saleswomen, Wise encouraged her followers to do the same. By October 1949, she had 19 recruits, enough to move her supplies out of her house and into a larger warehouse. Driven by the idea of making money simply by throwing parties for friends and neighbors, the women in Wise’s workforce ballooned in number. Soon, other Tupperware parties were taking place across the country. Wise’s team in Detroit was selling more Tupperware than most department stores. This soon attracted the attention of the no-nonsense founder of the Tupperware Corporation, Earl Silas Tupper. Tupperware, true to its name, was Tupper’s masterpiece, and he was counting on it to make his dreams come true. Having grown up in a poor Massachusetts farm family, he had vowed to make a million dollars by the time he was 30. He hadn’t. He did have a host of esoteric inventions—among them, a fish-powered boat and no-drip ice cream cone—under his belt. But with a wife and family to support, he’d concentrated on a practical career in plastics, first at DuPont and then at a company of his own, which made parts for Jeeps and gas masks during World War II. When the war ended, Tupper decided to buy cheap surpluses left over from wartime manufacturing. He figured he’d be able to do something with them. That’s how he ended up with a glob of greasy black polyethylene, a smelly waste product left behind when metal is created from ore. Tupper took it and, after months of trial and error, wrangled the slag into submission, creating a light-weight plastic that refused to break. Tupper dubbed it “Poly-T,” and, taking inspiration from the way paint cans sealed, created a flexible container with a noiseless lid that snapped on. He called the box Tupperware. He patented the seal in 1949 and rolled out 14 products he called the “Millionaire Line.” The only problem? He couldn’t get anyone to buy it. At least not until Wise came along. Her sales record was remarkable—in 1949, she’d rung up $150,000 in orders and was offered a promotion: distribution rights to the entire state of Florida. In the spring of 1950, she moved south with her son, Jerry, and her mother. She found a store space, and by May she’d opened her business and was scouting for new salespeople. Still, not everything was going smoothly. Along with disputes over turf with other distributors, she was constantly contending with botched orders, shipping delays, and product shortages. In March of 1951, Wise had had enough. She called Tupper in a fury. It was the first time they’d spoken, but she was too livid for niceties; she ripped into him immediately. This was hurting not just her bottom line, but also his. Did he not understand how crucial it was that the problems be fixed immediately? Tupper assured her that he’d fix any issues and then asked a favor: He wanted to hear her sales secrets. The next month, the two met at a conference on Long Island and Wise explained her selling technique. It was pointless, she explained, to think that people would see Tupperware on store shelves or in catalogs and want to buy it. Instead, people had to touch it, squeeze it, drop it, seal it. They had to experience Tupperware from a trusted friend or neighbor. She gave a bold prescription for saving Tupper’s business: Ditch department stores altogether and focus entirely on throwing home parties. Tupper took the advice to heart. So much, in fact, that the day after their meeting, he created a new division just for home parties and asked Wise to be the general manager. Wise had reached her goal: She had become an executive. It was a perfect fit, too. She had a stellar track record—she was selling more Tupperware than anyone anywhere—and Tupper was bowled over by her charm. “You talk a lot and everybody listens,” he said. “She was the yin to Tupper’s yang,” Kealing writes. “Where he was fussy and reclusive, Wise lived to mingle with and inspire the dealer workforce.” They were a match made in sales heaven. Or so it seemed.       AP  In 1952, the first full year of Wise’s watch, Tupperware sales rocketed. Wholesale orders exceeded $2 million. During the last half of the year, sales tripled. Tupperware parties did exactly what Wise promised they would, and she became the company’s shining star. That year, Tupper gave her a salary of $20,933.33, more than she had ever made. For her birthday in 1953, he presented her with a gold-dyed palomino horse. Even more remarkably, he gave her the freedom to do practically whatever she wanted. So Wise traveled the country recruiting, presiding over sales conferences, and announcing contests and doling out prizes for incentive—including, sometimes, her own clothes. By the looks of it, most of Wise’s Tupperware recruits fit neatly into the stereotypical role of a proper housewife. But, in reality, they surreptitiously represented a new kind of female empowerment. During World War II, many women had no choice but to enter the workforce. At its end, many of them had no choice but to leave it. Suddenly, selling Tupperware at parties allowed women to straddle both worlds. They were employed, yet they didn’t appear to challenge their husbands' authority or the status quo. This pioneering entrepreneurial model allowed them to inhabit a workforce outside of the one the hustling salesman inhabited, and, in many cases, to do even better than he did. And that power relied specifically on a network of female friends and neighbors. The parties weren’t just a way for women to keep occupied—it was a way they could contribute to their family’s bottom line. Most women who worked outside the home had low-paying jobs in fields like light manufacturing, retail, clerical work, and health and education. The money—committed dealers could bring in $100 or more per week—was a revelation. The opportunity for success was so great that the husbands of some Tupperware ladies left their own jobs to work with their wives. Wise was something of an early Oprah, giving away fantastic prizes, operating in a grass-roots, word-of-mouth fashion and showing rather than telling other women how to succeed in the comfort of their own homes. The fact that she made many women understand the benefits of becoming salespeople, building the brand further, simply made her a fantastic executive. Wise embraced the spirit of female entrepreneurship wholeheartedly. In her prime, she wrote a morale-boosting newsletter called Tupperware Sparks , published a primer called Tupperware Know-How , and had a 52-minute film, A Tupperware Home Party , made as a training tool. She even convinced Tupper to move the company headquarters to Florida. When Tupper bought property in Kissimmee, Wise turned it into a Mecca-like pilgrimage site for Tupperware devotees. Part of the power of Wise’s sales technique, which at times seemed more faith than business, was that it gave the impression that the sky was the limit, and it relied on collective power. This wasn’t just the traditional salesperson’s dog-eat-dog world: Instead, the group was a “family” that helped one another climb to the top. Women who had previously only had their names in print upon birth or marriage were being recognized for their success, with their names, photographs, and accomplishments appearing in Wise’s newsletters. Along with making their own money, they received rewards—top distributors got cars—and the chance to collaborate with other women in a friendly but competitive environment. Wise increased the fervor with her annual jubilees, which had their own rituals, like candlelit graduation ceremonies and group sing-alongs featuring choruses of “I’ve got that Tupper feeling deep in my heart.” “No woman got praised for scrubbing floors,” Elsie Mortland, who became Tupperware’s Home Kitchen Demonstrator, told Kealing in an interview in 2005. “But when they got praised for selling Tupperware, they had something to be proud of.” Wise was the head of the household, and the Tupperware ladies all wanted to be a part of her extended family. Success was limited only by how hard a person was willing to work, a belief that Wise preached passionately. Unfortunately, she had been duped into thinking her boss shared that opinion.       Alamy  As Wise became the face of Tupperware, sales and press continued to skyrocket. In 1954, she was the first woman to appear on the cover of Business Week. But as glowing as the magazine’s profile was, it contained warning signs about the future of her partnership with Tupper. The piece credited Wise and her sales technique with Tupperware’s estimated $25 million in retail sales and seemed to downplay Tupper’s role as president of the company he had created. Tupper had never craved the spotlight; in fact, he was known to use the back door of his office to avoid attracting attention. But he was keen to ensure that his product, not an employee, received the lion’s share of any attention. And somewhere along the way, Wise had started to upstage the plastic containers she helped make famous. After the Business Week article, Tupper wrote a note to Wise that contained a glimmer of the storm that was to come: “However, good executive as you are, I still like best the pictures ... with TUPPERWARE!” The good press continued but, in 1955, after several powerful distributors left the company, sales began to lag. Hard times strained Wise and Tupper’s relationship. By 1956, angry letters were flying back and forth between them, and at one point, Tupper stopped taking Wise’s calls. Her complaints and frank criticisms, previously helpful, had become jabs he couldn’t endure. He also started to believe that she was costing him money, irked that she had her own side business selling self-help books at company events. More to the point, he started to suspect that if he tried selling the company—which he was planning to do—having a female executive would get in the way. Finally, in 1958, Tupper flew to Florida and fired Wise. After a heated legal battle, she received only $30,000 as a settlement. She didn’t own her house and was ordered to vacate. She had no stocks in the company; she didn’t even own many of the clothes she wore. The man she’d helped make a millionaire didn’t seem to care: Tupper ordered her name expunged from the company history and buried the 600 remaining copies of her book in an unmarked pit behind Tupperware’s Florida headquarters. Later that year, he sold the company to Rexall Drug for $16 million, divorced his wife, and bought an island in Central America. He died in Costa Rica in 1983. Wise, on the other hand, tried starting new companies but never achieved the same success she had with Tupperware. She led a quiet life with her horses, pottery, and her son until she died at her home in Kissimmee in 1992. Her influence, however, has not waned. Today, according to the PBS American Experience documentary Tupperware! , the product is sold in about 100 countries, while “every 2.5 seconds, a Tupperware party is held somewhere in the world.” In this respect, the Golden Age of Tupperware hasn’t ended so much as it has solidified. When was the last time you stored food in a plastic container with a sealing mechanism? Tupperware is so much a part of our food culture that we don’t even think about its continuing influence, and yet we still rely on it daily. This story is one of reinvention too: a useless plastic reimagined into something needed, of food being stored in wholly new ways, of women emerging from their kitchens to showcase their worth and proclaim their identities, of sales techniques evolving to embrace the customer, and of the singular character of Brownie Wise, who changed what it meant to be a woman in the workforce. Because of that, as Houston Post writer Napoleon Hill wrote in 1956, “It has been estimated that Brownie Wise has helped more women to financial success than any other single living person.” Early in Wise’s tenure at the company, Tupper presented her with a piece of the raw polyethylene he’d used to make Tupperware. She saw it as poetic proof of his vision: He had created something beautiful from this unappealing glob of plastic, using nothing but imagination and persistence. It was “the best sales story I have ever heard in all my life,” she wrote. She considered “Poly,” as Tupper called it, a prized possession and would have her women touch it for good luck, telling them, “Just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want. Know it’s going to come true, and then get out and work like everything ... and it will!”  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                                SECTIONS     arrow   LIVE SMARTER          LIVE SMARTER   LIVE SMARTER  BIG QUESTIONS  WEATHER WATCH  JOB SECRETS  QUIZZES  WORLD WAR 1  SMART SHOPPING  STONES, BONES, & WRECKS  #TBT  THE PRESIDENTS  WORDS  RETROBITUARIES         arrow   LIVE SMARTER      This Is The Right Way to Load Your Dishwasher         USPS's 'Informed Delivery' Service Will Email You Pictures of the Mail You're Getting Today           13 Amazon Echo Hacks to Get the Most Out of Alexa           MORE LIVE SMARTER                             More from mental floss studios                                MENTAL FLOSS   ABOUT  RSS  CONTACT US  SHOP   ©2018 Mental Floss, Inc.

CLOSE                                     10 Tips to Beat the Odds at the Casino     BY the mag , BY Jeff Wilser  February 18, 2016                         Bill Zender is the ultimate gambling insider. The former professional card counter, dealer, and casino floor manager shares his secrets—and explains why the best paying machine is always the ATM.  1. Identify the clumsiest dealers.  Zender estimates there are fewer than 100 professional blackjack card counters in the world. If you happen to be one of them, you might nab a 1.5 percent advantage. So save your energy, Zender advises; instead keep an eye out for the sloppy blackjack dealer who will accidentally flash the face-down card. Zender once made a living exploiting this, keeping a notebook of 35 weak dealers from 16 different casinos. The strategy is called “card holing,” and it can give you a 6 to 9 percent edge over the house. (That’s like standing in front of an ATM that spits out twenties!) The best part? “It’s totally legal,” Zender says. “They may throw me out of the casino, but they’re not going to arrest me.”  2. Keep your eyes on the prize.  Lately, casinos have sexed up their table games with bikini-clad dealers and resident pole dancers. These places are called Party Pits, and on the surface, they look like Vegas being Vegas—booze, sin, skin. But look closer. While all those twirling legs keep you distracted, you’ll probably fail to notice that the casino trimmed the payouts at these tables from 3/2 to 6/5. Meaning that a $100 bet wins only $120, compared to the traditional $150. This essentially doubles the house’s edge.  3. Know when to say when.  The house always enjoys a 5 percent edge at roulette. You have a decent chance of winning that first spin. And the second. And the third. But if you were to play roulette forever, the house would take away all your chips. Every casino has calculated the point at which they are guaranteed victory, and that magic number is 30,000 hands. (This is why they lure us back with lobster and luxury suites.) So if you’re winning, stop.  4. Exploit the laws of nature.  The roulette wheel is a mechanical instrument. Over time, the wheel may become unbalanced or the frets separating the numbers may suffer wear and tear. The more a wheel is used, the more worn down it gets—and the more it may privilege certain numbers. In 1873, Joseph Jagger found a wonky wheel at Monte Carlo and bet on the biased numbers. He came away with $400,000—that’s $7.8 million in today’s dough!  5. Go big or go broke.  “The average slot machine is probably two, three times more costly to players than the table games,” says Zender. Avoid them. If you insist on cranking a handle, focus on slots that cost $5 or more and play the max bet. On penny slots, the odds are jacked up in the house’s favor by 15 to 20 percent. You might as well toss those coins in a fountain. Don’t forget to make a wish.  6. Don’t play Keno.  Really, just don’t. Your chances are terrible. At some casinos, the house has a 35 percent edge. No gambler has ever matched all 20 numbers on a 20-spot ticket. The odds of it ever happening are 1 in 3,535,316,142,212,174,336. (That’s 3.5 quintillion!)  7. Practice makes perfect.  If there’s an exception to the adage that the house always wins, it’s in video poker. Typically, the house has only a 0.46 percent advantage (while some versions lean in the gambler’s favor). The pay table is posted right on the machine, and the payoff is high. The catch? To cash out, you need to play at an expert level. Casinos make profits on video poker because most players simply aren’t skilled enough. So study up.  8. Stay away from the light.  “Ninety percent of the people who walk into a casino have no idea of the odds stacked against them,” Zender says. But if you know what you’re looking for, it’s easy to see where the odds are the worst. Casinos make the games with the lousiest odds the most attractive by amping them up with flashing lights and bright colors. At craps, for instance, the craziest bets—“the Field,” “Any 7”—are the most colorful. So as a general rule, to better your odds, stick to the drab side of the room.  9. Invest in a nice watch.  There’s a reason you probably won’t see any clocks or windows on the house floor. Casinos want you to lose track of time so you play for as long as possible. Some casinos prohibit dealers from wearing watches for that reason. Once you’re up a bit, it might be a good time to leave the floor and go treat yourself to a new timepiece.  10. Buy your own drinks.  The truth is, nothing is free—and that includes the free booze. Each casino has something they call a “player reinvestment” fund. It predicts the amount of money you’ll lose and then returns a cut of that in the form of comps, which, to the casual floor visitor, means watery well cocktails. The worse your odds, the better your chances of landing a free drink. Cheers!

"You're too fat to be an astronaut," he once told a boy sharing his dream of space travel.  British media who delighted in quoting him are still lamenting the 96-year-old's recent retirement from public duties. But the people of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu are likely to be optimistic he'll now have the time to join them: They worship him as a god and have based a religion on him.  Followers of the Prince Philip Movement, which started in the 1960s, believe that the prince was born to fulfill an ancient prophecy: that the son of an ancient mountain spirit would one day take the form of a pale-skinned man, travel abroad, marry a powerful lady, and eventually return to the island. When villagers saw the prince’s portrait, they felt the spirit in it, and when he visited Vanuatu in 1974, they were convinced.  Chief Jack Naiva, a respected warrior in the culture, greeted the royal yacht and caught sight of Philip on board. "I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform," Naiva once said. "I knew then that he was the true messiah."  True believers assign large world movements to the machinations of Philip. They once claimed his powers had enabled a black man to become president of the United States and that his "magic" had assisted in helping locate Osama bin Laden. The community has corresponded with Buckingham Palace and even sent Philip a nal-nal , a traditional club for killing pigs, as a token of its appreciation. In return, he sent a portrait in which he’s holding the gift.             TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images      The picture is now part of a shrine set up in Yaohnanen in Vanuatu that includes other photos and a Union flag. In May 2017, shortly after the Prince announced his retirement, a cyclone threatened the island—and its shrine. But according to Matthew Baylis , an author who has lived with the tribe, the natives didn't see this so much as a cause for concern as they did a harbinger of the prince's arrival so he can bask in their worship. To date, Prince Philip has not announced any plans to relocate. A version of this story ran in a 2012 issue of Mental Floss magazine.  celebrities  Europe  History  News  politics  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                          John Ueland      arrow   History     How a Single Mom Created a Plastic Food-Storage Empire     BY Jen  Doll  June 6, 2017          John Ueland              On an unseasonably warm day in April 1954, hundreds of women in cowboy hats gathered outside Tupperware’s Florida headquarters to dig for buried treasure. There, in a nearby swampy area dubbed the “Forest of Spades,” 600 shovels stood at the ready. The excitement was palpable. At the appointed signal, the women raced for the roped-off soil, grabbed shovels, and began to hunt frantically for loot.  It was the pinnacle of the inaugural Tupperware Jubilee, a five-day, gold-rush-themed affair celebrating all things Tupperware. No expense was spared: To give the event a Western feel, frontier-style buildings with false fronts had been erected and bulls and horses were trucked in. The women, and a smattering of men, had traveled from all across the country to participate. A collection of Tupperware dealers, distributors, and sales managers, they made the pilgrimage for the motivational speeches, sales instruction, and especially for the bizarre bonding rituals.  For five hours that day, they prospected for mink stoles and freezer units, gold watches and diamond rings. One of them, Fay Maccalupo of Buffalo, New York, dug up a toy car. When she saw the real Ford it represented, she planted her face against the hood and began to weep, repeating, “I love everybody.” Four women fainted and had to be revived with smelling salts. It was understandable, considering that the total cash value of all the prizes buried in the Florida dirt was $75,000.  Presiding over the treasure hunt was the general sales manager of the Tupperware Home Parties division, a 40-year-old woman named Brownie Wise. For hours, she cheered on the ladies from a loudspeaker with an air of royalty. As she watched them hop on shovels and unearth the rewards of their labors, she couldn’t help but feel proud. Wise took satisfaction in seeing her hard work pay off—once again. The jubilee, which she had organized, had all the pizzazz and spirit expected of an official Tupperware event. The media agreed: Network news was there to cover it, and Life magazine ran a photo essay highlighting the excitement and glamour.  Clearly, there’s more to Tupperware than leftovers. The story of the ubiquitous plastic container is a story of innovation and reinvention: how a new kind of plastic, made from an industrial waste material, ended up a symbol of female empowerment. The product ushered women into the workforce, encouraging them to make their own money, better their families, and win accolades and prizes without fear of being branded that 1950s anathema, “the career woman.”  Digging in the dirt for a gold watch may not mesh with today’s concept of a successful working woman, but at the time, the near-religious fervor seen at the jubilees and other Tupperware gatherings demonstrated just how ground-breaking the company’s sales plan was—the product became a multimillion dollar success not by exploiting women, but by embracing and boosting them. All of this was because of Brownie Wise. The story of Tupperware is her story.  Brownie Wise, named for her big, brown eyes, was born in rural Georgia. Her parents divorced when she was young, and as a teen she traveled with her mother, who organized union rallies. While touring the Deep South, Brownie started giving speeches at her mother’s rallies and soon proved to be a gifted and motivating orator. She “awed people,” writes Bob Kealing in his biography Tupperware Unsealed. “[They] were surprised that someone so young could deliver a speech like a pastor.”  Wise was married briefly, but by 27, she was a divorced single mom in suburban Detroit. During World War II, she worked as a secretary at Bendix Aviation, a company that made parts for navy torpedo planes. It was a decent but unfulfilling job. On the side, Wise penned an advice column for the Detroit News, writing under the alter ego “Hibiscus.” A housewife who led an idyllic life with her child and husband in a home called “Lovehaven,” Hibiscus had everything Wise did not. But what Wise did possess was an endless fountain of determination. As she wrote in a journal at that time, “I wanted to be a successful human being.”  It all started with a bad door-to-door salesman. When a Stanley Home Products salesman knocked on her door and proceeded to deliver a terrible sales pitch for cleaning supplies, Wise scoffed that she could do better. At the time, Stanley was experimenting with a peculiar sales model: home parties. A New Hampshire mop salesman had watched his numbers fly through the roof after he invited a bunch of women over for a party that included a mop demonstration. The company encouraged other salesmen to try the strategy, but many of them delegated the party-hosting to their wives. Thinking it’d be a fun job on the side, Wise started selling Stanley products at parties too. Before long, she was making enough money to quit her job at Bendix.  Wise was blessed with the gift of gab, and her special blend of folksy real talk and motherly encouragement helped her rise through Stanley’s ranks. Soon she was in management and hoping to ascend even higher. But those illusions were quashed at a meeting with Stanley head Frank Beveridge, who told Wise she’d never become an executive. Its halls were “no place for a woman,” he said. Wise returned home furious. The rejection lit a fire in her—she vowed that someday, somehow, she would prove Beveridge wrong.  She didn’t know that the key to fulfilling this dream would be in plastic food-storage containers. Wise first glimpsed Tupperware at a sales meeting. One of her coworkers had seen the products gathering dust in a department store and decided to bring them in. At first, Wise didn’t think they were anything special. But when she accidentally knocked a Tupperware bowl off the table, she realized its full potential: Instead of breaking, it bounced.  It seemed like magic. Tupperware was unlike any home product she’d seen before. It was attractive, coming in pastel colors and flexible shapes, almost like art. More importantly, it was functional—no other competing product even came close. Convinced of its potential, Wise traded in her Stanley brooms in 1949 and started throwing parties to sell Tupperware. What she didn’t intend, exactly, was to kindle a revolution.        AP  The most amazing thing about Tupperware wasn’t that it extended the life of leftovers and a family’s budget, although it did both remarkably well. It was, above all, a career maker. When women came to one of Wise’s parties, they were more than just convinced to buy the product— Wise was such a charming host that she persuaded many buyers to also become Tupperware salespeople. The more parties Wise hosted, the more tricks she learned to convert women into Tupperware faithful. Putting people on waiting lists, for instance, made them more eager to buy, so she signed them up regardless of whether the product was available. She also discovered that throwing containers full of liquid across the room made customers reach straight for their checkbooks. Amassing more and more saleswomen, Wise encouraged her followers to do the same. By October 1949, she had 19 recruits, enough to move her supplies out of her house and into a larger warehouse. Driven by the idea of making money simply by throwing parties for friends and neighbors, the women in Wise’s workforce ballooned in number. Soon, other Tupperware parties were taking place across the country. Wise’s team in Detroit was selling more Tupperware than most department stores. This soon attracted the attention of the no-nonsense founder of the Tupperware Corporation, Earl Silas Tupper. Tupperware, true to its name, was Tupper’s masterpiece, and he was counting on it to make his dreams come true. Having grown up in a poor Massachusetts farm family, he had vowed to make a million dollars by the time he was 30. He hadn’t. He did have a host of esoteric inventions—among them, a fish-powered boat and no-drip ice cream cone—under his belt. But with a wife and family to support, he’d concentrated on a practical career in plastics, first at DuPont and then at a company of his own, which made parts for Jeeps and gas masks during World War II. When the war ended, Tupper decided to buy cheap surpluses left over from wartime manufacturing. He figured he’d be able to do something with them. That’s how he ended up with a glob of greasy black polyethylene, a smelly waste product left behind when metal is created from ore. Tupper took it and, after months of trial and error, wrangled the slag into submission, creating a light-weight plastic that refused to break. Tupper dubbed it “Poly-T,” and, taking inspiration from the way paint cans sealed, created a flexible container with a noiseless lid that snapped on. He called the box Tupperware. He patented the seal in 1949 and rolled out 14 products he called the “Millionaire Line.” The only problem? He couldn’t get anyone to buy it. At least not until Wise came along. Her sales record was remarkable—in 1949, she’d rung up $150,000 in orders and was offered a promotion: distribution rights to the entire state of Florida. In the spring of 1950, she moved south with her son, Jerry, and her mother. She found a store space, and by May she’d opened her business and was scouting for new salespeople. Still, not everything was going smoothly. Along with disputes over turf with other distributors, she was constantly contending with botched orders, shipping delays, and product shortages. In March of 1951, Wise had had enough. She called Tupper in a fury. It was the first time they’d spoken, but she was too livid for niceties; she ripped into him immediately. This was hurting not just her bottom line, but also his. Did he not understand how crucial it was that the problems be fixed immediately? Tupper assured her that he’d fix any issues and then asked a favor: He wanted to hear her sales secrets. The next month, the two met at a conference on Long Island and Wise explained her selling technique. It was pointless, she explained, to think that people would see Tupperware on store shelves or in catalogs and want to buy it. Instead, people had to touch it, squeeze it, drop it, seal it. They had to experience Tupperware from a trusted friend or neighbor. She gave a bold prescription for saving Tupper’s business: Ditch department stores altogether and focus entirely on throwing home parties. Tupper took the advice to heart. So much, in fact, that the day after their meeting, he created a new division just for home parties and asked Wise to be the general manager. Wise had reached her goal: She had become an executive. It was a perfect fit, too. She had a stellar track record—she was selling more Tupperware than anyone anywhere—and Tupper was bowled over by her charm. “You talk a lot and everybody listens,” he said. “She was the yin to Tupper’s yang,” Kealing writes. “Where he was fussy and reclusive, Wise lived to mingle with and inspire the dealer workforce.” They were a match made in sales heaven. Or so it seemed.       AP  In 1952, the first full year of Wise’s watch, Tupperware sales rocketed. Wholesale orders exceeded $2 million. During the last half of the year, sales tripled. Tupperware parties did exactly what Wise promised they would, and she became the company’s shining star. That year, Tupper gave her a salary of $20,933.33, more than she had ever made. For her birthday in 1953, he presented her with a gold-dyed palomino horse. Even more remarkably, he gave her the freedom to do practically whatever she wanted. So Wise traveled the country recruiting, presiding over sales conferences, and announcing contests and doling out prizes for incentive—including, sometimes, her own clothes. By the looks of it, most of Wise’s Tupperware recruits fit neatly into the stereotypical role of a proper housewife. But, in reality, they surreptitiously represented a new kind of female empowerment. During World War II, many women had no choice but to enter the workforce. At its end, many of them had no choice but to leave it. Suddenly, selling Tupperware at parties allowed women to straddle both worlds. They were employed, yet they didn’t appear to challenge their husbands' authority or the status quo. This pioneering entrepreneurial model allowed them to inhabit a workforce outside of the one the hustling salesman inhabited, and, in many cases, to do even better than he did. And that power relied specifically on a network of female friends and neighbors. The parties weren’t just a way for women to keep occupied—it was a way they could contribute to their family’s bottom line. Most women who worked outside the home had low-paying jobs in fields like light manufacturing, retail, clerical work, and health and education. The money—committed dealers could bring in $100 or more per week—was a revelation. The opportunity for success was so great that the husbands of some Tupperware ladies left their own jobs to work with their wives. Wise was something of an early Oprah, giving away fantastic prizes, operating in a grass-roots, word-of-mouth fashion and showing rather than telling other women how to succeed in the comfort of their own homes. The fact that she made many women understand the benefits of becoming salespeople, building the brand further, simply made her a fantastic executive. Wise embraced the spirit of female entrepreneurship wholeheartedly. In her prime, she wrote a morale-boosting newsletter called Tupperware Sparks , published a primer called Tupperware Know-How , and had a 52-minute film, A Tupperware Home Party , made as a training tool. She even convinced Tupper to move the company headquarters to Florida. When Tupper bought property in Kissimmee, Wise turned it into a Mecca-like pilgrimage site for Tupperware devotees. Part of the power of Wise’s sales technique, which at times seemed more faith than business, was that it gave the impression that the sky was the limit, and it relied on collective power. This wasn’t just the traditional salesperson’s dog-eat-dog world: Instead, the group was a “family” that helped one another climb to the top. Women who had previously only had their names in print upon birth or marriage were being recognized for their success, with their names, photographs, and accomplishments appearing in Wise’s newsletters. Along with making their own money, they received rewards—top distributors got cars—and the chance to collaborate with other women in a friendly but competitive environment. Wise increased the fervor with her annual jubilees, which had their own rituals, like candlelit graduation ceremonies and group sing-alongs featuring choruses of “I’ve got that Tupper feeling deep in my heart.” “No woman got praised for scrubbing floors,” Elsie Mortland, who became Tupperware’s Home Kitchen Demonstrator, told Kealing in an interview in 2005. “But when they got praised for selling Tupperware, they had something to be proud of.” Wise was the head of the household, and the Tupperware ladies all wanted to be a part of her extended family. Success was limited only by how hard a person was willing to work, a belief that Wise preached passionately. Unfortunately, she had been duped into thinking her boss shared that opinion.       Alamy  As Wise became the face of Tupperware, sales and press continued to skyrocket. In 1954, she was the first woman to appear on the cover of Business Week. But as glowing as the magazine’s profile was, it contained warning signs about the future of her partnership with Tupper. The piece credited Wise and her sales technique with Tupperware’s estimated $25 million in retail sales and seemed to downplay Tupper’s role as president of the company he had created. Tupper had never craved the spotlight; in fact, he was known to use the back door of his office to avoid attracting attention. But he was keen to ensure that his product, not an employee, received the lion’s share of any attention. And somewhere along the way, Wise had started to upstage the plastic containers she helped make famous. After the Business Week article, Tupper wrote a note to Wise that contained a glimmer of the storm that was to come: “However, good executive as you are, I still like best the pictures ... with TUPPERWARE!” The good press continued but, in 1955, after several powerful distributors left the company, sales began to lag. Hard times strained Wise and Tupper’s relationship. By 1956, angry letters were flying back and forth between them, and at one point, Tupper stopped taking Wise’s calls. Her complaints and frank criticisms, previously helpful, had become jabs he couldn’t endure. He also started to believe that she was costing him money, irked that she had her own side business selling self-help books at company events. More to the point, he started to suspect that if he tried selling the company—which he was planning to do—having a female executive would get in the way. Finally, in 1958, Tupper flew to Florida and fired Wise. After a heated legal battle, she received only $30,000 as a settlement. She didn’t own her house and was ordered to vacate. She had no stocks in the company; she didn’t even own many of the clothes she wore. The man she’d helped make a millionaire didn’t seem to care: Tupper ordered her name expunged from the company history and buried the 600 remaining copies of her book in an unmarked pit behind Tupperware’s Florida headquarters. Later that year, he sold the company to Rexall Drug for $16 million, divorced his wife, and bought an island in Central America. He died in Costa Rica in 1983. Wise, on the other hand, tried starting new companies but never achieved the same success she had with Tupperware. She led a quiet life with her horses, pottery, and her son until she died at her home in Kissimmee in 1992. Her influence, however, has not waned. Today, according to the PBS American Experience documentary Tupperware! , the product is sold in about 100 countries, while “every 2.5 seconds, a Tupperware party is held somewhere in the world.” In this respect, the Golden Age of Tupperware hasn’t ended so much as it has solidified. When was the last time you stored food in a plastic container with a sealing mechanism? Tupperware is so much a part of our food culture that we don’t even think about its continuing influence, and yet we still rely on it daily. This story is one of reinvention too: a useless plastic reimagined into something needed, of food being stored in wholly new ways, of women emerging from their kitchens to showcase their worth and proclaim their identities, of sales techniques evolving to embrace the customer, and of the singular character of Brownie Wise, who changed what it meant to be a woman in the workforce. Because of that, as Houston Post writer Napoleon Hill wrote in 1956, “It has been estimated that Brownie Wise has helped more women to financial success than any other single living person.” Early in Wise’s tenure at the company, Tupper presented her with a piece of the raw polyethylene he’d used to make Tupperware. She saw it as poetic proof of his vision: He had created something beautiful from this unappealing glob of plastic, using nothing but imagination and persistence. It was “the best sales story I have ever heard in all my life,” she wrote. She considered “Poly,” as Tupper called it, a prized possession and would have her women touch it for good luck, telling them, “Just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want. Know it’s going to come true, and then get out and work like everything ... and it will!”  the magazine      FACEBOOK  0       TWITTER       EMAIL                                                SECTIONS     arrow   LIVE SMARTER          LIVE SMARTER   LIVE SMARTER  BIG QUESTIONS  WEATHER WATCH  JOB SECRETS  QUIZZES  WORLD WAR 1  SMART SHOPPING  STONES, BONES, & WRECKS  #TBT  THE PRESIDENTS  WORDS  RETROBITUARIES         arrow   LIVE SMARTER      This Is The Right Way to Load Your Dishwasher         USPS's 'Informed Delivery' Service Will Email You Pictures of the Mail You're Getting Today           13 Amazon Echo Hacks to Get the Most Out of Alexa           MORE LIVE SMARTER                             More from mental floss studios                                MENTAL FLOSS   ABOUT  RSS  CONTACT US  SHOP   ©2018 Mental Floss, Inc.

Show Caption  Hide Caption            Previous     Next                                 Many people will be visiting a casino this summer, whether on a trip to Vegas, on a cruise ship, or just at a local casino during a "staycation." But before you go, you may want to know which games give you the best chance of winning.  So we went behind the scene at two casinos, and spoke with the game managers, to find out which games give you an edge.   Table Games Your Best Bet  Jay Bean, a Caesar's floor manager, agreed to sit down with us and talk about the games with the best odds.  He said many people don't realize that table games have much better odds than slots. They are intimidated by thoughts of card sharks taking their money, with images of an intense Texas Hold 'Em tournament in their minds, and so they stick with the safe games: the slots. But they are doing themselves a disservice, he said.  Bean's advice? After you've spent some time on the slot machines, move on to the Blackjack table, and start by just observing.   1. Blackjack  Blackjack has the best odds of winning, with a house edge of just 1 percent in most casinos, Bean said. Plus, you are playing against only the dealer, not hooded poker champions.  "Blackjack is one of our easiest games to play," Bean said. "You're just looking for a number that beats the dealer's number without going over 21."  If you're a novice, Bean said to sit down during a less busy time, such as the afternoon, and the dealer will walk you through the game. But the same is not true with poker: You should practice the game with your friends first, at home, Bean said, until you are comfortable with it. Bean said novices are best off passing on the poker tables, where yes, the competition can be tough. You can find out more information about the game of blackjack at the following link:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/ 2. Craps  So from the Blackjack table, he suggests moving on to the dice game Craps, the game with the second best odds, also nearly 50-50.  The Craps table can be a bit intimidating for the beginner with all the boxes on the table, Bean admitted. But it's really not tough, and it has one of your best chances of winning. In the end, all you are really doing is betting on a dice roll. For more information on craps, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/ 3. Roulette  Bean said your next stop should be the Roulette wheel. It's simple, and pays fairly well.  "So you bet on your favorite numbers," Bean said. "The dealer spins, and if your number comes in you win."  If you stick to betting on just Reds or Blacks, you have nearly a 50-50 chance of walking away a winner. If it lands on red when you choose red, you will double your bet, Bean explained.  While it may seem you have an even chance of winning by simply choosing a color, there is one catch that gives the house its edge: the extra green 0 and 00 position on the wheel. It's on all American roulette wheels.  Or, if you feel lucky, play just one number. It's hard to win, but if you do it pays out 36 to 1.  For more information on roulette, visit:  http://wizardofodds.com/games/roulette/ Worst Odds  Your worst odds? The casinos, understandably, did not want to talk about games with poor odds.  So we turned to Forbes Magazine, which in a report about Best Bets at the Casino , said two popular games -- the Wheel of Fortune and the ever-popular slot machines -- have the lowest odds of winning, with a house edge of 10 percent or more.   The Experts Agree  Professor of Analytics Michael Magazine has crunched the numbers, and agreed that blackjack is the best way to go home with money in your pockets. He said if you take a little time to learn the game, you have the best odds of winning.  "You are somewhere between 44 percent to 48 percent in every single hand of winning," he said, noting that no other casino game gives you odds that good.  But Magazine cautioned that he's not promoting gambling, because he said even games with the best odds still favor the house.  "Play it long enough and you will lose. In the long term the house doesn't lose," Magazine said. If You Love The Slots....  Finally, if you really enjoy playing the slots, here is some good information to know, from state casino reports we examined. With slots, the more money you put in per bet, the higher your chance of winning. If you put the max in a penny machine, which is usually around 50 cents, you have much better odds than if you put in 2 cents. In addition, penny slots have the lowest odds, with $1 and $5 slots paying much better.  Always gamble responsibly, and don't waste your money. __________________________ You can learn more about specific odds of slots machines in each state that has casino gambling by visiting the American Casino Guide.

Probabilities vs. Chances in Casino Gambling Published on July 9, 2017 ★ Luis A. Solferino Follow Following Unfollow ★ Luis A. Solferino Sign in to follow this author Casino Executive Random chance plays an important role of every type of gambling game. Skill is the leverage (in terms of knowledge of the rules of the game) you apply to maximize your potential for winning and minimize your potential for losing. No casino gambling game is ever determined by skill alone.We cannot measure random chance and gamblers frequently mistake their knowledge of games’ probability tables for predictive knowledge. Probabilities do not predict anything. If you know the probabilities for the outcome of the next round in a casino game, you can feel more confident about your next action. That is all the probabilities guarantee you.  The casino, on the other hand, uses the probabilities to determine the maximum risk it accepts per round in a game. The casino represents those acceptable risks in terms of the odds they give per wager. The mathematical probability of an event happening is 1 divided by the number of possible events. You add the probabilities for identical events together to compute unique probabilities. But because random chance is used to determine game outcomes, the probabilities have no effect on what happens next. And the odds do not reflect the probabilities.  Why are Chance and Probability not Always the Same  To master probability theory you only need to remember two things:   Probabilities are computed from known data.  Probabilities never predict the future.   Chance is that immeasurable unknown potential for the outcome you desire. We don’t know what the potential for any outcome truly is. We assume that each outcome has a probability that somewhat correlates with the potential. Games can “defy the odds” by performing way outside our expectations. Most gambling experts seem to use blackjack to explain probabilities; these explanations are where we begin to blur the lines between “probability” and “chance”.  Here’s a simple example:  There are four aces in a deck of 52 cards. That means you have a 1-in-13 chance of being dealt an ace from a freshly shuffled deck. That “chance” is based on the probability distribution of the aces.  Why is it okay to use “chance” and “probability” like this?  Except for which card comes next, there are no unknown factors in blackjack games. Only one random factor affects the outcome of deals in blackjack: the shuffling of the cards. If the dealer could choose which card came next, that would add a second random factor to the game.  When only one random factor influences the outcome of a game, the chances for given outcomes occurring tend to converge to their probabilities. We don’t know why that is so. It just seems to be so.  Why Odds are Different from Probabilities  You will often hear people say, “What are the odds of that happening?” Ironically, odds are even less reliable at predicting things than probabilities. If you invert the probabilities for a given type of gambling game, you need to adjust the resulting numbers slightly downwards to determine the odds.  Odds have to be less than inverted probabilities to ensure that casinos make a profit. By paying back less to the players (cumulatively) than the players wager on games, the casinos can make enough profits to stay in business. But whereas the probabilities don’t predict game outcomes the odds limit the amount of risk casinos accept by covering player wagers. From the casino’s point of view the odds are a little more reliable than the probabilities. From a player’s point of view the probabilities are a little more reliable than the odds.  How Odds Become Almost Inverse to the Probabilities  When you don’t know the outcome of the games you play and you need to make a profit the only thing you can do is hedge your bets. You do this by paying prizes as if there were fewer possible outcomes for each game. Of course, casinos step aside from the odds and probabilities altogether in poker rooms and just charge a player’s fee.  Roulette offers a great example of how casinos use the odds in a game to favor themselves. In roulette the odds on a single number bet are 35 to 1, but the probability of winning a single number bet is 1 divided by the number of slots on the wheel (36 to 38). Hence the odds are never the inverse of the probabilities. This way the casino maintains a “house edge” that ensures the casino retains some percentage of player wagers. A game can be designed around any maximum payout. If you want to award a maximum prize of 10,000 to 1 odds then all you need to do is design a game that has more than 10,000 possible outcomes.  Slot Machines Games are More Chaotic than Probabilistic  There are three types of slot games:   The old fashioned mechanical reel games  Class II slot games  Virtual slot games that simulate old fashioned mechanical reel games.   Class II slot games use networked bingo games to determine the outcome of each spin. The reels are adjusted to form a pattern that closely matches the value of the bingo game pattern. Otherwise the maximum number of possible outcomes for a slot game is the product of number of reels and the number of slots per reel.  Mechanical reel slots typically have fewer possible outcomes than virtual slot games. A virtual slot game has several advantages over the mechanical games: the virtual game can use more stops per reel and more reels. The virtual slot games can also change their reels, and some do during bonus games.  Here is how a slot game can pay a 10,000 to 1 prize:  The game uses 3 reels with 22 slots each. This combination produces 10,648 possible outcomes (combinations). The jackpot prize is only awarded for 1 of those 10,648 possible combinations. Henc, the probability of winning the jackpot is 1 in 10,648 but the jackpot only pays odds of 10,000 to 1. Over time the casino should make a profit from this slot game–unless the random factors influencing the outcome of the slot game just accidentally work against the casino.  Two random factors influence how a slot game’s spins are determined:  The first random factor is the mechanism used to spin the reels. In most if not all slot games today this is accomplished by pulling random numbers from a special chip. The chip continually generates new random numbers that are temporarily stored where the game can get them.  The second random factor is when players play the slot game. The slot game may “burn through” a lot of random numbers throughout the day. It only uses numbers when players spin the reels. These dual random factors combined with the large number of possible outcomes make slot games more chaotic than games like blackjack and roulette.   Player Decisions are Always a Random Factor in any Game  Although we do speak of the skill that one can acquire for a game like blackjack or poker, skills have limited direct impact on how these games are won or lost. That may seem counter-intuitive, but it’s simple:  In a card game two players of equal skill are limited by the random shuffling of the cards. A player with greater knowledge of the game is more likely to make better choices than a player with less knowledge of the game. Nonetheless players are not really paid on the basis of what they hold in their hands in card games. They are paid on the basis of how much they bet and who finishes a round with the highest value hand (or in order of value for split pot games).  In video poker, the value of the hand plays a direct role in determining how much the player is paid. Still, the player has to decide which cards to hold or replace in video poker.  In blackjack, the more players there are at a table the more random decisions influence where the next card is dealt. The dealer’s randomness is limited by house rules on where the dealer must stand or draw.  How can we Estimate our Chances of Winning ?  If probabilities don’t predict game outcomes and odds are worse at predicting your chances of winning than the probabilities, how do you assess your chances of winning? Fuzzy logic offers one way forward, where you compare the most likely outcomes with the least likely outcomes. We cannot precisely measure likelihood, but we can measure things that influence it.  We said that chance is that unmeasurable potential for the outcome that you desire. Surely your chances of winning at roulette are better if you take an outside bet than if you bet on a single number. There is less potential variability in the outcome of the game. You cover more numbers with an outside bet at the cost of winning a smaller prize.  And your chances of winning in blackjack are better if you follow the advice of standard probability tables than if you just “wing it” when deciding whether to stand or draw. Again, there is less potential variability in the outcome of the game because you are reducing randomness. But the game’s transparency is balanced by the relatively low prizes you win. You can only affect the randomness of your own choices. Hence, your chances of winning or losing are only partially under your control. But there is another way that you influence your chances of winning, and that is through your money management.  If you only look at the value of the prizes you want to win then playing maximum wagers on every round increases the chance of winning the largest possible prize. In the worst case scenario you lose every round and your stake is quickly depleted. On the other hand if you play to preserve your stake then minimum wagers are the best strategy because you risk the least on each bet.  The following decision table aligns the pros and cons with each strategy:    Maximum Bets                                            Minimum Bets  Better chances of winning more                 Worse chances of winning more  Fewer chances to win                                   More chances of winning  Here the fuzzy logic is obvious. We cannot compute digital probabilities but we know what is more likely to happen based on our money management strategy. We are indirectly inferring our chances of success by measuring that success in terms of possible outcomes, not in terms of the possibility of outcomes. We use the best case scenario to determine the upper bounds of our success and the worst case scenario to determine the lower bounds of our failures.  We can further qualify our chances by looking at mixed strategies:  Maximum Bets                Alternating Max / Min Bets            Minimum Bets  Best chances of                     Median chance of                       Worst chances of  winning more                        winning more                              winning more  Fewer chances to win           Median chances to win               Most chances to win  At this point it should be obvious that we could construct another table with five columns by adjusting the ratio of maximum to minimum bets (3:2 on the left, 2:3 on the right). We could extend this breakdown indefinitely without ever achieving any precision in predictability but improving our prediction in risk assessment. We cannot know in advance which strategy is best but we can decide which strategy we want to pursue.  Summary  Probabilities, odds, and chance are different things, but we use these terms interchangeably. There is really no harm done. Most people intuitively understand both the uncertainty of the outcomes of these games and the value of comparing the odds to the known probabilities.  When you don’t know the probabilities of a game, as when you play slots, then you can still fall back on fuzzy logic to give yourself some options. It’s a good idea to limit those options to no more than say 3 to 5. Too many choices become confusing and overwhelming.  You can use the fuzzy logic model to compare ratios of probabilities and odds instead of maximum to minimum bets. While there are no guarantees you’ll at least understand why your stake is growing or shrinking because you assessed the probabilities, odds, and chances in the best way possible.

In order to keep their doors open, land-based and online casinos are given the legal right by licensing authorities to plan an advantage into the game. Lawmakers and regulators realize casinos must maintain a house edge. This house edge doesn’t assure anything. A gambling establishment could maintain an advantage over the players, but it’s highly probable that the casino is going to win more than it loses.  The probable scenario might not play out in the short term, but over an extended period of time, the results should conform to the mathematical odds. All successful real money casinos operate on the principle that the house edge will make them profits. Like the motor in a vehicle, the house edge should produce revenues at a particular pace. When it does, a gambling house can afford to make the staff’s payroll, pay the utilities, maintain old equipment, buy new equipment, and cover all the various expenses of a gambling operation.  House Edge – An Engine of Profit  Of course, the casino’s profits are really a result of a great many games and machines, each with their own advantage for the operation. The casino sets a house edge on each gaming machine and table game, which all combined create a revenue stream. Management tries to find a balance between setting a house edge large enough to produce substantial profits, but small enough to keep gamblers interested in playing. If games don’t seem fair to the gamblers, they’ll eventually give up and go home. While laws stipulate a maximum limit for the house edge, most casinos set the expected return of their games at a much higher level, to lure players into their venue and keep them satisfied.  In fact, management sometimes offers game with an expected return at 100% or higher, meaning the player (if they’re smart) can expect to win more money than they wager. This is done for promotional purposes, to start a buzz in the gaming community, and should be looked at as an expense much like an advertising budget. Most casinos–especially those lone outfits away from the centers of gambling tourism–see no need to offer such great bargains. Therefore, when you gamble for real money, expect to face a house edge.  Secret Strategies  When the casino has a mathematical advantage over the gamblers, don’t expect to find some strategy which is going to beat that advantage. Though many people will tell you they have a real money gambling system to beat the casino, they don’t. The house edge is a mathematical law which can’t be broken. You might get lucky and beat the house edge for a while. You might get real lucky and beat the casino’s advantage for a long time–or beat it quite badly. If you play long enough, the house edge will beat you every single time. The so-called tricks which seem to beat the odds are nothing more than illusions produced by the random deviations of probability. Probabilistic results have a certain variance, and the house edge is set well within those variations in fortune, so a person can and will get lucky sometimes. Don’t let that fool you into thinking you’ve got a can’t-miss system to beat the dealer. You don’t.  Casino Games  Each game in the casino has a specific set of odds. It pays to know your chances of winning and losing when choosing a game to play. Ultimately, casino gambling is about playing for fun, entertainment, and thrills. Like any form of entertainment, you’re going to pay to be entertained. Unlike movies and football games and concerts, there’s a chance that you’ll have some luck at the gaming tables or slot machines and the gambling will pay for itself. When you play the games with the better odds, your chances of having that happen are greater. Below is an overview of the games and the odds you’ll face.  Texas Hold’em and Other Poker Variants  Poker is special study, because games like Texas hold’em do not pit the player versus the casino. No house edge exists when play Texas holdem, Omaha, or seven-card stud. It’s you against a table full of other individual players. Your skill and luck combine to determine whether you win or lose. This is why professional poker players can exist, because some people are simply better than other people at cards. Once again, that doesn’t assure they’ll win over the short haul. The cards could fall the wrong way and they lose their whole chip stack. But over the course of a pro poker player’s career, if they’re good enough, they’ll win more than they lose. They’ll win enough to play as a career.  Keep in mind that the house gets a “rake”. The rake is a fee or commission on each hand played. The dealer takes a certain amount of each pot, which the players agree to pay to the house for hosting the game, offering a dealer to deal cards, and otherwise officiate the proceedings. Besides this, gamblers often pay the dealer gratuities when they win. It’s considered good etiquette. Because of the rake, a poker player has to win at significantly more than a 100% return on the money they wager in order to be a successful player. So while a house edge doesn’t exist, the same principle applies. Poker is not just a game of chance, but also a game of skill, so it’s possible to beat the rake.  Blackjack  Blackjack has the lowest house edge of all games in the casino, with the possible exception of video poker . Below, I post the house edge for online casinos powered by some of the best UK and European casino software products. These games try to reproduce the brick-and-mortar experience fairly closely, so these conform somewhat to the odds you’ll find in live casinos.  Single-Deck Blackjack – 0.058% Blackjack Switch – 0.17% Vegas Strip Blackjack – 0.34% Atlantic City Blackjack – 0.35% Vegas Downtown Blackjack – 0.38% European Blackjack – 0.39% Multi-Hand Blackjack – 0.63% Double Exposure – 0.69%  I’m hesitant to post these numbers, because I’m afraid readers will skim and assume these are the hard-and-fast, universal odds for these games. Keep in mind that specific rules can change the odds significantly and game managers like to stick in a tricky little rule here or there, which weights the odds further in their favor. Always study the stated rules and have an idea of how these rules variations change the probabilities of the game.  Video Poker  Besides the 21 games above, video poker offers the best expected return of the games in the casino. Like twenty-one, video poker has dozens of game variants, too. With a full-pay loose deuces, deuces wild, or jacks or better video poker machine, you’ll be playing at a positive expectation. Don’t expect to find the full-pay machines too often, though, because it’s less common all the time.  Games of Skill – A Caveat  Games of skill like blackjack and video poker require strategy knowledge and optimal play in order to get the nice house edge. If you make bad decisions, the house edge rises. Blackjack players must study basic strategy charts for their variant of the game, while video poker gamblers must master their game, too. If you don’t have the time, patience, and memorization abilities to make these viable games, you might be better off playing games of chance which have decent odds.  Craps  Of all games which don’t require strategy, craps has the lowest effective house edge. If you play the pass/come bets in craps, the house edge is 1.41%. If you play the don’t pass/don’t come bets, the house edge is 1.35%. A social factor convinced many players to wager the pass/come bets, because if you bet the opposite, you’re betting against the shooter and most other gamblers at their table. While it’s not considered unfriendly, it certainly is considered bad manners if you win and celebrate, because you’re celebrating the other player’s misfortune.  These odds wouldn’t be better than baccarat and certain types of European roulette , except you also receive the option to make “odds” bets in craps. These wagers have a 0% house edge, though they can only be made in certain situations and the casino limits how much you can wager. If you make pass/come bets and take the odds, the house edge lowers to just under 1%. All other wagers in craps have a higher house edge (some much higher), so if you want to play with the best possibilities of winning, never make any other bets in craps.  Baccarat  Baccarat has several variants, so it’s hard to peg the house edge for each in our limited space. Baccarat has a house edge in the 1.40% range, so it’s not a bad bet for a game with no strategy. Of course, “Chemin de Fer” does offer a strategy component, but you won’t find it in many American casinos. Instead, you’ll be play punto banco and mini-baccarat, which have no strategy. If you want to make the optimal plays, always bet the banker hand instead of the player hand (when possible).  Roulette  European roulette has a house edge of 2.70%. If you play European or single-zero roulette with the “la partage” or “en prison” (imprisonment) rules, this lowers the house edge on the even-money wagers to 1.35%. Even-money wagers are the even/odd, black/red, and high/low bets. All others remain the same. French roulette games with the “called bets” or announced wagers have the same odds as the aforementioned European roulette. American roulette has a house edge of 5.26%, so I wouldn’t play this game in most circumstances. If you find double-zero roulette with the la partage or imprisonment rules, the house edge lowers to a manageable 2.63%, but you can still find better games in the casino.  Slot Machines  The odds on slot machines vary a lot. The house edge might be as low as 3%, but it can balloon to 10% or 15% in some places. Never play the slots at the airport, which have the worst odds you can imagine. The 3% house edge is likely to be for high stakes slot machines. Expect a house edge in the 5% to 8% for the most part. If you play a progressive or accumulated jackpot game, the house edge is going to be higher. The machine has to take the money from a lot of gamblers in order to pay off that one gambler with a life-changing jackpot.  Keno  The house edge on keno ranges between 4% and 30%, but expect something closer to the higher number unless you’re in Las Vegas. Unless you have specific information which tells you the keno games have a low house edge, I can’t imagine why someone would prefer to play keno to most other games in the casino.

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back 
        to Top  Casino 
        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back

        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back

        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back

        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

        Tables for House Advantage    Introduction  At its core the business of 
        casino gaming is pretty simple. Casinos make money on their games because 
        of the mathematics behind the games. As Nico Zographos, dealer-extraordinaire 
        for the 'Greek Syndicate' in Deauville, Cannes, and Monte Carlo in the 
        1920s observed about casino gaming: "There is no such thing as luck. 
        It is all mathematics."  With a few notable exceptions, 
        the house always wins - in the long run - because of the mathematical 
        advantage the casino enjoys over the player. That is what Mario Puzo was 
        referring to in his famous novel Fools Die when his fictional casino boss 
        character, Gronevelt, commented: "Percentages never lie. We built 
        all these hotels on percentages. We stay rich on the percentage. You can 
        lose faith in everything, religion and God, women and love, good and evil, 
        war and peace. You name it. But the percentage will always stand fast."  Puzo is, of course, right on 
        the money about casino gaming. Without the "edge," casinos would 
        not exist. With this edge, and because of a famous mathematical result 
        called the law of large numbers, a casino is guaranteed to win in the 
        long run.  Back 
        to Top  Why is 
        Mathematics Important?  Critics of the gaming industry 
        have long accused it of creating the name "gaming" and using 
        this as more politically correct than calling itself the "gambling 
        industry." The term "gaming," however, has been around 
        for centuries and more accurately describes the operators' view of the 
        industry because most often casino operators are not gambling. Instead, 
        they rely on mathematical principles to assure that their establishment 
        generates positive gross gaming revenues. The operator, however, must 
        assure the gaming revenues are sufficient to cover deductions like bad 
        debts, expenses, employees, taxes and interest.  Despite the obvious, many casino 
        professionals limit their advancements by failing to understand the basic 
        mathematics of the games and their relationships to casino profitability. 
        One casino owner would often test his pit bosses by asking how a casino 
        could make money on blackjack if the outcome is determined simply by whether 
        the player or the dealer came closest to 21. The answer, typically, was 
        because the casino maintained "a house advantage." This was 
        fair enough, but many could not identify the amount of that advantage 
        or what aspect of the game created the advantage. Given that products 
        offered by casinos are games, managers must understand why the games provide 
        the expected revenues. In the gaming industry, nothing plays a more important 
        role than mathematics.  Mathematics should also overcome 
        the dangers of superstitions. An owner of a major Las Vegas strip casino 
        once experienced a streak of losing substantial amounts of money to a 
        few "high rollers." He did not attribute this losing streak 
        to normal volatility in the games, but to bad luck. His solution was simple. 
        He spent the evening spreading salt throughout the casino to ward off 
        the bad spirits. Before attributing this example to the idiosyncrasies 
        of one owner, his are atypical only in their extreme. Superstition has 
        long been a part of gambling - from both sides of the table. Superstitions 
        can lead to irrational decisions that may hurt casino profits. For example, 
        believing that a particular dealer is unlucky against a particular (winning) 
        player may lead to a decision to change dealers. As many, if not most, 
        players are superstitious. At best, he may resent that the casino is trying 
        to change his luck. At worst, the player may feel the new dealer is skilled 
        in methods to "cool" the game. Perhaps he is even familiar with 
        stories of old where casinos employed dealers to cheat "lucky" 
        players.  Understanding the mathematics 
        of a game also is important for the casino operator to ensure that the 
        reasonable expectations of the players are met. For most persons, gambling 
        is entertainment. It provides an outlet for adult play. As such, persons 
        have the opportunity for a pleasant diversion from ordinary life and from 
        societal and personal pressures. As an entertainment alternative, however, 
        players may consider the value of the gambling experience. For example, 
        some people may have the option of either spending a hundred dollars during 
        an evening by going to a professional basketball game or at a licensed 
        casino. If the house advantage is too strong and the person loses his 
        money too quickly, he may not value that casino entertainment experience. 
        On the other hand, if a casino can entertain him for an evening, and he 
        enjoys a "complimentary" meal or drinks, he may want to repeat 
        the experience, even over a professional basketball game. Likewise, new 
        casino games themselves may succeed or fail based on player expectations. 
        In recent years, casinos have debuted a variety of new games that attempt 
        to garner player interest and keep their attention. Regardless of whether 
        a game is fun or interesting to play, most often a player will not want 
        to play games where his money is lost too quickly or where he has a exceptionally 
        remote chance of returning home with winnings.  Mathematics also plays an important 
        part in meeting players' expectations as to the possible consequences 
        of his gambling activities. If gambling involves rational decision-making, 
        it would appear irrational to wager money where your opponent has a better 
        chance of winning than you do. Adam Smith suggested that all gambling, 
        where the operator has an advantage, is irrational. He wrote "There 
        is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the 
        more tickets [in a lottery] you advertise upon, the more likely you are 
        a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for 
        certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach 
        to this certainty."  Even where the house has an 
        advantage, however, a gambler may be justified if the amount lost means 
        little to him, but the potential gain would elevate him to a higher standing 
        of living. For example, a person with an annual income of $30,000 may 
        have $5 in disposable weekly income. He could save or gamble this money. 
        By saving it, at the end of a year, he would have $260. Even if he did 
        this for years, the savings would not elevate his economic status to another 
        level. As an alternative, he could use the $5 to gamble for the chance 
        to win $1 million. While the odds of winning are remote, it may provide 
        the only opportunity to move to a higher economic class.  Since the casino industry is 
        heavily regulated and some of the standards set forth by regulatory bodies 
        involve mathematically related issues, casino managers also should understand 
        the mathematical aspects relating to gaming regulation. Gaming regulation 
        is principally dedicated to assuring that the games offered in the casino 
        are fair, honest, and that players get paid if they win. Fairness is often 
        expressed in the regulations as either requiring a minimum payback to 
        the player or, in more extreme cases, as dictating the actual rules of 
        the games offered. Casino executives should understand the impact that 
        rules changes have on the payback to players to assure they meet regulatory 
        standards. Equally important, casino executives should understand how 
        government mandated rules would impact their gaming revenues.  Back 
        to Top  The House 
        Edge  The player's chances of winning 
        in a casino game and the rate at which he wins or loses money depends 
        on the game, the rules in effect for that game, and for some games his 
        level of skill. The amount of money the player can expect to win or lose 
        in the long run - if the bet is made over and over again - is called the 
        player's wager expected value (EV), or expectation. When the player's 
        wager expectation is negative, he will lose money in the long run. For 
        a $5 bet on the color red in roulette, for example, the expectation is 
        -$0.263. On the average the player will lose just over a quarter for each 
        $5 bet on red.  When the wager expectation 
        is viewed from the casino's perspective (i.e., the negative of the player's 
        expectation) and expressed as a percentage, you have the house advantage. 
        For the roulette example, the house advantage is 5.26% ($0.263 divided 
        by $5). The formal calculation is as follows:  EV = (+5)(18/38) + (-5)(20/38) 
        = -0.263 (House Advantage = 0.263/5 = 5.26%)  When this EV calculation is 
        performed for a 1-unit amount, the negative of the resulting value is 
        the house edge. Here are the calculations for bets on a single-number 
        in double-zero and single-zero roulette.  Double-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/38) + (-1)(37/38) = -0.053 (House Advantage = 5.3%)  Single-zero roulette (single 
        number bet): EV = (+35)(1/37) + (-1)(36/37) = -0.027 (House Advantage = 2.7%)  The house advantage represents 
        the long run percentage of the wagered money that will be retained by 
        the casino. It is also called the house edge, the "odds" (i.e., 
        avoid games with bad odds), or just the "percentage" (as in 
        Mario Puzo's Fools Die). Although the house edge can be computed easily 
        for some games - for example, roulette and craps - for others it requires 
        more sophisticated mathematical analysis and/or computer simulations. 
        Regardless of the method used to compute it, the house advantage represents 
        the price to the player of playing the game.  Because this positive house 
        edge exists for virtually all bets in a casino (ignoring the poker room 
        and sports book where a few professionals can make a living), gamblers 
        are faced with an uphill and, in the long run, losing battle. There are 
        some exceptions. The odds bet in craps has zero house edge (although this 
        bet cannot be made without making another negative expectation wager) 
        and there are a few video poker machines that return greater than 100% 
        if played with perfect strategy. Occasionally the casino will even offer 
        a promotion that gives the astute player a positive expectation. These 
        promotions are usually mistakes - sometimes casinos don't check the math 
        - and are terminated once the casino realizes the player has the edge. 
        But by and large the player will lose money in the long run, and the house 
        edge is a measure of how fast the money will be lost. A player betting 
        in a game with a 4% house advantage will tend to lose his money twice 
        as fast as a player making bets with a 2% house edge. The trick to intelligent 
        casino gambling - at least from the mathematical expectation point of 
        view - is to avoid the games and bets with the large house advantages.  Some casino games are pure 
        chance - no amount of skill or strategy can alter the odds. These games 
        include roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, the big-six wheel of fortune, 
        and slot machines. Of these, baccarat and craps offer the best odds, with 
        house advantages of 1.2% and less than 1% (assuming only pass/come with 
        full odds), respectively. Roulette and slots cost the player more - house 
        advantages of 5.3% for double-zero roulette and 5% to 10% for slots - 
        while the wheel of fortune feeds the casino near 20% of the wagers, and 
        keno is a veritable casino cash cow with average house advantage close 
        to 30%.  Games where an element of skill 
        can affect the house advantage include blackjack, video poker, and the 
        four popular poker-based table games: Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, 
        Three Card poker, and Pai Gow poker. For the poker games, optimal strategy 
        results in a house edge in the 3% to 5% range (CSP has the largest house 
        edge, PGP the lowest, with LIR and TCP in between). For video poker the 
        statistical advantage varies depending on the particular machine, but 
        generally this game can be very player friendly - house edge less than 
        3% is not uncommon and some are less than 1% - if played with expert strategy.  Blackjack, the most popular 
        of all table games, offers the skilled player some of the best odds in 
        the casino. The house advantage varies slightly depending on the rules 
        and number of decks, but a player using basic strategy faces little or 
        no disadvantage in a single-deck game and only a 0.5% house edge in the 
        common six-deck game. Despite these numbers, the average player ends up 
        giving the casino a 2% edge due to mistakes and deviations from basic 
        strategy. Complete basic strategy tables can be found in many books and 
        many casino-hotel gift shops sell color-coded credit card size versions. 
        Rule variations favorable to the player include fewer decks, dealer stands 
        on soft seventeen (worth 0.2%), doubling after splitting (0.14%), late 
        surrender (worth 0.06%), and early surrender (uncommon, but worth 0.24%). 
        If the dealer hits soft seventeen it will cost you, as will any restrictions 
        on when you can double down.  Back 
        to Top  Probability 
        versus Odds  Probability represents the 
        long run ratio of (# of times an outcome occurs) to (# of times experiment 
        is conducted). Odds represent the long run ratio of (# of times an outcome 
        does not occur) to (# of times an outcome occurs). If a card is randomly 
        selected from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability it 
        is a spade is 1/4; the odds (against spade) are 3 to 1. The true odds 
        of an event represent the payoff that would make the bet on that event 
        fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has 
        probability of 1/38, so to break even in the long run a player would have 
        to be paid 37 to 1 (the actual payoff is 35 to 1).  Back 
        to Top  Confusion 
        about Win Rate  There are all kinds of percentages 
        in the world of gaming. Win percentage, theoretical win percentage, hold 
        percentage, and house advantage come to mind. Sometimes casino bosses 
        use these percentages interchangeably, as if they are just different names 
        for the same thing. Admittedly, in some cases this is correct. House advantage 
        is just another name for theoretical win percentage, and for slot machines, 
        hold percentage is (in principle) equivalent to win percentage. But there 
        are fundamental differences among these win rate measurements.  The house advantage - the all-important 
        percentage that explains how casinos make money - is also called the house 
        edge, the theoretical win percentage, and expected win percentage. In 
        double-zero roulette, this figure is 5.3%. In the long run the house will 
        retain 5.3% of the money wagered. In the short term, of course, the actual 
        win percentage will differ from the theoretical win percentage (the magnitude 
        of this deviation can be predicted from statistical theory). The actual 
        win percentage is just the (actual) win divided by the handle. Because 
        of the law of large numbers - or as some prefer to call it, the law of 
        averages - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual win percentage 
        should get closer to the theoretical win percentage.  Because handle can be difficult 
        to measure for table games, performance is often measured by hold percentage 
        (and sometimes erroneously called win percentage). Hold percentage is 
        equal to win divided by drop. In Nevada, this figure is about 24% for 
        roulette. The drop and hold percentage are affected by many factors; we 
        won't delve into these nor the associated management issues. Suffice it 
        to say that the casino will not in the long term keep 24% of the money 
        bet on the spins of roulette wheel - well, an honest casino won't.  To summarize: House advantage 
        and theoretical win percentage are the same thing, hold percentage is 
        win over drop, win percentage is win over handle, win percentage approaches 
        the house advantage as the number of plays increases, and hold percentage 
        is equivalent to win percentage for slots but not table games.  · Hold % = Win/Drop · Win % (actual) = Win/Handle · H.A. = Theoretical Win % = Limit(Actual Win %) = Limit(Win/Handle) · Hold Percentage ¹ House Edge  Furthermore, the house advantage 
        is itself subject to varying interpretations. In Let It Ride, for example, 
        the casino advantage is either 3.51% or 2.86% depending on whether you 
        express the advantage with respect to the base bet or the average bet. 
        Those familiar with the game know that the player begins with three equal 
        base bets, but may withdraw one or two of these initial units. The final 
        amount put at risk, then, can be one (84.6% of the time assuming proper 
        strategy), two (8.5%), or three units (6.9%), making the average bet size 
        1.224 units. In the long run, the casino will win 3.51% of the hands, 
        which equates to 2.86% of the money wagered. So what's the house edge 
        for Let It Ride? Some prefer to say 3.51% per hand, others 2.86% per unit 
        wagered. No matter. Either way, the bottom line is the same either way: 
        assuming three $1 base bets, the casino can expect to earn 3.5¢ per 
        hand (note that 1.224 x 0.0286 = 0.035).  The question of whether to 
        use the base bet or average bet size also arises in Caribbean Stud Poker 
        (5.22% vs. 2.56%), Three Card Poker (3.37% vs. 2.01%), Casino War (2.88% 
        vs. 2.68%), and Red Dog (2.80% vs. 2.37%).  For still other games, the 
        house edge can be stated including or excluding ties. The prime examples 
        here are the player (1.24% vs. 1.37%) and banker (1.06% vs. 1.17%) bets 
        in baccarat, and the don't pass bet (1.36% vs. 1.40%) in craps. Again, 
        these are different views on the casino edge, but the expected revenue 
        will not change.  That the house advantage can 
        appear in different disguises might be unsettling. When properly computed 
        and interpreted, however, regardless of which representation is chosen, 
        the same truth (read: money) emerges: expected win is the same.  Back 
        to Top  Volatility 
        and Risk  Statistical theory can be used 
        to predict the magnitude of the difference between the actual win percentage 
        and the theoretical win percentage for a given number of wagers. When 
        observing the actual win percentage a player (or casino) may experience, 
        how much variation from theoretical win can be expected? What is a normal 
        fluctuation? The basis for the analysis of such volatility questions is 
        a statistical measure called the standard deviation (essentially the average 
        deviation of all possible outcomes from the expected). Together with the 
        central limit theorem (a form of the law of large numbers), the standard 
        deviation (SD) can be used to determine confidence limits with the following 
        volatility guidelines:  Volatility Analysis Guidelines · Only 5% of the time will outcomes will be more than 2 SD's from 
        expected outcome · Almost never (0.3%) will outcomes be more than 3 SD's from expected 
        outcome  Obviously a key to using these 
        guidelines is the value of the SD. Computing the SD value is beyond the 
        scope of this article, but to get an idea behind confidence limits, consider 
        a series of 1,000 pass line wagers in craps. Since each wager has a 1.4% 
        house advantage, on average the player will be behind by 14 units. It 
        can be shown (calculations omitted) that the wager standard deviation 
        is for a single pass line bet is 1.0, and for 1,000 wagers the SD is 31.6. 
        Applying the volatility guidelines, we can say that there is a 95% chance 
        the player's actual win will be between 49 units ahead and 77 units behind, 
        and almost certainly between 81 units ahead and 109 units behind.  A similar analysis for 1,000 
        single-number wagers on double-zero roulette (on average the player will 
        be behind 53 units, wager SD = 5.8, 1,000 wager SD = 182.2) will yield 
        95% confidence limits on the player win of 311 units ahead and 417 units 
        behind, with win almost certainly between 494 units ahead and 600 units 
        behind.  Note that if the volatility 
        analysis is done in terms of the percentage win (rather than the number 
        of units or amount won), the confidence limits will converge to the house 
        advantage as the number of wagers increases. This is the result of the 
        law of large numbers - as the number of trials gets larger, the actual 
        win percentage should get closer to the theoretical win percentage. Risk 
        in the gaming business depends on the house advantage, standard deviation, 
        bet size, and length of play.  Back 
        to Top  Player 
        Value and Complimentaries  Using the house advantage, 
        bet size, duration of play, and pace of the game, a casino can determine 
        how much it expects to win from a certain player. This player earning 
        potential (also called player value, player worth, or theoretical win) 
        can be calculated by the formula:  Earning Potential = Average 
        Bet ´ Hours Played ´ Decisions per Hour ´ House Advantage  For example, suppose a baccarat 
        player bets $500 per hand for 12 hours at 60 hands per hour. Using a house 
        advantage of 1.2%, this player's worth to the casino is $4,320 (500 ´ 
        12 ´ 60 ´ .012). A player who bets $500 per spin for 12 hours 
        in double-zero roulette at 60 spins per hour would be worth about $19,000 
        (500 ´ 12 ´ 60 ´ .053).  Many casinos set comp (complimentary) 
        policies by giving the player back a set percentage of their earning potential. 
        Although comp and rebate policies based on theoretical loss are the most 
        popular, rebates on actual losses and dead chip programs are also used 
        in some casinos. Some programs involve a mix of systems. The mathematics 
        associated with these programs will not be addressed in this article.  Back

        Pricing Mistakes  In an effort to entice players 
        and increase business, casinos occasionally offer novel wagers, side bets, 
        increased payoffs, or rule variations. These promotions have the effect 
        of lowering the house advantage and the effective price of the game for 
        the player. This is sound reasoning from a marketing standpoint, but can 
        be disastrous for the casino if care is not taken to ensure the math behind 
        the promotion is sound. One casino offered a baccarat commission on winning 
        banker bets of only 2% instead of the usual 5%, resulting in a 0.32% player 
        advantage. This is easy to see (using the well-known probabilities of 
        winning and losing the banker bet):  EV = (+0.98)(.4462) + (-1)(.4586) 
        = 0.0032 (House Advantage = -0.32%)  A casino in Biloxi, Mississippi 
        gave players a 12.5% edge on Sic Bo bets of 4 and 17 when they offered 
        80 to 1 payoffs instead of the usual 60 to 1. Again, this is an easy calculation. 
        Using the fact that the probability of rolling a total of 4 (same calculation 
        applies for a total of 17) with three dice is 1/72 (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 
        3), here are the expected values for both the usual and the promotional 
        payoffs:  Usual 60 to 1 payoff: EV = 
        (+60)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = -0.153 (House Advantage = 15.3%)  Promotional 80 to 1 payoff: 
        EV = (+80)(1/72) + (-1)(71/72) = +0.125 (House Advantage = -12.5%)  In other promotional gaffes, 
        an Illinois riverboat casino lost a reported $200,000 in one day with 
        their "2 to 1 Tuesdays" that paid players 2 to 1 (the usual 
        payoff is 3 to 2) on blackjack naturals, a scheme that gave players a 
        2% advantage. Not to be outdone, an Indian casino in California paid 3 
        to 1 on naturals during their "happy hour," offered three times 
        a day, two days a week for over two weeks. This promotion gave the player 
        a whopping 6% edge. A small Las Vegas casino offered a blackjack rule 
        variation called the "Free Ride" in which players were given 
        a free right-to-surrender token every time they received a natural. Proper 
        use of the token led to a player edge of 1.3%, and the casino lost an 
        estimated $17,000 in eight hours. Another major Las Vegas casino offered 
        a "50/50 Split" blackjack side bet that allowed the player to 
        stand on an initial holding of 12-16, and begin a new hand for equal stakes 
        against the same dealer up card. Although the game marketers claimed the 
        variation was to the advantage of the casino, it turned out that players 
        who exercised the 50/50 Split only against dealer 2-6 had a 2% advantage. 
        According to one pit boss, the casino suffered a $230,000 loss in three 
        and a half days.  In the gaming business, it's 
        all about "bad math" or "good math." Honest games 
        based on good math with positive house advantage minimize the short-term 
        risk and ensure the casino will make money in the long run. Players will 
        get "lucky" in the short term, but that is all part of the grand 
        design. Fluctuations in both directions will occur. We call these fluctuations 
        good luck or bad luck depending on the direction of the fluctuation. There 
        is no such thing as luck. It is all mathematics.  Back

        Regulation and Mathematics  Casino gaming is one of the 
        most regulated industries in the world. Most gaming regulatory systems 
        share common objectives: keep the games fair and honest and assure that 
        players are paid if they win. Fairness and honesty are different concepts. 
        A casino can be honest but not fair. Honesty refers to whether the casino 
        offers games whose chance elements are random. Fairness refers to the 
        game advantage - how much of each dollar wagered should the casino be 
        able to keep? A slot machine that holds, on average, 90% of every dollar 
        bet is certainly not fair, but could very well be honest (if the outcomes 
        of each play are not predetermined in the casino's favor). Two major regulatory 
        issues relating to fairness and honesty - ensuring random outcomes and 
        controlling the house advantage - are inextricably tied to mathematics 
        and most regulatory bodies require some type of mathematical analysis 
        to demonstrate game advantage and/or confirm that games outcomes are random. 
        Such evidence can range from straightforward probability analyses to computer 
        simulations and complex statistical studies. Requirements vary across 
        jurisdictions, but it is not uncommon to see technical language in gaming 
        regulations concerning specific statistical tests that must be performed, 
        confidence limits that must be met, and other mathematical specifications 
        and standards relating to game outcomes.  Back

(September 2007)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The mathematics of gambling are a collection of probability applications encountered in games of chance and can be included in game theory . From a mathematical point of view, the games of chance are experiments generating various types of aleatory events, the probability of which can be calculated by using the properties of probability on a finite space of events.

Here are a few examples:   Throwing the dice in craps is an experiment that generates events such as occurrences of certain numbers on the dice, obtaining a certain sum of the shown numbers, and obtaining numbers with certain properties (less than a specific number, higher than a specific number, even, uneven, and so on). The sample space of such an experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for rolling one die or {(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), ..., (2, 6), ..., (6, 1), (6, 2), ..., (6, 6)} for rolling two dice. The latter is a set of ordered pairs and counts 6 x 6 = 36 elements. The events can be identified with sets, namely parts of the sample space. For example, the event occurrence of an even number is represented by the following set in the experiment of rolling one die: {2, 4, 6}.  Spinning the roulette wheel is an experiment whose generated events could be the occurrence of a certain number, of a certain color or a certain property of the numbers (low, high, even, uneven, from a certain row or column, and so on). The sample space of the experiment involving spinning the roulette wheel is the set of numbers the roulette holds: {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0, 00} for the American roulette, or {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0} for the European. The event occurrence of a red number is represented by the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36}. These are the numbers inscribed in red on the roulette wheel and table.  Dealing cards in blackjack is an experiment that generates events such as the occurrence of a certain card or value as the first card dealt, obtaining a certain total of points from the first two cards dealt, exceeding 21 points from the first three cards dealt, and so on. In card games we encounter many types of experiments and categories of events. Each type of experiment has its own sample space. For example, the experiment of dealing the first card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104, if played with two decks). The experiment of dealing the second card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104), less the first card dealt. The experiment of dealing the first two cards to the first player has as its sample space a set of ordered pairs, namely all the 2-size arrangements of cards from the 52 (or 104). In a game with one player, the event the player is dealt a card of 10 points as the first dealt card is represented by the set of cards {10♠, 10♣, 10♥, 10♦, J♠, J♣, J♥, J♦, Q♠, Q♣, Q♥, Q♦, K♠, K♣, K♥, K♦}. The event the player is dealt a total of five points from the first two dealt cards is represented by the set of 2-size combinations of card values {(A, 4), (2, 3)}, which in fact counts 4 x 4 + 4 x 4 = 32 combinations of cards (as value and symbol).  In 6/49 lottery , the experiment of drawing six numbers from the 49 generates events such as drawing six specific numbers, drawing five numbers from six specific numbers, drawing four numbers from six specific numbers, drawing at least one number from a certain group of numbers, etc. The sample space here is the set of all 6-size combinations of numbers from the 49.  In draw poker , the experiment of dealing the initial five card hands generates events such as dealing at least one certain card to a specific player, dealing a pair to at least two players, dealing four identical symbols to at least one player, and so on. The sample space in this case is the set of all 5-card combinations from the 52 (or the deck used).  Dealing two cards to a player who has discarded two cards is another experiment whose sample space is now the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the cards seen by the observer who solves the probability problem. For example, if you are in play in the above situation and want to figure out some odds regarding your hand, the sample space you should consider is the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the three cards you hold and less the two cards you discarded. This sample space counts the 2-size combinations from 47.   The probability model [ edit ]  A probability model starts from an experiment and a mathematical structure attached to that experiment, namely the space (field) of events. The event is the main unit probability theory works on. In gambling, there are many categories of events, all of which can be textually predefined. In the previous examples of gambling experiments we saw some of the events that experiments generate. They are a minute part of all possible events, which in fact is the set of all parts of the sample space.  For a specific game, the various types of events can be:   Events related to your own play or to opponents’ play;  Events related to one person’s play or to several persons’ play;  Immediate events or long-shot events.   Each category can be further divided into several other subcategories, depending on the game referred to. These events can be literally defined, but it must be done very carefully when framing a probability problem. From a mathematical point of view, the events are nothing more than subsets and the space of events is a Boolean algebra . Among these events, we find elementary and compound events, exclusive and nonexclusive events, and independent and non-independent events.  In the experiment of rolling a die:   Event {3, 5} (whose literal definition is occurrence of 3 or 5 ) is compound because {3, 5}= {3} U {5};  Events {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} are elementary;  Events {3, 5} and {4} are incompatible or exclusive because their intersection is empty; that is, they cannot occur simultaneously;  Events {1, 2, 5} and {2, 5} are nonexclusive, because their intersection is not empty;  In the experiment of rolling two dice one after another, the events obtaining 3 on the first die and obtaining 5 on the second die are independent because the occurrence of the second event is not influenced by the occurrence of the first, and vice versa.   In the experiment of dealing the pocket cards in Texas Hold’em Poker:   The event of dealing (3♣, 3♦) to a player is an elementary event;  The event of dealing two 3’s to a player is compound because is the union of events (3♣, 3♠), (3♣, 3♥), (3♣, 3♦), (3♠, 3♥), (3♠, 3♦) and (3♥, 3♦);  The events player 1 is dealt a pair of kings and player 2 is dealt a pair of kings are nonexclusive (they can both occur);  The events player 1 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J and player 2 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J are exclusive (only one can occur);  The events player 1 is dealt (7, K) and player 2 is dealt (4, Q) are non-independent (the occurrence of the second depends on the occurrence of the first, while the same deck is in use).   These are a few examples of gambling events, whose properties of compoundness, exclusiveness and independency are easily observable. These properties are very important in practical probability calculus.  The complete mathematical model is given by the probability field attached to the experiment, which is the triple sample space—field of events—probability function . For any game of chance, the probability model is of the simplest type—the sample space is finite, the space of events is the set of parts of the sample space, implicitly finite, too, and the probability function is given by the definition of probability on a finite space of events:  Combinations [ edit ]  Games of chance are also good examples of combinations , permutations and arrangements, which are met at every step: combinations of cards in a player’s hand, on the table or expected in any card game; combinations of numbers when rolling several dice once; combinations of numbers in lottery and bingo; combinations of symbols in slots; permutations and arrangements in a race to be bet on, and the like. Combinatorial calculus is an important part of gambling probability applications. In games of chance, most of the gambling probability calculus in which we use the classical definition of probability reverts to counting combinations. The gaming events can be identified with sets, which often are sets of combinations. Thus, we can identify an event with a combination.  For example, in a five draw poker game, the event at least one player holds a four of a kind formation can be identified with the set of all combinations of (xxxxy) type, where x and y are distinct values of cards. This set has 13C(4,4)(52-4)=624 combinations. Possible combinations are (3♠ 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ J♣) or (7♠ 7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 2♣). These can be identified with elementary events that the event to be measured consists of.  Expectation and strategy [ edit ]  Games of chance are not merely pure applications of probability calculus and gaming situations are not just isolated events whose numerical probability is well established through mathematical methods; they are also games whose progress is influenced by human action. In gambling, the human element has a striking character. The player is not only interested in the mathematical probability of the various gaming events, but he or she has expectations from the games while a major interaction exists. To obtain favorable results from this interaction, gamblers take into account all possible information, including statistics , to build gaming strategies. The predicted average gain or loss is called expectation or expected value and is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the experiment multiplied by its payoff (value). Thus, it represents the average amount one expects to win per bet if bets with identical odds are repeated many times. A game or situation in which the expected value for the player is zero (no net gain nor loss) is called a fair game. The attribute fair refers not to the technical process of the game, but to the chance balance house (bank)–player.  Even though the randomness inherent in games of chance would seem to ensure their fairness (at least with respect to the players around a table—shuffling a deck or spinning a wheel do not favor any player except if they are fraudulent), gamblers always search and wait for irregularities in this randomness that will allow them to win. It has been mathematically proved that, in ideal conditions of randomness, and with negative expectation, no long-run regular winning is possible for players of games of chance. Most gamblers accept this premise, but still work on strategies to make them win either in the short term or over the long run.  House advantage or edge [ edit ]  Casino games provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or "house", while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called "random with a tactical element." While it is possible through skilful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the house edge or house vigorish ) in a casino game. Common belief is that such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of wheel clocking in Roulette. For more examples see Advantage gambling .  The player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's "true odds", which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 5 times the amount wagered since there is a 1/6 probability of any single number appearing. However, the casino may only pay 4 times the amount wagered for a winning wager.  The house edge (HE) or vigorish is defined as the casino profit expressed as a percentage of the player's original bet. In games such as Blackjack or Spanish 21 , the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player doubles or splits.  Example: In American Roulette , there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). If a player bets $1 on red, his chance of winning $1 is therefore 18/38 and his chance of losing $1 (or winning -$1) is 20/38.  The player's expected value, EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 rounds, play $1 per round, the average house profit will be 10 x $1 x 5.26% = $0.53. Of course, it is not possible for the casino to win exactly 53 cents; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting 10 rounds at $1 per round.  The house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game. Keno can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines can have up to 15%, while most Australian Pontoon games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.  The calculation of the Roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.  In games which have a skill element, such as Blackjack or Spanish 21 , the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as card counting or shuffle tracking ), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as "basic strategy" and is highly dependent on the specific rules, and even the number of decks used. Good Blackjack and Spanish 21 games have house edges below 0.5%.  Online slot games often have a published Return to Player (RTP) percentage that determines the theoretical house edge. Some software developers choose to publish the RTP of their slot games while others do not. [1] Despite the set theoretical RTP, almost any outcome is possible in the short term. [2]  Standard deviation [ edit ]  The luck factor in a casino game is quantified using standard deviation (SD). The standard deviation of a simple game like Roulette can be simply calculated because of the binomial distribution of successes (assuming a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss). For the binomial distribution, SD is equal to       n  p  q      {\displaystyle {\sqrt {npq}}}   , where     n    {\displaystyle n}   is the number of rounds played,     p    {\displaystyle p}   is the probability of winning, and     q    {\displaystyle q}   is the probability of losing. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold. Therefore, SD for Roulette even-money bet is equal to     2  b    n  p  q      {\displaystyle 2b{\sqrt {npq}}}   , where     b    {\displaystyle b}   is the flat bet per round,     n    {\displaystyle n}   is the number of rounds,     p  =  18   /   38    {\displaystyle p=18/38}   , and     q  =  20   /   38    {\displaystyle q=20/38}   .  After enough large number of rounds the theoretical distribution of the total win converges to the normal distribution , giving a good possibility to forecast the possible win or loss. For example, after 100 rounds at $1 per round, the standard deviation of the win (equally of the loss) will be     2  ⋅  $  1  ⋅    100  ⋅  18   /   38  ⋅  20   /   38    ≈  $  9.99    {\displaystyle 2\cdot \$1\cdot {\sqrt {100\cdot 18/38\cdot 20/38}}\approx \$9.99}   . After 100 rounds, the expected loss will be     100  ⋅  $  1  ⋅  2   /   38  ≈  $  5.26    {\displaystyle 100\cdot \$1\cdot 2/38\approx \$5.26}   .  The 3 sigma range is six times the standard deviation: three above the mean, and three below. Therefore, after 100 rounds betting $1 per round, the result will very probably be somewhere between     −  $  5.26  −  3  ⋅  $  9.99    {\displaystyle -\$5.26-3\cdot \$9.99}   and     −  $  5.26  +  3  ⋅  $  9.99    {\displaystyle -\$5.26+3\cdot \$9.99}   , i.e., between -$34 and $24. There is still a ca. 1 to 400 chance that the result will be not in this range, i.e. either the win will exceed $24, or the loss will exceed $34.  The standard deviation for the even-money Roulette bet is one of the lowest out of all casinos games. Most games, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.  Unfortunately, the above considerations for small numbers of rounds are incorrect, because the distribution is far from normal. Moreover, the results of more volatile games usually converge to the normal distribution much more slowly, therefore much more huge number of rounds are required for that.  As the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is practically impossible for a gambler to win in the long term (if they don't have an edge). It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win.  The volatility index (VI) is defined as the standard deviation for one round, betting one unit. Therefore, the VI for the even-money American Roulette bet is       18   /   38  ⋅  20   /   38    ≈  0.499    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {18/38\cdot 20/38}}\approx 0.499}   .  The variance     v    {\displaystyle v}   is defined as the square of the VI. Therefore, the variance of the even-money American Roulette bet is ca. 0.249, which is extremely low for a casino game. The variance for Blackjack is ca. 1.2, which is still low compared to the variances of electronic gaming machines (EGMs).  Additionally, the term of the volatility index based on some confidence intervals are used. Usually, it is based on the 90% confidence interval. The volatility index for the 90% confidence interval is ca. 1.645 times as the "usual" volatility index that relates to the ca. 68.27% confidence interval.  It is important for a casino to know both the house edge and volatility index for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the volatility index tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called gaming mathematicians and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so they outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field.

Probability is a branch of mathematics, and a lot of people have trouble with math. But calculating the odds that something will or won’t happen is a lot easier than you think.  Here are the 14 examples and how they relate to probability.   1. How to calculate the probability of an event   The first concept to understand is that probability is something that applies to random events. It’s a way of measuring mathematically how likely it is that you’ll see a certain event happen or not happen.  And the first thing to know is that a probability is always a number between 0 and 1. I’ll go into that a little bit more in the next bullet point, but for now, you need to understand that an event that will never occur has a probability of 0. An event that will always occur has a probability of 1.     Anything that might or might not happen can be measured with a number between 0 and 1. And that number is easily calculated.   You take the number of ways an event can happen and divide it by the total number of events possible.  Here’s an easy example:  You flip a coin. There are 2 possible outcomes, both of which are equally likely. You want to know the probability of the coin landing on heads. There’s only one way for it to land on heads, so the probability is ½. That can also be expressed as 0.5, 50%, or 1 to 1.  More about that in the next bullet point.   2. Probabilities expressed as fractions, decimals, percentages, and odds   All probabilities are, by their nature, fractions. But there are multiple ways of expressing a fraction. I gave examples in #1 related to the toss of a coin.  Let’s look at a different example. Let’s say that you have a 2-headed coin.  What is the probability that the coin will land on heads?  And what is the probability that it will land on tails?  Since there are 2 heads, you have a 100% chance of getting a result of heads, and a 0% chance of getting a result of tails.  You can also express that as 1/1 (which is just 1). Or you could express it as 1.0. But most people are comfortable expressing it as a percentage.  In Dungeons & Dragons , you use different shaped dice with more or fewer sides than just six. Let’s use a 4-sided die for this example.   What are the odds of rolling a 4 on a 4-sided die that’s numbered 1-4?   There’s only 1 way to get that result, but there are 4 possible results.  Expressed as a fraction, that’s ¼. Expressed as a decimal, it’s 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, it’s 25%. And expressed as odds, it’s 3 to 1. (Odds are expressed by the number of ways it can’t happen versus the number of ways it can.)   3. The probability of a coin toss   Let’s go back to the coin toss example. I’m going to use it as an example for how to calculate the probability of multiple events.  Suppose you want to know the probability of getting heads twice in a row. When you’re calculating the probability of one event happening AND another event happening, you multiply the two probabilities together.  In this case, we have a 0.5 probability of getting heads. 0.5 X 0.5 = 0.25, which is the probability of getting heads twice in a row.  If you look at the total number of possibilities, it’s easy to see why this is the case:   You could get tails twice.  You could get heads twice.  You could get tails on the first toss and heads on the second toss.  You could get heads on the first toss and tails on the second toss.   Those are the 4 options, and only one of them is the desired result.   4. Probability and the rolling of six-sided dice   Let’s look at another probability example using a traditional six-sided die. The die has 6 possible results, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  The probability of any specific one of those numbers coming up is 1/6.  But what if you want to calculate the probability of getting a 1 OR a 2?  When you’re calculating probabilities that use “AND” in the problem, you multiply.  But if you’re using “OR”, you add.  The probability of getting a 1 is 1/6. The probability of getting a 2 is also 1/6.  1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6, which can be reduced to 1/3.  You can also express that as 33.33% or 0.33 or as 2 to 1 odds.   5. Probability in card games   All kinds of probabilities come into play in card games, but they’re all based on a handful of qualities that a deck of cards has.  A standard deck of cards consists of 52 cards. The probability of getting any specific card is 1/52.  The cards are divided into 4 different suits—clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. If you want to know the probability of getting a card of a specific suit, it’s ¼.  The cards are also divided into 13 different ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace.  The probability of getting a card of a specific rank is 1/13.  But one of the interesting things about card games is that the dealing of cards changes the probability of getting subsequent cards.     Here’s an example:   You’re playing blackjack with a single deck, and you’ve been dealt an ace as your first card. What is the probability that the next card will also be an ace?    There are only 3 aces left in the deck. And the deck only has 51 cards left, too.  So the probability is 3/51, or 1/17, or 16 to 1.  Here’s another example:  You’re playing 5 card stud. You have 3 aces and a deuce. You only have one opponent, and he has 4 cards, none of which is an ace.  There is only one ace left in the deck. And there are 44 cards left in the deck.  So the probability of getting the last ace on your next card is 1/44, or 43 to 1.   6. Probability on a roulette wheel   An American roulette wheel has 38 pockets in which the ball can land. The probability of the ball landing in a specific pocket is 1/38. This can also be expressed as 37 to 1.  This is a great example, because it demonstrates how the casino gets its edge over the player. This bet pays off at 35 to 1.  Since the odds of winning are 37 to 1 and the payoff is only 35 to 1, over a long enough period of time, the casino will almost surely win a lot of money on this bet.  And every bet on the roulette wheel offers a payoff that isn’t commensurate with the odds of winning.  I’ll discuss the house edge more later, but let’s look at some of the other probabilities offered on a roulette wheel.  The pockets aren’t just numbered. They’re also colored. 2 of them are green, 18 of them are black, and 18 of them are red.  If you want to know the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket, it’s 2/38, or 1/19, or 18 to 1.  If you want to know the probability of the ball landing in a black pocket, it’s 18/38, or 9/19, or 37 to 18.  The probability of the ball landing in the red pocket is the same.  You can also place bets on whether the ball lands on an odd or even number. The 0 and the 00 (the green pockets) qualify as neither. So the odds of winning odd or even are the same as winning a bet on black or red.  Those are just some examples. There are a dizzying number of roulette bets you can place.   7. How the house edge works in a casino game   The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to win over the long run. The easiest way to calculate this number is to assume that someone is playing for $100 a bet, and determining how much he’ll lose on average over the long run, then divide that into the number of bets.  I’ll use roulette as an example again, because it’s illustrative.  You place 38 bets on a single number at the roulette table. If you had a mathematically perfect set of spins (which is what you want to assume when you’re calculating the house edge), you’ll win once and lose 37 times.  The winning bet pays off at 35 to 1, so you’ll win $3500 on it. But you’ll lose $3700 on the 37 losing spins. Your net loss is $3700 – $3500, or $200.  If you divide $200 by 38, you get $5.26 per spin, which is your average loss per spin.  That is the house edge for the game—5.26%.     It’s important to remember that the house edge is a long term mathematical expectation. In the short term, anything can (and often will) happen.   But once you get into tens of thousands of results, you’ll start to see the actual results trending toward the expected results.  The casino relies on the law of large numbers for their business model. Players are hoping to have the occasional short-term run of luck. The casino knows that these short-term runs of luck are more than compensated for by the actual expected results on all the other bets being placed constantly throughout the casino.   8. Why betting systems don’t work   There’s a big difference between a betting system and a gambling strategy. A betting system is a method of increasing and reducing your bets based on your previous results. These betting systems don’t work because they rely on the gamblers fallacy.  The gamblers fallacy is the belief that previous events somehow affect the probability of future events. In the case of truly independent trials, previous results have no effect.     Here’s an example:   You’re playing roulette, and you’ve noticed that the ball has landed in a red pocket 8 times in a row. What is the probability that it will land in a red pocket on the next spin? Since there are still 38 pockets, and 18 of them are still red, the probability is the same—18/38.    This is not to be confused with the question of what the probability is that the ball will land on red 9 times in a row. That’s a different question. You’re not placing a bet on whether or not the ball is going to land on red 9 times in a row. You’re placing a bet on the next spin, which is an individual event.  A lot of gamblers have trouble with the concept of independent events.  So they create betting systems which assume that these previous results affect future results.  The classic example is the Martingale System .   9. Examples of the gamblers fallacy   The Martingale System is the classic example of a betting system based on the gamblers fallacy .  The idea is simple enough. You place a single bet on red or black at the roulette table. If you win, you pocket your winnings. If you lose, you double your bet on the next spin. If you win that time, you’ve profited a single unit.  If you lose again, you double your bet again.  This is called a progressive betting system because your bets grow progressively larger.  But in the long run, it doesn’t work.  One of two things will happen if you use this system long enough:   You’ll run into a losing streak long enough that you won’t be able to afford the next bet in the progression.  You’ll run into a losing streak long enough that the casino won’t let you bet enough to cover your losses.      Here’s an example of the Martingale System in action:   You bet $5 on black. You lose. You then bet $10 on black. You lose again. You then bet $20 on black. You lose again. You then bet $40 on black. This time you win. You’ve lost $35 up to this point, so your net win is $5 (your original betting unit).    What most players seem to lose sight of is how easy it is to run into a streak—it happens more often than they think.  Here’s what the progression looks like:   $5  $10  $20  $40  $80  $160  $320  $640  $1280   Let’s assume you’re playing at a casino with a maximum bet of $500. This means that if you lose 7 times in a row, the casino won’t let you place a large enough bet to continue your system.  How often does this happen?  More often than most gamblers think.  The odds of getting the same color 7 times in a row are easily calculated.  The odds of getting a red result are 18/38, or 47.36%.  47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% X 47.36% = 0.534%.  That’s half a per cent, or about once every 200 times the progression is played.  In the short run, a gambler using the Martingale guarantees that he’ll never see anything but occasional small wins.  In the long run, a gambler using the Martingale will eventually run into a streak of bad luck which will wipe out all his winnings.   10. Probabilities in blackjack   Blackjack is one of my favorite examples of probability in action. That’s because, unlike roulette, the deck of cards has a memory. Every time a card is dealt in a game of blackjack, the composition of the deck changes. This means the odds change.  This is why card counters are able to get an edge. They have a means of tracking these changes in the composition of the deck.     Here’s a classic example:   You’re playing in a single deck blackjack game, and you’ve noticed that all 4 aces have already been dealt. What is the probability that you’ll get a blackjack? Since a blackjack is made up of an ace and a card valued at 10, and since there are no aces left in the deck, the probability of getting a blackjack is 0%.    But you can calculate the probability of getting a blackjack from a fresh deck of cards, too.  You’re calculating the probability that you’ll get an ace on the first or the 2 nd card. There are 4 aces in the deck, so your probability is 4/52. That becomes 1/13 when you reduce it. Since this is an “or” question, we add those together:  1/13 + 1/13 = 2/13  But now you get to the “and” part of the problem. You need an ace AND a 10. There are 16 cards in the deck worth 10: the king, the queen, the jack, and the 10.  Your odds of getting a 10 for your other card are 16/51.  16/51 X 2/13 = 32/663. That equates to 4.83% of the time, which is about 5%.  5% is the same thing as once every 20 hands, so you have an approximate idea of how often you’ll get a blackjack.   11. Probabilities in video poker and slot machines   One of the great things about video poker is that even though it looks like a slot machine, it’s NOT a slot machine.  Here’s why that’s great:  Slot machines are the only game in the casino that have opaque math behind them. In other words, you have no way of knowing what the odds and/or payouts are on a slots game.  Yes, slots have pay tables. So you know what the payoffs are for various combinations of symbols on the reels.  But you have no way of knowing what the probability of getting a particular symbol on a reel is.  If you DID know this, you could calculate the probability, the house edge, and the payback percentage.  Here’s an example:  You’re playing a game with lemons as one of the primary symbols. The probability of getting a lemon on each reel is 1/10. If you get 3 lemons, you win 900 coins.  The probability of getting 3 lemons is 1/10 X 1/10 X 1/10, or 1/1000. In odds terms, that’s 999 to 1.  (Remember, to calculate probability when the question includes the word “and”, you multiply. Here, you want to know the probability of getting a lemon on line 1 AND on line 2 AND on line 3.)  Let’s assume this is a high roller game and that you’re betting $100 per spin.  You make 1000 spins. On 999 of those spins, you lose $100, for a total loss of $99,900. On 1 of those spins, you win 900 coins, or $90,000. Your net loss is $99,900 – $90,000, or $9900.  Average that out over 1000 spins, and you’ve lost an average of $9.90 per spin.  So the house edge on this game is 9.9%. The payback percentage is what casino people look at when dealing with gambling machines, though. That’s just 100% less the house edge—in this case, 90.1%. It represents the amount of each bet that the casino gives back to the player, rather than the amount it gets to keep. It’s also sometimes referred to as return to player.  The casinos and slot machine designers know these odds. They designed the game. But since the games are powered by a random number generator, they’re the only people who know these odds. If the game were mechanical, you’d be able to calculate the odds just by knowing the number of symbols on each reel, because each symbol would have an equal probability of turning up.  But a lemon might be programmed to come up once every 12 spins, or once every 15 spins, or once every 20 spins. There’s just no way to know.  Video poker, on the other hand, duplicates the probabilities you’d find in a deck of cards. Not only do you know what each combination of cards pays off at. You also know the probability of getting each combination.  You can use that information to calculate the house edge and the payback percentage for the game.     Here’s an example:   We know that in a standard Jacks or Better game with a 9/6 pay table that a pair of jacks or higher pays off at even money. You’ll see that hand about 21.5% of the time. So the expected value (the payback percentage) for that particular hand is 1 X 21.5%.    You can do that same calculation for every possible hand. You multiply the amount you stand to win by the probability of getting the hand. Then you add up all the possibilities to get the overall payback percentage for the game.  And the great thing about video poker is that the payback percentages are almost always higher than for slot machines.  The other great thing about video poker is that you have a certain amount of intellectual stimulation that isn’t present during a slot machine. You have to decide how you play each hand. Playing them correctly increases your chances of winning.   12. How to calculate expected return   The expected return of a bet is how much you expect that bet to be worth. If it’s worth more than you’re risking, then it’s a positive expectation bet. Otherwise, it’s a negative expectation bet. Gamblers sometimes use +EV or -EV as a shorthand for this.  Here’s how you calculate what a bet is worth:  You take the probability of losing and multiply it by the amount you’ll lose. Then you take the probability of winning and multiply it by the amount you’ll win. You subtract one from the other, and you have your expected return.  It’s that simple.  Let’s use roulette as an example (again).  You place a $100 bet on a single number. If you win, you get $3500. If you lose, you lose $100.   Sounds like a pretty good deal at first glance, doesn’t it?   But let’s do the math.  There are 38 numbers on the roulette wheel, so the probability of winning your bet is 1/38. The probability of losing your bet is 37/38.  1/38 X $3500 = $92.11  37/38 X -$100 = -$97.37  The difference is $5.26. And since the negative number is greater, that’s the amount you expect to lose. The expected value of that bet is -$5.26.  You can use this kind of calculation in life, too. I’ll talk about that more later.   13. How to invent a casino game   The trick to inventing a casino game is to come up with something that looks like a fair bet but isn’t. If you’re too obvious about putting the odds in favor of the casino, no one will want to play.  Let’s use a bet on a coin toss as an example.  Suppose you run a casino, and you offer to pay 25 cents to anyone who correctly guesses the correct result on a coin toss. Here’s how you get your edge—you make the player put up 50 cents in order to win that quarter.  The casino has an obvious large edge in that situation, even if you don’t know how to do the math. But we do know how to do the math, so let’s look at it:  You have a 50% chance of winning 25 cents.  You also have a 50% chance of losing 50 cents.  50% of 25 cents = 12.5 cents  50% of -50 cents = -25 cents  Your expected value is -12.5 cents. Your expected loss on every bet is 12.5 cents. Since you’re betting 50 cents on every bet, the house has an edge of 25%.  That’s huge.  But let’s see if we can make the game a little more interesting.  Let’s say you have to bet a dollar, minimum.  This time, you toss a coin and so does the casino. If one of you gets heads and the other one gets tails, the party with heads is the winner. The party with tails is the loser.  And let’s say this game offers an even money payout.  Looks like a break even game, doesn’t it?  It is, but what do we do in the event of a tie?  What if you both get heads?  What if you both get tails?  If you want to give the casino an edge, you just add a rule that if you both get heads, the game is a push. Your bet is returned, but you don’t win anything.  But if you both get tails, the casino still wins.   What kind of house edge would this game have?   Let’s look at the probabilities involved:  You have the following potential outcomes, all of which are equally likely:   You both get heads.  You both get tails.  You get heads, and the house gets tails.  The house gets heads, and you get tails.   So you have a 25% chance of a push, which has a net effect of 0. (You don’t win anything, but you don’t lose anything, either.)  You have a 25% chance of winning a dollar, which is an expected value of 25 cents.  You have a 25% chance of losing a dollar, which is an expected value of -25 cents.  And you have a 25% chance of losing a dollar, which is an expected value of -25 cents.  The house still has a 25% edge, but it isn’t nearly as obvious now, is it?  The house could make the game even more fair by returning half your bet in the case of both of you getting tails. That would reduce the house edge to 12.5%, which is better but not great.  Another option would be to take any tie result and have 2 options:   You could put up another dollar in order to get another coin toss.  You could just surrender your bet.   The catch is if you put up the other dollar and win, you only get $1 in winnings. But if the casino wins, you lose both dollars.  And in fact, this is almost exactly how casino war works.  That’s just a simplified version of how to create a new casino game. You could have multiple bets, multiple payouts, and multiple probabilities for each outcome. You just have to look at the expected value of all of them to determine how much of an edge the house.  Then you have to test the game in front of a live gambling audience to see how they respond. If the gamblers don’t like the game and refuse to play, you don’t have a potential casino game at all.     The house wins nothing if no one likes the game.    14. Using probability in real life   This is the most important section of the post, actually. You can use your knowledge of probability to make decisions in real life that are better than the decisions of most people.     Here’s an example:   You work at a job making $50,000 a year. You decide to take a job making $200,000 a year, even though you estimate that there’s a 25% chance of the company paying you $200,000 a year going bankrupt after your first year of employment. The expected value of that decision is simple enough.    But let’s look at a more day-to-day practical application. Suppose you’re considering parking in a handicapped spot.  The probability of getting a ticket for this might be 20%, and the parking ticket might be $200. That’s an expected loss of $40.  But parking in that spot will save you half an hour of walking, and you’re a highly paid consultant earning $250 per hour. That means your time is worth $125 per half hour.  Since your time is worth well over $40, it makes financial sense to take the risk.  Of course, that example ignores any moral implications involved. You might have a moral problem with taking up a parking spot intended for a handicapped person.  Here’s another practical example:  You’re obese, and you’re 45 years old. According to the doctor, your life expectancy if you don’t lose weight is 60 years old. But if you have weight loss surgery, your life expectancy becomes 68 years old.  But you also have a 1 in 800 chance of dying during the weight loss surgery.   What’s the correct decision, mathematically?   Let’s assume that the life expectancy numbers are absolute certainties, because that makes the math easier to do.  You have a 100% chance of dying 15 years earlier if you don’t use the surgery. That’s -15 years.  You have a 799/800 chance of gaining 18 years if you have the surgery. That’s an expected gain of +17.98 years.  You also have a 1/800 chance of dying 30 years earlier (at age 45). That’s another -0.04 years in expected loss.  17.98 – 15 – 0.04 = 2.94 years of expected additional life.  And chances are, you’ll enjoy life more during that time. You’ll be able to engage in more activities, find more people to date, and require less medical attention.  The net positive outweighs the negative, even though the calculations seems pretty close.  You can make the math even more complicated by factoring in the possibility that you could lose the weight without surgery. But we don’t need to get into that much detail; we just wanted to look at how this type of thinking (probability based) can be applied to real life issues to make better decisions.)   Conclusion   You can find an almost unlimited number of gambling probability examples to discuss. But all of them start with the notion that probability is always a number between 0 and 1. The other thing to remember in probability problems is the difference between “or” and “and”. If you want to know the probability of this happening OR that happening, you add the probabilities of each together. If you want to know the probability of this happening AND that happening, you multiply the probabilities by each other.  You can multiply the probability of winning by the amount you win and compare it with the probability of losing and the amount you’ll lose to get the expected value of any bet. In casino games, the edge is always with the house, although the way they present the games is subtle.     It’s not always clearly obvious how the casino gets it mathematical edge over the player. But it’s always there, unless you’re a card counter or expert video poker player.

But those other forms are also slanted toward the people running the games. Casinos have something called the vig (short for vigorish), the advantage the house enjoys on all so-called "even money" and "true odds" bets, on which you're paid, respectively, what you've bet on or an amount proportional to your risk. In horse racing, you bet against everyone else at the track, and, typically, the house takes 17 percent of all money bet.  With breakage (the house rounds every payoff down to the nearest dime), add another two percent.  That's 19 percent you have to overcome before breaking even.    These numbers are the percentages of defeat built into every casino game, sports game, or horse race you bet.  They are the odds stacked against players.  If you're betting $100 an hour on roulette, you will, in the long run, lose an average of $5.26 an hour. Craps is extremely complicated-- but much of its fascination lies in its complexity.  In the game, one player-- the shooter-- throws a pair of dice and bets, along with other players at the table, on specific numbers turning up. On the shooter's first roll, the wager-- called a pass line bet-- is on whether he'll throw either 7 or 11 (a win) or 2, 3, or 12 (a loss).  If he hits 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes his point; your original wager is then on whether he'll roll that number again before he throws a 7. After making a pass line bet, when a point has been established, you can make an odds bet.  You do this by placing another bet-- equal to one, two...up to ten times the original bet-- on the point number.  The casino will pay true odds on this second bet, based n the probability of the point number coming up. These true odds bets reduce the house's edge in craps to less that 1 percent.  Next to blackjack played with extreme discipline, this is the best bet you'll have in casino. The odds on slot machines are terrible.  Casinos make two thirds of their profits from slots.  But smart gamblers avoid slots as surely as they do Lotto machines. Roulette, in which you're betting on whether a ball spinning above a wheel will land on a certain number, group of numbers, or color, has a simplicity that makes it a perfect game for anyone wishing to meet destiny face-to-face. In addition to the numbers 1 through 36, the roulette wheel has the numbers 0 and 00, which gives the house a 5.26 percent advantage on all bets-- a significant edge. Most people believe that Blackjack, the casino version of the card game 21, is the easiest and best game to play in a casino.  Depending on how you play, this can be true. The object of the game is to take card that bring you close to a total of 21 without going over.  Face cards count as 10.  Aces count as either 11 or 1. Each player at a blackjack table plays only against the dealer-- not other players.  If a player takes too many cards and goes over 21, he or she loses.  If the dealer takes too many cards, the players all win.  Otherwise, if your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win. You bet your money before you see any cards.  In some situations, you can raise your bet after seeing your first two cards.  When you win, you are paid 2 to 1.  If you get a Blackjack-- an ace and any card worth ten-- you win a slightly higher multiple of your bet. The most popular way to play Blackjack is the so-called "perfect strategy."  Based on the law of large numbers, which states that averages and tendencies gain strength over time , the perfect strategy was derived by computers simulating millions of twenty-one hands.  It results in some counter-intuitive rules.  Two examples:  You have sixteen, the dealer is showing a ten.  The chart says hit.  You'll lose 75% of the time.  If you don't hit, you'll lose 77% of the time.  Twice in one hundred-- in a game in which the dealer shouldn't beat you more than 51 hands per hundred-- is a huge margin.  You have a pair of aces or 8's, and the dealer is showing a ten.  The chart says split-- despite the impulse to keep one bad hand rather than making two. Played correctly, this system assures you of being at no more than a 2 percent disadvantage against the casino.  In practice, the house wins at a rate ten times higher-- because few players follow the perfect strategy...perfectly. For example, the perfect strategy demands that you always split second pairs and "double down" (double your original wager by placing a second bet next to your original on the table) when you're supposed to.  Most players prefer to follow their instincts. Some players prefer to count cards as they are played at the Black jack table, adjusting their bets according to how many tens and aces are left to be played in a given hand. In the more complicated card-counting system:  7's and 8's are considered neutral and aren't counted;  2 through 6 are counted as negative 1;  9's, 10's, and Aces are counted as 1.  A simpler version counts 9's and 10's in one column, aces in another, and hands played on your fingers.  A high (or minus) deck-- with a good half of the deck dealt and a large number of aces still unplayed-- favors the player.  When the count is high, you should increase your bets.
