Nearly 13,000 people in the US were murdered with firearms in 2015. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC. But research is bootstrapped because of federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. AR-15 rifle that he purchased legally It was the deadliest school shooting in Florida history. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had reportedly been known as a threat to the school, and teachers have bemoaned how they were powerless to stop him. Cruz's victims join a growing number of people in the US intentionally killed at the end of a gun. Below is how the lifetime odds of dying from gun violence (highlighted in red; suicides and accidents excluded) stack up against many causes of death for Americans: Skye Gould/Business Insider Assaults by firearm kill about 13,000 people in the US each year, which translates to a roughly 1-in-315 lifetime chance of death from gun violence. That's about 56% more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a car, truck, or van. It's also more than 11 times as high as dying from any force of nature, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, or lightning strike. These measures also suggest Americans are more likely to die from gun violence than the combined risks of drowning, fire and smoke, stabbing, choking on food, airplane crashes, animal attacks, and natural disasters. Where the data comes from Parents wait for news after a report of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Associated Press/Joel Auerbach The chart above does not account for a person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that could shift the results; it's an average of the entire US population. But it clearly shows that gun violence in the US is a leading cause of death, which is how the CDC describes firearm homicides in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Most of the data comes from an October 2017 report by the National Safety Council and a November 2017 report by the National Center for Health Statistics on causes of death in the US, primarily those that occurred in 2015. (The NSC report uses 2014 data wherever newer data was unavailable.) Mass shootings aren't part of the data sets above, but the Gun Violence Archive project keeps a sourced tally , which we've independently counted. The organization considers any event where four or more victims were injured (regardless of death) to be a mass shooting. In 2015, some 333 mass shootings left 367 people dead and 1,328 injured. The statistics rose in 2016 to 383 mass shootings, 456 deaths, and 1,537 injuries. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings that led to 437 deaths and 1,802 injuries. Foreign-born terrorism data comes from Cato Institute terrorism data , and some natural-disaster data comes from Tulane University . We calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2015 life expectancy and population numbers in the US, and our analysis assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (Mortality data from previous years suggests these rankings are relatively consistent, with the exception of skyrocketing accidental poisonings due to the opioid epidemic. ) You can view our full dataset and sourcing here . A dearth of US gun-violence research Although gun violence is one of the leading causes of death in America, it is also one of the most poorly researched, according to a January 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least-funded cause of death after falls," the study's authors wrote. The study ascribed this dearth of research to restrictions — namely a 21-year-old congressional appropriations bill called the Dickey Amendment that stipulated "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Research into gun violence is the most poorly funded relative to other causes of death. Dr. David E. Stark, Dr. Nigam H. Shah/JAMA This and other federal funding restrictions are still active, hindering many scientists from understanding the problem. "The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done," Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, told Mother Jones in a January 2017 story . "It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources." But what questions have been researched by private institutions like the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a clear connection between gun ownership, gun availability, homicides, and violent death. A roundup of gun-control and gun-violence studies by German Lopez at Vox shows Americans represent less than 5% of the world population but possess nearly 50% of the world's civilian-owned guns, police are about three times more likely to be killed in states with high gun ownership, countries with more guns see more gun deaths , and states with tighter gun control laws see fewer gun-related deaths . This story was updated with the latest final data from CDC, which covers the year 2015. We previously stated that about 11,000 people in the US are killed during firearm assaults; that was a 2014 statistic. In 2015, nearly 13,000 people in the US were killed during firearm assaults.

Shutterstock A gunman in Las Vegas killed dozens and injured hundreds at a country music festival on Sunday. Some 11,000 people in the US are killed in firearm assaults each year. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in America, but research on the problem is bootstrapped due to federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. A gunman fired on a Las Vegas country music festival on Sunday evening, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 525 people. Police identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock , a 64-year-old man from Nevada. Members of the SWAT team who raided Paddock's room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino said they believe he took his own life. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's sheriff also said officers found 23 guns in his room, including what appeared to be at least one modified automatic weapon . Nineteen additional guns were later found in his home, police said. The motive is not yet known for the attack, though the FBI on Monday contradicted ISIS's claim that it was responsible for the massacre, saying Paddock appeared to have "no connection with an international terrorist group." Whatever spurred the event, it is now the deadliest mass shooting in US history — and Paddock's victims join a growing number of people in the US that were intentionally killed at the end of a gun.

Written by Shawn Radcliffe on June 24, 2016 When faced with an armed attacker or a wild animal, fear can be a good thing.  Fear prompts an alert to immediate danger and primes the body to respond in a way that provides protection from that danger.  But as creative creatures, humans also have the ability to anticipate future threats.  These feelings may be triggered by the memory of a traumatic event or something in the environment, like a dark alley or the way someone is dressed.   Sometimes, though, alertness can grow out of control, morphing into anxiety or fear that outpaces the actual risk of danger.  In the past, people may have feared tornadoes whenever the sky darkened, or animal attacks while walking alone in the forest.  These days, fears are just as likely to be related to recent events like the attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando , or the San Bernardino shooting.  “Terrorism and mass shootings have, for now, become part of a ‘national anxiety,’” Daniel Antonius, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, wrote in an email to Healthline.  Read More: More experts approaching gun violence as a public health issue »  Fear out of sync  By itself, fear is not a bad thing.  But when it is out of sync with the actual risks, fear can negatively shape decisions and behaviors.  Taken to the extreme, fear can even cause shutting off from the world.  This is not to say that the world may not be dangerous.  But the dangers may not be what they really seem.  “People are far more likely to be the victim of a property crime or a very traditional street crime than they are to be the victim of an incident of mass violence or terrorism,” Joseph Schafer, Ph.D., a professor of criminal justice at Southern Illinois University, told Healthline.  So how likely is it to die by a mass shooting or terrorist attack?  According to research by The Washington Post , 869 people have been killed in mass shootings in the United States since August 1, 1966.  This includes shootings in which four or more people were killed by one or two shooters. It excludes shootings related to gang violence, as well as those that started as other crimes or involved only the shooter’s family.   Those shootings are a small fraction of the overall number of gun-related deaths. In 2015, of the 25,000 gun-related injuries in the United Stated, 12,000 resulted in death.  Of those, 39 were from mass shootings.  The National Safety Council puts the lifetime risk of being killed in the United States by any assault with a firearm at 1 in 358.  The lifetime risk of dying in a mass shooting is around 1 in 110,154 — about the same chance of dying from a dog attack or legal execution.  There is a three times greater chance of dying from a sharp object than from a mass shooting. The chance of dying from lightning, though, is lower.  In fact, there are many more likely ways to die than in a mass shooting.  Heart disease and cancer are at the top — the risk of dying is 1 in 7. And even dying in a motor vehicle crash is higher — 1 in 113.  And what about terrorist attacks?  Another report by The Washington Post found that in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, the risk of dying in a terrorist incident is less than the risk of being killed by falling furniture or a TV.  Read More: Why gun violence is a public health issue »  Fear lingers after trauma  Even though the risk of dying in a mass shooting or a terrorist attack is low, real fears are rooted in actual events.  “There is a spike in general psychiatric symptoms and disorders after a terror attack, and there is a spike in general fears of future attacks,” said Antonius. “The psychiatric symptoms disappear relatively quickly — within months — but the underlying fear can linger for years after the attack.”  The severity of fear is partly related to where someone was during an attack.  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, people living in New York City experienced greater levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those in other areas of the country.  But the extensive media coverage that follows traumatic events means that even people not directly connected to the event may develop fear or anxiety in response.   “The amount of TV coverage of the attacks being watched is associated with elevated rates of post-traumatic stress disorder,” said Antonius.  One group of researchers found that, following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, people who were exposed to repeated media coverage of the attack, but were not directly involved, reported high levels of stress.  The researchers suggest that seeing or hearing news related to an attack several hours a day might prolong the stress reaction triggered by the initial “collective trauma.”  It’s difficult to know the exact link between media coverage of an attack and people’s fears, but the content that people watch may matter.  “We do tend to see that people who have greater exposure to different types of news media, as well as people who view more crime dramas, tend to express higher levels of fear,” said Schafer, “but it’s not clear which is causing the other.”  People may develop anxiety from watching the news, or people who are anxious may watch the news in order to calm their worries.  News media can also skew the perception of how frequent these events are.  Compare the coverage of a mass shooting to the number of reports about people dying from other causes.  Read More: PTSD can last for years in people who witness traumatic events »  Estimating risks is difficult  Even without the influence of the media, we are not always very good at knowing what is most dangerous in our environment.  “People are not good at estimating actual risk, especially ‘emotionally charged’ risks,” said Antonius.  This is as true for traditional crime as it is for mass shootings.  “We tend to see, across the board, that people’s actual risk of victimization and their fear of crime tend to be disconnected from one another,” said Schafer, “but it’s not in a consistent way.”  Age plays an important role in how people determine — or fail to determine — what is most dangerous.   Young people tend to underestimate risks, even though they are more likely to be victims of crime and violent crime. Middle-aged and older adults, on the other hand, have a moderate amount of fear even though their risk of being a victim is quite low.  In addition to watching the news, our brains can shape how we react to traumatic events.  Dreading an event, like a mass shooting, may feed our fears. But some research has also shown that when people have more control over a situation, they tend to view risks more optimistically.  For example, dying in a motor vehicle accident is more likely than being killed in a plane crash, but flying means giving up control of safety to the pilot, which can feed fears.  Emotions can shape perceptions of risk and also responses to threats.  “In the context of anger, people tend to exhibit greater levels of optimism and sense of control — and preference for confrontation,” said Antonius, “whereas with fear comes greater pessimism and negativity — and preference for using conciliatory measures to de-escalate conflict.”  While for some people the stress and anxiety that follows a mass shooting or terrorist attack can interfere with their daily lives. But for many more their innate survival mechanisms kick in when they need them.  “Most people respond to threats of future terrorism — terrorism fears — in a rational and constructive manner,” said Antonius. “We have, as humans, this innate resilience that helps us move on.”  READ THIS NEXT Essential Gifts for People Who Are Always on the Go What's the perfect gift for someone who's constantly moving and traveling?

Maybe it’s just that I’m congenitally not a worrier, but in my daily life I’m not in the least worried about being the victim of a terrorist attack or a mass shooting, by ISIS, right-wing extremists, or anyone else. Mass shootings and attacks are horrendous, and I can’t imagine how horrible it must be for the people who survive them and the loved ones of those who don’t, but anyone’s actual chances of being involved in one are extremely slight.  According to shootingtracker.com , there have been at least 462 people killed and 1312 injured in 353 mass shootings this year, which is already more than the 383 people killed last year. They define a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are killed or injured, which is a broader definition than the government has used. (Compare that to the 30K or so people killed in auto accidents each year.) According to the Census Bureau, the U.S. currently has a resident population of 322,367,564, giving me a 0.00000143% chance of getting killed in a mass shooting this year by the broadest definition. That’s almost literally a one in a million chance, the phrase we use when something is so unlikely that we won’t bother to worry about it.  Of those 353 shootings, 2 seemed to be related to Islamist terrorism (Chattanooga and San Bernardino), resulting in 19 deaths and 19 injuries. That’s from a site called thereligionofpeace.com, which is trying to prove how murderous Muslims are. By being so diligent in tracking deaths by Muslims, they ultimately show that Muslim terrorists have been responsible for .006% of the attacks and .041% of deaths in mass shootings this year, making my chances of being killed this year by a such a terrorist infinitesimal. So thanks, anti-Muslim website, for reassuring me.  But since deciding what counts as a mass shooting is difficult , let’s look at the most conservative data . Mother Jones magazine has been tracking mass shootings since 1982, and they use the criteria of four or more people killed, which means they don’t consider the recent Planned Parenthood attack a mass shooting, since “only” three people were killed. According to Mother Jones, there have been four mass shootings in the U.S. this year. According to shootingtracker.com data, there were 41 such shootings so far this year. However, they include domestic shootings such as this one and this one , which, while perhaps indicative of a culture of guns and violence, are in a different category than mass shootings in public places with the intent to kill randomly. One more kink. In 2013 Congress lowered the federal number of deaths required: “the term ‘mass killings’ means 3 or more killings in a single incident.” That would allow us to add the Planned Parenthood attack to the four mass shootings tracked by Mother Jones.  So at a conservative estimate there have been 5 mass shootings in the U.S. this year: San Bernadino (14 dead), Oregon (10 dead), Charleston (9 dead), Chattanooga (5 dead), and Colorado (3 dead). Of the 5 shootings, 2 are related to Islamist terrorism, 2 to what I would consider right-wing extremist terrorism (Colorado and Charleston), and 1 (Oregon) to who knows what craziness. By this reckoning, this year, there was a 40% chance of a mass shooting being related to Islamist terrorism, and 46% of the people killed in mass shootings were killed by Islamist terrorists, but still more people were killed by non-Muslim white American men than were killed by Muslims.  That’s a large percentage, but of a tiny number of events, and by these standards my odds increase significantly and I have a 0.00000013% chance of being killed in a mass shooting, and a 5.89389322e-8% chance of being killed by a Muslim terrorist. So despite all the fearmongering, there have been 2 Islamist terrorism incidents in the U.S. this year, giving us individually an insignificant chance of having been killed in one.  [Update] If we expand this analysis over several years, it looks even better. According to thereligionofpeace website, there have been 89 people killed by Muslim terrorists in the U.S. in the last 14 years. (I’m leaving out 9/11 because that is WAY outside the norm.) That averages to be about 6.4 people killed per year. Dividing that average by an average population of 320 million people each year gives a likelihood of death by Muslim terrorist of 2e-8%. That’s even lower than my previous estimate, because the San Bernadino shooting was uncharacteristic, and the largest number of dead since 2009. That’s a 1 in 50,000,000 or so chance each year that I’ll die in a terrorist attack in the U.S.  Just as who you associate with might lead to a domestic shooting, where you work might as well. I work at a university, where bomb threats seem to be increasing. None have actually been bombed because while any dipshit can buy a gun and start shooting people, making bombs is hard, and none of the shootings seemed related to Islamic terrorism. According to this Wikipedia list of attacks related to post-secondary schools, there have been 6 such attacks this year, leaving 17 people dead (including the 10 dead at Umpqua Community College in Oregon). There are 4,140 public or private colleges in the U.S., enrolling almost 18,000,000 students and having tens of thousands of employees. Again, an infinitesimal chance even within the domain of higher education.  None of this is an argument against fighting terrorism and mass shootings or trying to stop gun violence. However, it is an argument that an abnormal fear of being killed in a terrorist attack or mass shooting in the U.S. is unwarranted, and that the fearmongering is little short of demagoguery. Yes, they could happen anywhere, but they’re extremely unlikely to happen here , wherever here is. If the goal of terrorists is to terrorize me, they haven’t won.

To be fair, you’d probably need to take a period of say 20 years, come up with a single year average either for within the United States or all U.S. citizens killed globally, maybe include a function that factors in a marginal increase projecting into the future and then figure out compound lifetime risk. Your point is sound, but the single year methodology is inherently problematic as evidence.”  And my response: “I agree completely. This was a passing thought that I decided to spend a few minutes on doing the most basic of calculations. However, I suspect I’d find pretty much the same thing if I analyzed many years of data. There just aren’t that many terrorist attacks in the U.S. in any given year, and if we use the conservative estimation for mass shootings, there aren’t many of those, either. Despite the fear mongering, the fact is that relatively few people in the U.S. have been killed by terrorists since 9/11. The yearly death rate is very small.”           Wayne Bivens-Tatum on December 8, 2015 at 3:59 pm  said:    Okay, a bit more.

One major mass shooting every two months  Mass shootings in America - defined by the website Gun Violence Archive as an event where at least four people are shot - are now an everyday event.  Some 346 people were estimated to have been killed in American mass shootings in 2017. This compared to 432 in 2016, and 369 in 2015 - more than one person for every day of the year.

Misleading stats make finding a solution to the problem of gun violence that much harder, says David Mastio, deputy editorial page editor.

(Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 45 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Correction & clarification: Because of an editing error, Jonesboro, Ark., was mislabeled. With the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., several days gone but hardly forgotten, the time seems right to examine closely some of the statistical hype that made frightening news alongside details of the horrific shooting. In print and on TV, Americans were bombarded with facts and figures suggesting that the problem of school shootings was out of control. We were informed, for example, that since 2013 there has been an average of one school shooting a week in the U.S., and 18 since the beginning of this year. While these statistics were not exactly lies or fake news, they involved stretching the definition of a school shooting well beyond the limits of most people’s imagination. More: No, there have not been 18 school shootings already this year More: We have a right to bear arms. But after the Florida shooting, it's time for conversation. Everytown for Gun Safety reported that there have been 290 school shootings since the catastrophic massacre in Newtown, Conn., more than five years ago. However, very few of these were anything akin to Sandy Hook or Parkland. Sure, they all involved a school of some type (including technical schools and colleges) as well as a firearm, but the outcomes were hardly similar. Nearly half of the 290 were completed or attempted suicides, accidental discharges of a gun, or shootings with not a single individual being injured. Of the remainder, the vast majority involved either one fatality or none at all. It is easy to believe that school shootings are the “new normal” as has been intimated, or that we are facing a crisis of epidemic proportions. When schools are placed on lockdown based on an active shooter alert (which many times is a false alarm), cable news channels immediately inform their viewers of the danger, and word is tweeted and retweeted to millions, most of whom have no direct connection to the event. And when gunshots ring out, we hear the sounds replayed from cellphone recordings and watch through satellite feed as terrified survivors flee the scene. It makes a lasting impression, to be sure. For all those who believe that schools are under siege like never before, it is instructive to take a statistical road trip back in time. Since 1990, there have been 22 shootings at elementary and secondary schools in which two or more people were killed, not counting those perpetrators who committed suicide. Whereas five of these incidents have occurred over the past five-plus years since 2013, claiming the lives of 27 victims (17 at Parkland), the latter half of the 1990s witnessed seven multiple-fatality shootings with a total of 33 killed (13 at Columbine ). In fact, the 1997-98 school year was so awful, with four multiple-fatality shooting sprees at the hands of armed students (in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, Ore.), that then-President Clinton formed a White House expert committee to advise him. Nearly a decade later, President Bush convened a White House Conference on School Safety in the wake of multiple-fatality incidents during his administration. More: Survivor: I will never be OK until we stop school shootings POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Of course, I don’t mean to minimize any of the one-per week on average school shootings, but they should not be conflated with the most deadly but rare events. Unfortunately, most readers and viewers don’t appreciate the distinction when statistics including non-fatal school shootings are cited whenever there is mass killing at a school. Notwithstanding the occasional multiple-fatality shooting that takes place at one of the 100,000 public  schools across America, the nation’s schools are safe. Over the past quarter-century, on average about 10 students are slain in school shootings annually. Compare the school fatality rate with the more than 100 school-age children accidentally killed each year riding their bikes  or walking to school. Congress might be too timid to pass gun legislation to protect children, but how about a national bicycle helmet law for minors? Half of the states do not require them. There is no NRA — National Riding Association — opposing that. I’m all for shielding our kids from harm. But let’s at least deal with the low hanging fruit while we debate and Congress does nothing about the role of guns in school shootings.

With their acts of witness and advocacy, the teenage protesters of Parkland, Florida, shook many voters out of their complacency about pervasive gun violence. Upwards of 30,000 people lose their lives to firearms in our nation each year, a level of carnage unparalleled anywhere in the developed world. And yet, last October — just days after the worst mass shooting in American history — only 52 percent of Americans told CNN’s pollsters that they supported “stricter gun laws.”    Four Best Friends From Parkland Explain Why March for Our Lives Matters          Today, that figure is 70 percent — the highest it’s been at any time since 1993. Recent polls from Quinnipiac University and Politico /Morning Consult have produced nearly identical results. In Florida, long a bastion of NRA support, the leftward turn in public opinion has been especially sharp.

Moderate Republicans (such as they are) are imploring their party to move left on the gun issue. Major gun sellers are cutting ties with the NRA and imposing their own restrictions on firearm sales. Even Donald Trump has called for strengthening America’s background check system.    By keeping the national spotlight on the mass murder at their high school — and calling on their peers across the country to walk out of their schools, so as to “ no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings ” in the United States — the theater kids of Marjory Stoneman Douglas have built the broadest public consensus for gun-safety measures that America has seen in a quarter-century.    But they’ve also (inadvertently) triggered a moral panic about the safety of America’s schools that has little basis in empirical reality — and which is already lending momentum to policies that would increase juvenile incarceration , waste precious educational resources on security theater, and bring more guns into our nation’s classrooms.  On Tuesday in Tallahassee, Republicans in Florida’s state legislature advanced a law that aims to put one police officer — and ten gun-wielding teachers — into every public school in the state. The $67 million “school marshal” program would provide teachers who volunteer to be emergency gunslingers with a $500 stipend, a background check, drug test, psychological exam, and 132 hours of training. In total, the bill’s school safety measures come at a price tag of $400 million. One piece of that package — an increase in funding for mental health counselors — is laudable. The rest are either unnecessary or actively dangerous. The average salary for a teacher in Florida is nearly $10,000 less than the national mean; its public school system consistently ranks among the bottom half of U.S. states. This is not a place that can afford to misallocate hundreds of millions of dollars in educational funds.      The bill moving through Florida’s House of Representatives does pair that $400 million appropriation with a few gun reforms — a three-day waiting period for firearm purchases, an increase in the legal age for gun-buying from 18 to 21, and measures expanding the authority of police officers to confiscate guns from people who threaten to commit violence.  By themselves, those reforms are better than nothing. And the fact that Republican state legislators are pushing them forward — over the objections of the NRA — is a testament to the power of the Parkland protesters. But the impact of such modest regulations of the gun market, in a nation where firearms outnumber people, is likely to be marginal at best. And if the bill’s gun reforms cannot be separated from its “school marshal” program and expansion of classroom cops, then Florida’s young people might end up worse off than they’d be if their elected leaders had simply ignored the Parkland massacre, like so many mass shootings before it.  After the atrocity at Columbine High School in 1999, America tested the hypothesis that a massive increase in school policing would lead to lower rates of violence on campus — in 1997, 10 percent of public schools employed at least one police officer; by 2014, 30 percent did . The results of this experiment have been worse than disappointing. The best available research suggests that putting police officers in schools does not significantly deter crime — but does increase the number of students who end up incarcerated for minor youthful indiscretions (and/or, who get electrocuted with stun guns in their classrooms for the same).  Arming teachers, meanwhile, is a proposal so mind-bogglingly dumb and dangerous, even Florida’s GOP governor Rick Scott rejects it. There is no evidence whatsoever that adding a not-so-well regulated militia of amateur marksmen to every school faculty will prevent mass shootings, when armed guards have consistently failed to do so — but there is good reason to believe that such a program would radically worsen our nation’s preexisting crisis of racially discriminatory, teacher-on-student violence. As Patrick Blanchfield argues for the Intercept :      In 2017, researchers estimated that, in a given school year, 589 children are corporally punished (most often struck with paddles) every day . Unsurprisingly, this violent discipline is disproportionately inflicted on students of color . Black students are twice as likely as whites to be struck in Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In Maine, black children are eight times more likely to be hit than white children are. Children with disabilities also suffer a disproportionate share of this disciplinary violence. In a representative year, school authorities pinned down, tied up, or otherwise restrained 267,000 American schoolchildren , three-quarters of whom had some kind of disability; such practices have resulted in multiple fatalities . … America already has abundant and grim evidence about the outcomes of interactions between youth and armed authority figures. The lethality of our police has no real analog in the developed world: One-third of all Americans killed by strangers are killed by police. Here, too, the landscape of violence betrays stark disparities, particularly when it comes to children: Black teens are 21 times more likely to be shot dead than their white peers, and people with disabilities and mental illnesses are acutely vulnerable as well …Why would we expect different outcomes from arming teachers?  If the policy response to the Parkland shooting ends up hurting more American students than it helps, the lion’s share of responsibility will lie with the Republican Party. The Parkland survivors have been as emphatic in their rejection of arming teachers as they’ve been in their support for gun restrictions — and they’ve won the general public to their side of both issues.  But some of the hyperbolic rhetoric that progressives have embraced over the past two weeks has made it easier for the right to push regressive school safety policies. Such hyperbole pervades the mission statement for the post-Parkland protest movement, March for Our Lives:      Not one more. We cannot allow one more child to be shot at school. We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the lives of students. We cannot allow one more family to wait for a call or text that never comes. Our schools are unsafe. Our children and teachers are dying. We must make it our top priority to save these lives. March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar. … School safety is not a political issue. There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing … Every kid in this country now goes to school wondering if this day might be their last. We live in fear.  American children do not “risk their lives” when they show up to school each morning — or at least, not nearly as much as they do whenever they ride in a car, swim in a pool, or put food in their mouths (an American’s lifetime odds of dying in a mass shooting committed in any location is 1 in 11,125; of dying in a car accident is 1 and 491; of drowning is 1 in 1,133; and of choking on food is 1 in 3,461). Criminal victimization in American schools has collapsed in tandem with the overall crime rate, leaving U.S. classrooms safer today than at any time in recent memory.        Illustration: National Institute of Justice      And, perhaps most critically, there is no epidemic of mass shootings in American schools — at least, not under the conventional definitions of those terms.      In the immediate aftermath of the Parkland shooting, progressive activists and commentators (including this one) repeatedly claimed that there had been 18 school shootings since the start of this year. This proved to be a gross exaggeration . In reality, according to new research from Northeastern University , there have been a grand total of eight mass shootings (shootings that kill at least four people) at K-through-12 schools in the United States since 1996. Meanwhile, over the past 20 years, the number of fatal shootings in American schools (of any kind) has plummeted.              If mass school shootings were the only form of gun violence in the United States, the case for treating the regulation of firearms as a pressing policy issue would actually be fairly weak. For the past quarter-century, there has been an average of one mass murder (a killing of four or more people committed with any weapon, as opposed to just firearms) in an American school each year. Every one of those atrocities is a blight on humanity. But it is nearly impossible to design a policy that can bring the incidence of an already exceptionally rare crime down to zero — and given the inherently limited nature of legislative time and resources, it would make little sense to prioritize such a marginal and difficult issue over public health challenges that kill exponentially more people.    There is no “school safety” crisis in the U.S.; only a gun violence epidemic that consists primarily of suicides, accidents, and single-victim homicides committed with handguns. In the decades since Columbine, progressives have often led the public to believe otherwise. And for understandable reasons. Spectacular acts of mass murder committed against children (especially upper-middle class children in “good” public schools) attract a degree of media attention and political concern that our nation’s (roughly) 20,000 annual firearm suicides — and daily acts of urban gang violence — simply do not. The most misleading piece of the Parkland survivors’ message — that their experience is representative of a widespread social problem that threatens the lives of all American children — may well be its most politically effective component.    But if misrepresenting the nature of America’s gun problem has political benefits, it also has policy drawbacks. After all, if the March for Our Lives mission statement were actually true — if “every kid in this country” went “to school wondering if this day might be their last” — then there would be a reasonable case for filling American schools with law enforcement agents and increasing the use of juvenile detention.  And the right is already making that case: In recent days, conservative media outlets have suggested that the Parkland shooting could have been prevented if only Broward County hadn’t implemented the PROMISE program (Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Supports & Education) in 2013 — a policy that aimed to reduce juvenile arrests by promoting non-carceral approaches to correcting student misbehavior.  All of which is to say: The Parkland teenagers, and the movement they have launched, has made a vital contribution to American politics. They’ve stiffened the spines of Democratic gun safety advocates; unnerved Republican NRA stooges; improved the prospects of meaningful gun reform at the federal level in the medium-term; and provided a model of civic engagement to a rising generation whose political participation our country desperately needs.  But to ensure that those contributions aren’t shadowed by the unintended consequences of overheated rhetoric, the March for Our Lives and its supporters must take pains to ensure that their advocacy always affirms this basic truth: Schools don’t kill people, guns kill people.

In the United States, people who want to kill a lot of other people most often do it with guns.      Related      The number of U.S. mass shootings depends on how you count       Public mass shootings account for a tiny fraction of the country’s gun deaths, but they are uniquely terrifying because they occur without warning in the most mundane places. 
 
Most of the victims are chosen not for what they have done but simply for where they happen to be.      There is no universally accepted definition of a public mass shooting, and this piece defines it narrowly. It looks at the public shootings in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (two shooters in a few cases). It does not include shootings tied to gang disputes or robberies that went awry, and it does not include shootings that took place exclusively in private homes. A broader definition would yield much higher numbers.   Mass shootings are a small slice of total gun deaths   Source: Gun Violence Archive , Post research       This tally begins Aug. 1, 1966, when a student sniper fired down on passersby from the observation deck of a clock tower at the University of Texas. By the time police killed him, 17 other people were dead or dying. As Texas Monthly’s Pamela Colloff wrote , the shooting “ushered in the notion that any group of people, anywhere — even walking around a university campus on a summer day — could be killed at random by a stranger.”       Search for details of a particular shooting.

Two unborn children are included in the official death tolls from shootings in Austin and Sutherland Springs, Texas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              292 guns    Shooters often carried more than one weapon; one was found with 24. At least  of mass shooters’ weapons were obtained legally and were obtained illegally . It’s unclear how weapons were acquired.

Semiautomatic rifles  Semiautomatic rifles have been used in some of the country’s deadliest shootings, such as those in Newtown, Orlando, San Bernardino and Las Vegas. The AR-15, a lightweight, customizable version of the military’s M16, soared in popularity after a 10-year federal ban on assault weapons expired in 2004. Some of the Las Vegas shooter’s guns had been fitted with legal devices called “bump-fire stocks,” which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire as quickly as automatic ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Semiautomatic pistols  The country’s most popular type of firearm, 9mm semiautomatic handguns, are used by many law enforcement officers. They are generally light and inexpensive, easy to conceal and control, and they fire as quickly as a person can pull the trigger. The gunman who killed 
32 students and teachers at Virginia Tech in 2007 used a 9mm semiautomatic Glock 19 (and a .22-caliber Walther P22, another popular caliber). In this data, 9mm semiautomatic handguns show up more than any other weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         153 shooters    Some of these mass shooters were known to have violent tendencies or criminal pasts. Others seemed largely fine until they attacked. All but were male. The vast majority were between the ages of 20 and 49. More than half — of them — died at or near the scene of the shooting, often by killing themselves.

Women  The most recent female shooter was a Pakistani mother who helped kill 14 partygoers at her husband’s workplace in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015. The others are an ex-postal worker who killed a former neighbor and six employees at a Goleta, Calif., mail-processing facility in 2006; and a former tribal council chairwoman who killed her brother and three others during an eviction hearing in Alturas, Calif., in 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Middle-schoolers  Andrew Golden, 11, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, pulled a fire alarm to flush students and teachers out of their Jonesboro, Ark., middle school in 1998, and began shooting from a wooded perch nearby. They killed four girls and a teacher and wounded 10 others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       150 shootings   In the 50 years before the Texas tower shooting, there were just 25 public mass shootings in which four or more people were killed, according to author and criminologist Grant Duwe.

He killed 14 and wounded six before killing himself. It was the deadliest in a string of rage-fueled killings by current and former postal employees that gave rise to the phrase “going postal.”  “Active shooter”  The 1999 siege by two seniors at Columbine High School in Colorado became a turning point after which school shootings could no longer be considered unthinkable aberrations. After a confused response that played out over several hours while a wounded teacher bled to death, U.S. law enforcement agencies overhauled procedures and officer training to create protocols for stopping “active shooters.”       Additional contributions by Alex Horton , Lazaro Gamio, Kevin Uhrmacher , Richard Johnson and Ted Mellnik .    About this story  This data is compiled from Mother Jones; Grant Duwe, author of “Mass Murder in the United States: A History,” and Washington Post research. Death tolls include victims killed by shooters within a day of the main shooting, including any who were killed in another way. Totals also include people who later died from injuries received during the shootings. A gun purchase that should have been rejected but was allowed because of a bureaucratic or reporting glitch is considered illegal. Reports disagree on some ages in this dataset.

The odds may surprise you           Dave Mosher and Skye Gould     Feb. 15, 2018, 5:04 PM    40,840          facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link     Shutterstock A 19-year-old gunman allegedly killed 17 people at a Florida high school on Wednesday. Nearly 13,000 people in the US were murdered with firearms in 2015. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC. But research is bootstrapped because of federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. AR-15 rifle that he purchased legally It was the deadliest school shooting in Florida history. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had reportedly been known as a threat to the school, and teachers have bemoaned how they were powerless to stop him. Cruz's victims join a growing number of people in the US intentionally killed at the end of a gun. Below is how the lifetime odds of dying from gun violence (highlighted in red; suicides and accidents excluded) stack up against many causes of death for Americans: Skye Gould/Business Insider Assaults by firearm kill about 13,000 people in the US each year, which translates to a roughly 1-in-315 lifetime chance of death from gun violence. That's about 56% more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a car, truck, or van. It's also more than 11 times as high as dying from any force of nature, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, or lightning strike. These measures also suggest Americans are more likely to die from gun violence than the combined risks of drowning, fire and smoke, stabbing, choking on food, airplane crashes, animal attacks, and natural disasters. Where the data comes from Parents wait for news after a report of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Associated Press/Joel Auerbach The chart above does not account for a person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that could shift the results; it's an average of the entire US population. But it clearly shows that gun violence in the US is a leading cause of death, which is how the CDC describes firearm homicides in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Most of the data comes from an October 2017 report by the National Safety Council and a November 2017 report by the National Center for Health Statistics on causes of death in the US, primarily those that occurred in 2015. (The NSC report uses 2014 data wherever newer data was unavailable.) Mass shootings aren't part of the data sets above, but the Gun Violence Archive project keeps a sourced tally , which we've independently counted. The organization considers any event where four or more victims were injured (regardless of death) to be a mass shooting. In 2015, some 333 mass shootings left 367 people dead and 1,328 injured. The statistics rose in 2016 to 383 mass shootings, 456 deaths, and 1,537 injuries. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings that led to 437 deaths and 1,802 injuries. Foreign-born terrorism data comes from Cato Institute terrorism data , and some natural-disaster data comes from Tulane University . We calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2015 life expectancy and population numbers in the US, and our analysis assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (Mortality data from previous years suggests these rankings are relatively consistent, with the exception of skyrocketing accidental poisonings due to the opioid epidemic. ) You can view our full dataset and sourcing here . A dearth of US gun-violence research Although gun violence is one of the leading causes of death in America, it is also one of the most poorly researched, according to a January 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least-funded cause of death after falls," the study's authors wrote. The study ascribed this dearth of research to restrictions — namely a 21-year-old congressional appropriations bill called the Dickey Amendment that stipulated "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Research into gun violence is the most poorly funded relative to other causes of death. Dr. David E. Stark, Dr. Nigam H. Shah/JAMA This and other federal funding restrictions are still active, hindering many scientists from understanding the problem. "The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done," Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, told Mother Jones in a January 2017 story . "It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources." But what questions have been researched by private institutions like the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a clear connection between gun ownership, gun availability, homicides, and violent death. A roundup of gun-control and gun-violence studies by German Lopez at Vox shows Americans represent less than 5% of the world population but possess nearly 50% of the world's civilian-owned guns, police are about three times more likely to be killed in states with high gun ownership, countries with more guns see more gun deaths , and states with tighter gun control laws see fewer gun-related deaths . This story was updated with the latest final data from CDC, which covers the year 2015. We previously stated that about 11,000 people in the US are killed during firearm assaults; that was a 2014 statistic. In 2015, nearly 13,000 people in the US were killed during firearm assaults.

Shutterstock A gunman in Las Vegas killed dozens and injured hundreds at a country music festival on Sunday. Some 11,000 people in the US are killed in firearm assaults each year. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in America, but research on the problem is bootstrapped due to federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. A gunman fired on a Las Vegas country music festival on Sunday evening, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 525 people. Police identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock , a 64-year-old man from Nevada. Members of the SWAT team who raided Paddock's room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino said they believe he took his own life. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's sheriff also said officers found 23 guns in his room, including what appeared to be at least one modified automatic weapon . Nineteen additional guns were later found in his home, police said. The motive is not yet known for the attack, though the FBI on Monday contradicted ISIS's claim that it was responsible for the massacre, saying Paddock appeared to have "no connection with an international terrorist group." Whatever spurred the event, it is now the deadliest mass shooting in US history — and Paddock's victims join a growing number of people in the US that were intentionally killed at the end of a gun.

Written by Shawn Radcliffe on June 24, 2016 When faced with an armed attacker or a wild animal, fear can be a good thing.  Fear prompts an alert to immediate danger and primes the body to respond in a way that provides protection from that danger.  But as creative creatures, humans also have the ability to anticipate future threats.  These feelings may be triggered by the memory of a traumatic event or something in the environment, like a dark alley or the way someone is dressed.   Sometimes, though, alertness can grow out of control, morphing into anxiety or fear that outpaces the actual risk of danger.  In the past, people may have feared tornadoes whenever the sky darkened, or animal attacks while walking alone in the forest.  These days, fears are just as likely to be related to recent events like the attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando , or the San Bernardino shooting.  “Terrorism and mass shootings have, for now, become part of a ‘national anxiety,’” Daniel Antonius, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, wrote in an email to Healthline.  Read More: More experts approaching gun violence as a public health issue »  Fear out of sync  By itself, fear is not a bad thing.  But when it is out of sync with the actual risks, fear can negatively shape decisions and behaviors.  Taken to the extreme, fear can even cause shutting off from the world.  This is not to say that the world may not be dangerous.  But the dangers may not be what they really seem.  “People are far more likely to be the victim of a property crime or a very traditional street crime than they are to be the victim of an incident of mass violence or terrorism,” Joseph Schafer, Ph.D., a professor of criminal justice at Southern Illinois University, told Healthline.  So how likely is it to die by a mass shooting or terrorist attack?  According to research by The Washington Post , 869 people have been killed in mass shootings in the United States since August 1, 1966.  This includes shootings in which four or more people were killed by one or two shooters. It excludes shootings related to gang violence, as well as those that started as other crimes or involved only the shooter’s family.   Those shootings are a small fraction of the overall number of gun-related deaths. In 2015, of the 25,000 gun-related injuries in the United Stated, 12,000 resulted in death.  Of those, 39 were from mass shootings.  The National Safety Council puts the lifetime risk of being killed in the United States by any assault with a firearm at 1 in 358.  The lifetime risk of dying in a mass shooting is around 1 in 110,154 — about the same chance of dying from a dog attack or legal execution.  There is a three times greater chance of dying from a sharp object than from a mass shooting. The chance of dying from lightning, though, is lower.  In fact, there are many more likely ways to die than in a mass shooting.  Heart disease and cancer are at the top — the risk of dying is 1 in 7. And even dying in a motor vehicle crash is higher — 1 in 113.  And what about terrorist attacks?  Another report by The Washington Post found that in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, the risk of dying in a terrorist incident is less than the risk of being killed by falling furniture or a TV.  Read More: Why gun violence is a public health issue »  Fear lingers after trauma  Even though the risk of dying in a mass shooting or a terrorist attack is low, real fears are rooted in actual events.  “There is a spike in general psychiatric symptoms and disorders after a terror attack, and there is a spike in general fears of future attacks,” said Antonius. “The psychiatric symptoms disappear relatively quickly — within months — but the underlying fear can linger for years after the attack.”  The severity of fear is partly related to where someone was during an attack.  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, people living in New York City experienced greater levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those in other areas of the country.  But the extensive media coverage that follows traumatic events means that even people not directly connected to the event may develop fear or anxiety in response.   “The amount of TV coverage of the attacks being watched is associated with elevated rates of post-traumatic stress disorder,” said Antonius.  One group of researchers found that, following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, people who were exposed to repeated media coverage of the attack, but were not directly involved, reported high levels of stress.  The researchers suggest that seeing or hearing news related to an attack several hours a day might prolong the stress reaction triggered by the initial “collective trauma.”  It’s difficult to know the exact link between media coverage of an attack and people’s fears, but the content that people watch may matter.  “We do tend to see that people who have greater exposure to different types of news media, as well as people who view more crime dramas, tend to express higher levels of fear,” said Schafer, “but it’s not clear which is causing the other.”  People may develop anxiety from watching the news, or people who are anxious may watch the news in order to calm their worries.  News media can also skew the perception of how frequent these events are.  Compare the coverage of a mass shooting to the number of reports about people dying from other causes.  Read More: PTSD can last for years in people who witness traumatic events »  Estimating risks is difficult  Even without the influence of the media, we are not always very good at knowing what is most dangerous in our environment.  “People are not good at estimating actual risk, especially ‘emotionally charged’ risks,” said Antonius.  This is as true for traditional crime as it is for mass shootings.  “We tend to see, across the board, that people’s actual risk of victimization and their fear of crime tend to be disconnected from one another,” said Schafer, “but it’s not in a consistent way.”  Age plays an important role in how people determine — or fail to determine — what is most dangerous.   Young people tend to underestimate risks, even though they are more likely to be victims of crime and violent crime. Middle-aged and older adults, on the other hand, have a moderate amount of fear even though their risk of being a victim is quite low.  In addition to watching the news, our brains can shape how we react to traumatic events.  Dreading an event, like a mass shooting, may feed our fears. But some research has also shown that when people have more control over a situation, they tend to view risks more optimistically.  For example, dying in a motor vehicle accident is more likely than being killed in a plane crash, but flying means giving up control of safety to the pilot, which can feed fears.  Emotions can shape perceptions of risk and also responses to threats.  “In the context of anger, people tend to exhibit greater levels of optimism and sense of control — and preference for confrontation,” said Antonius, “whereas with fear comes greater pessimism and negativity — and preference for using conciliatory measures to de-escalate conflict.”  While for some people the stress and anxiety that follows a mass shooting or terrorist attack can interfere with their daily lives. But for many more their innate survival mechanisms kick in when they need them.  “Most people respond to threats of future terrorism — terrorism fears — in a rational and constructive manner,” said Antonius. “We have, as humans, this innate resilience that helps us move on.”  READ THIS NEXT Essential Gifts for People Who Are Always on the Go What's the perfect gift for someone who's constantly moving and traveling?

Maybe it’s just that I’m congenitally not a worrier, but in my daily life I’m not in the least worried about being the victim of a terrorist attack or a mass shooting, by ISIS, right-wing extremists, or anyone else. Mass shootings and attacks are horrendous, and I can’t imagine how horrible it must be for the people who survive them and the loved ones of those who don’t, but anyone’s actual chances of being involved in one are extremely slight.  According to shootingtracker.com , there have been at least 462 people killed and 1312 injured in 353 mass shootings this year, which is already more than the 383 people killed last year. They define a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are killed or injured, which is a broader definition than the government has used. (Compare that to the 30K or so people killed in auto accidents each year.) According to the Census Bureau, the U.S. currently has a resident population of 322,367,564, giving me a 0.00000143% chance of getting killed in a mass shooting this year by the broadest definition. That’s almost literally a one in a million chance, the phrase we use when something is so unlikely that we won’t bother to worry about it.  Of those 353 shootings, 2 seemed to be related to Islamist terrorism (Chattanooga and San Bernardino), resulting in 19 deaths and 19 injuries. That’s from a site called thereligionofpeace.com, which is trying to prove how murderous Muslims are. By being so diligent in tracking deaths by Muslims, they ultimately show that Muslim terrorists have been responsible for .006% of the attacks and .041% of deaths in mass shootings this year, making my chances of being killed this year by a such a terrorist infinitesimal. So thanks, anti-Muslim website, for reassuring me.  But since deciding what counts as a mass shooting is difficult , let’s look at the most conservative data . Mother Jones magazine has been tracking mass shootings since 1982, and they use the criteria of four or more people killed, which means they don’t consider the recent Planned Parenthood attack a mass shooting, since “only” three people were killed. According to Mother Jones, there have been four mass shootings in the U.S. this year. According to shootingtracker.com data, there were 41 such shootings so far this year. However, they include domestic shootings such as this one and this one , which, while perhaps indicative of a culture of guns and violence, are in a different category than mass shootings in public places with the intent to kill randomly. One more kink. In 2013 Congress lowered the federal number of deaths required: “the term ‘mass killings’ means 3 or more killings in a single incident.” That would allow us to add the Planned Parenthood attack to the four mass shootings tracked by Mother Jones.  So at a conservative estimate there have been 5 mass shootings in the U.S. this year: San Bernadino (14 dead), Oregon (10 dead), Charleston (9 dead), Chattanooga (5 dead), and Colorado (3 dead). Of the 5 shootings, 2 are related to Islamist terrorism, 2 to what I would consider right-wing extremist terrorism (Colorado and Charleston), and 1 (Oregon) to who knows what craziness. By this reckoning, this year, there was a 40% chance of a mass shooting being related to Islamist terrorism, and 46% of the people killed in mass shootings were killed by Islamist terrorists, but still more people were killed by non-Muslim white American men than were killed by Muslims.  That’s a large percentage, but of a tiny number of events, and by these standards my odds increase significantly and I have a 0.00000013% chance of being killed in a mass shooting, and a 5.89389322e-8% chance of being killed by a Muslim terrorist. So despite all the fearmongering, there have been 2 Islamist terrorism incidents in the U.S. this year, giving us individually an insignificant chance of having been killed in one.  [Update] If we expand this analysis over several years, it looks even better. According to thereligionofpeace website, there have been 89 people killed by Muslim terrorists in the U.S. in the last 14 years. (I’m leaving out 9/11 because that is WAY outside the norm.) That averages to be about 6.4 people killed per year. Dividing that average by an average population of 320 million people each year gives a likelihood of death by Muslim terrorist of 2e-8%. That’s even lower than my previous estimate, because the San Bernadino shooting was uncharacteristic, and the largest number of dead since 2009. That’s a 1 in 50,000,000 or so chance each year that I’ll die in a terrorist attack in the U.S.  Just as who you associate with might lead to a domestic shooting, where you work might as well. I work at a university, where bomb threats seem to be increasing. None have actually been bombed because while any dipshit can buy a gun and start shooting people, making bombs is hard, and none of the shootings seemed related to Islamic terrorism. According to this Wikipedia list of attacks related to post-secondary schools, there have been 6 such attacks this year, leaving 17 people dead (including the 10 dead at Umpqua Community College in Oregon). There are 4,140 public or private colleges in the U.S., enrolling almost 18,000,000 students and having tens of thousands of employees. Again, an infinitesimal chance even within the domain of higher education.  None of this is an argument against fighting terrorism and mass shootings or trying to stop gun violence. However, it is an argument that an abnormal fear of being killed in a terrorist attack or mass shooting in the U.S. is unwarranted, and that the fearmongering is little short of demagoguery. Yes, they could happen anywhere, but they’re extremely unlikely to happen here , wherever here is. If the goal of terrorists is to terrorize me, they haven’t won.

To be fair, you’d probably need to take a period of say 20 years, come up with a single year average either for within the United States or all U.S. citizens killed globally, maybe include a function that factors in a marginal increase projecting into the future and then figure out compound lifetime risk. Your point is sound, but the single year methodology is inherently problematic as evidence.”  And my response: “I agree completely. This was a passing thought that I decided to spend a few minutes on doing the most basic of calculations. However, I suspect I’d find pretty much the same thing if I analyzed many years of data. There just aren’t that many terrorist attacks in the U.S. in any given year, and if we use the conservative estimation for mass shootings, there aren’t many of those, either. Despite the fear mongering, the fact is that relatively few people in the U.S. have been killed by terrorists since 9/11. The yearly death rate is very small.”           Wayne Bivens-Tatum on December 8, 2015 at 3:59 pm  said:    Okay, a bit more.

With the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., several days gone but hardly forgotten, the time seems right to examine closely some of the statistical hype that made frightening news alongside details of the horrific shooting. In print and on TV, Americans were bombarded with facts and figures suggesting that the problem of school shootings was out of control. We were informed, for example, that since 2013 there has been an average of one school shooting a week in the U.S., and 18 since the beginning of this year. While these statistics were not exactly lies or fake news, they involved stretching the definition of a school shooting well beyond the limits of most people’s imagination. More: No, there have not been 18 school shootings already this year More: We have a right to bear arms. But after the Florida shooting, it's time for conversation. Everytown for Gun Safety reported that there have been 290 school shootings since the catastrophic massacre in Newtown, Conn., more than five years ago. However, very few of these were anything akin to Sandy Hook or Parkland. Sure, they all involved a school of some type (including technical schools and colleges) as well as a firearm, but the outcomes were hardly similar. Nearly half of the 290 were completed or attempted suicides, accidental discharges of a gun, or shootings with not a single individual being injured. Of the remainder, the vast majority involved either one fatality or none at all. It is easy to believe that school shootings are the “new normal” as has been intimated, or that we are facing a crisis of epidemic proportions. When schools are placed on lockdown based on an active shooter alert (which many times is a false alarm), cable news channels immediately inform their viewers of the danger, and word is tweeted and retweeted to millions, most of whom have no direct connection to the event. And when gunshots ring out, we hear the sounds replayed from cellphone recordings and watch through satellite feed as terrified survivors flee the scene. It makes a lasting impression, to be sure. For all those who believe that schools are under siege like never before, it is instructive to take a statistical road trip back in time. Since 1990, there have been 22 shootings at elementary and secondary schools in which two or more people were killed, not counting those perpetrators who committed suicide. Whereas five of these incidents have occurred over the past five-plus years since 2013, claiming the lives of 27 victims (17 at Parkland), the latter half of the 1990s witnessed seven multiple-fatality shootings with a total of 33 killed (13 at Columbine ). In fact, the 1997-98 school year was so awful, with four multiple-fatality shooting sprees at the hands of armed students (in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, Ore.), that then-President Clinton formed a White House expert committee to advise him. Nearly a decade later, President Bush convened a White House Conference on School Safety in the wake of multiple-fatality incidents during his administration. More: Survivor: I will never be OK until we stop school shootings POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Of course, I don’t mean to minimize any of the one-per week on average school shootings, but they should not be conflated with the most deadly but rare events. Unfortunately, most readers and viewers don’t appreciate the distinction when statistics including non-fatal school shootings are cited whenever there is mass killing at a school. Notwithstanding the occasional multiple-fatality shooting that takes place at one of the 100,000 public  schools across America, the nation’s schools are safe. Over the past quarter-century, on average about 10 students are slain in school shootings annually. Compare the school fatality rate with the more than 100 school-age children accidentally killed each year riding their bikes  or walking to school. Congress might be too timid to pass gun legislation to protect children, but how about a national bicycle helmet law for minors? Half of the states do not require them. There is no NRA — National Riding Association — opposing that. I’m all for shielding our kids from harm. But let’s at least deal with the low hanging fruit while we debate and Congress does nothing about the role of guns in school shootings.

With their acts of witness and advocacy, the teenage protesters of Parkland, Florida, shook many voters out of their complacency about pervasive gun violence. Upwards of 30,000 people lose their lives to firearms in our nation each year, a level of carnage unparalleled anywhere in the developed world. And yet, last October — just days after the worst mass shooting in American history — only 52 percent of Americans told CNN’s pollsters that they supported “stricter gun laws.”    Four Best Friends From Parkland Explain Why March for Our Lives Matters          Today, that figure is 70 percent — the highest it’s been at any time since 1993. Recent polls from Quinnipiac University and Politico /Morning Consult have produced nearly identical results. In Florida, long a bastion of NRA support, the leftward turn in public opinion has been especially sharp.     Q-poll's FL voter survey is a PR nightmare for the NRA 56–40% oppose armed teachers 62-33 back assault weapons ban 62–34 back high volume magazine ban 78-20 back all gun buyers be 21 or older 96-3 back universal background checks 87-10 back waiting time for all gun buys — Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) February 28, 2018    Moderate Democrats have had their “come to an assault weapons ban” moment . Moderate Republicans (such as they are) are imploring their party to move left on the gun issue. Major gun sellers are cutting ties with the NRA and imposing their own restrictions on firearm sales. Even Donald Trump has called for strengthening America’s background check system.    By keeping the national spotlight on the mass murder at their high school — and calling on their peers across the country to walk out of their schools, so as to “ no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings ” in the United States — the theater kids of Marjory Stoneman Douglas have built the broadest public consensus for gun-safety measures that America has seen in a quarter-century.    But they’ve also (inadvertently) triggered a moral panic about the safety of America’s schools that has little basis in empirical reality — and which is already lending momentum to policies that would increase juvenile incarceration , waste precious educational resources on security theater, and bring more guns into our nation’s classrooms.  On Tuesday in Tallahassee, Republicans in Florida’s state legislature advanced a law that aims to put one police officer — and ten gun-wielding teachers — into every public school in the state. The $67 million “school marshal” program would provide teachers who volunteer to be emergency gunslingers with a $500 stipend, a background check, drug test, psychological exam, and 132 hours of training. In total, the bill’s school safety measures come at a price tag of $400 million. One piece of that package — an increase in funding for mental health counselors — is laudable. The rest are either unnecessary or actively dangerous. The average salary for a teacher in Florida is nearly $10,000 less than the national mean; its public school system consistently ranks among the bottom half of U.S. states. This is not a place that can afford to misallocate hundreds of millions of dollars in educational funds.      The bill moving through Florida’s House of Representatives does pair that $400 million appropriation with a few gun reforms — a three-day waiting period for firearm purchases, an increase in the legal age for gun-buying from 18 to 21, and measures expanding the authority of police officers to confiscate guns from people who threaten to commit violence.  By themselves, those reforms are better than nothing. And the fact that Republican state legislators are pushing them forward — over the objections of the NRA — is a testament to the power of the Parkland protesters. But the impact of such modest regulations of the gun market, in a nation where firearms outnumber people, is likely to be marginal at best. And if the bill’s gun reforms cannot be separated from its “school marshal” program and expansion of classroom cops, then Florida’s young people might end up worse off than they’d be if their elected leaders had simply ignored the Parkland massacre, like so many mass shootings before it.  After the atrocity at Columbine High School in 1999, America tested the hypothesis that a massive increase in school policing would lead to lower rates of violence on campus — in 1997, 10 percent of public schools employed at least one police officer; by 2014, 30 percent did . The results of this experiment have been worse than disappointing. The best available research suggests that putting police officers in schools does not significantly deter crime — but does increase the number of students who end up incarcerated for minor youthful indiscretions (and/or, who get electrocuted with stun guns in their classrooms for the same).  Arming teachers, meanwhile, is a proposal so mind-bogglingly dumb and dangerous, even Florida’s GOP governor Rick Scott rejects it. There is no evidence whatsoever that adding a not-so-well regulated militia of amateur marksmen to every school faculty will prevent mass shootings, when armed guards have consistently failed to do so — but there is good reason to believe that such a program would radically worsen our nation’s preexisting crisis of racially discriminatory, teacher-on-student violence. As Patrick Blanchfield argues for the Intercept :      In 2017, researchers estimated that, in a given school year, 589 children are corporally punished (most often struck with paddles) every day . Unsurprisingly, this violent discipline is disproportionately inflicted on students of color . Black students are twice as likely as whites to be struck in Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In Maine, black children are eight times more likely to be hit than white children are. Children with disabilities also suffer a disproportionate share of this disciplinary violence. In a representative year, school authorities pinned down, tied up, or otherwise restrained 267,000 American schoolchildren , three-quarters of whom had some kind of disability; such practices have resulted in multiple fatalities . … America already has abundant and grim evidence about the outcomes of interactions between youth and armed authority figures. The lethality of our police has no real analog in the developed world: One-third of all Americans killed by strangers are killed by police. Here, too, the landscape of violence betrays stark disparities, particularly when it comes to children: Black teens are 21 times more likely to be shot dead than their white peers, and people with disabilities and mental illnesses are acutely vulnerable as well …Why would we expect different outcomes from arming teachers?  If the policy response to the Parkland shooting ends up hurting more American students than it helps, the lion’s share of responsibility will lie with the Republican Party. The Parkland survivors have been as emphatic in their rejection of arming teachers as they’ve been in their support for gun restrictions — and they’ve won the general public to their side of both issues.  But some of the hyperbolic rhetoric that progressives have embraced over the past two weeks has made it easier for the right to push regressive school safety policies. Such hyperbole pervades the mission statement for the post-Parkland protest movement, March for Our Lives:      Not one more. We cannot allow one more child to be shot at school. We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the lives of students. We cannot allow one more family to wait for a call or text that never comes. Our schools are unsafe. Our children and teachers are dying. We must make it our top priority to save these lives. March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar. … School safety is not a political issue. There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing … Every kid in this country now goes to school wondering if this day might be their last. We live in fear.  American children do not “risk their lives” when they show up to school each morning — or at least, not nearly as much as they do whenever they ride in a car, swim in a pool, or put food in their mouths (an American’s lifetime odds of dying in a mass shooting committed in any location is 1 in 11,125; of dying in a car accident is 1 and 491; of drowning is 1 in 1,133; and of choking on food is 1 in 3,461). Criminal victimization in American schools has collapsed in tandem with the overall crime rate, leaving U.S. classrooms safer today than at any time in recent memory.        Illustration: National Institute of Justice      And, perhaps most critically, there is no epidemic of mass shootings in American schools — at least, not under the conventional definitions of those terms.      In the immediate aftermath of the Parkland shooting, progressive activists and commentators (including this one) repeatedly claimed that there had been 18 school shootings since the start of this year. This proved to be a gross exaggeration . In reality, according to new research from Northeastern University , there have been a grand total of eight mass shootings (shootings that kill at least four people) at K-through-12 schools in the United States since 1996. Meanwhile, over the past 20 years, the number of fatal shootings in American schools (of any kind) has plummeted.              If mass school shootings were the only form of gun violence in the United States, the case for treating the regulation of firearms as a pressing policy issue would actually be fairly weak. For the past quarter-century, there has been an average of one mass murder (a killing of four or more people committed with any weapon, as opposed to just firearms) in an American school each year. Every one of those atrocities is a blight on humanity. But it is nearly impossible to design a policy that can bring the incidence of an already exceptionally rare crime down to zero — and given the inherently limited nature of legislative time and resources, it would make little sense to prioritize such a marginal and difficult issue over public health challenges that kill exponentially more people.    There is no “school safety” crisis in the U.S.; only a gun violence epidemic that consists primarily of suicides, accidents, and single-victim homicides committed with handguns. In the decades since Columbine, progressives have often led the public to believe otherwise. And for understandable reasons. Spectacular acts of mass murder committed against children (especially upper-middle class children in “good” public schools) attract a degree of media attention and political concern that our nation’s (roughly) 20,000 annual firearm suicides — and daily acts of urban gang violence — simply do not. The most misleading piece of the Parkland survivors’ message — that their experience is representative of a widespread social problem that threatens the lives of all American children — may well be its most politically effective component.    But if misrepresenting the nature of America’s gun problem has political benefits, it also has policy drawbacks. After all, if the March for Our Lives mission statement were actually true — if “every kid in this country” went “to school wondering if this day might be their last” — then there would be a reasonable case for filling American schools with law enforcement agents and increasing the use of juvenile detention.  And the right is already making that case: In recent days, conservative media outlets have suggested that the Parkland shooting could have been prevented if only Broward County hadn’t implemented the PROMISE program (Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Supports & Education) in 2013 — a policy that aimed to reduce juvenile arrests by promoting non-carceral approaches to correcting student misbehavior.  All of which is to say: The Parkland teenagers, and the movement they have launched, has made a vital contribution to American politics. They’ve stiffened the spines of Democratic gun safety advocates; unnerved Republican NRA stooges; improved the prospects of meaningful gun reform at the federal level in the medium-term; and provided a model of civic engagement to a rising generation whose political participation our country desperately needs.  But to ensure that those contributions aren’t shadowed by the unintended consequences of overheated rhetoric, the March for Our Lives and its supporters must take pains to ensure that their advocacy always affirms this basic truth: Schools don’t kill people, guns kill people.

Most of the victims are chosen not for what they have done but simply for where they happen to be.      There is no universally accepted definition of a public mass shooting, and this piece defines it narrowly. It looks at the public shootings in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (two shooters in a few cases). It does not include shootings tied to gang disputes or robberies that went awry, and it does not include shootings that took place exclusively in private homes. A broader definition would yield much higher numbers.   Mass shootings are a small slice of total gun deaths   Source: Gun Violence Archive , Post research       This tally begins Aug. 1, 1966, when a student sniper fired down on passersby from the observation deck of a clock tower at the University of Texas. By the time police killed him, 17 other people were dead or dying. As Texas Monthly’s Pamela Colloff wrote , the shooting “ushered in the notion that any group of people, anywhere — even walking around a university campus on a summer day — could be killed at random by a stranger.”       Search for details of a particular shooting.

Two unborn children are included in the official death tolls from shootings in Austin and Sutherland Springs, Texas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              292 guns    Shooters often carried more than one weapon; one was found with 24. At least  of mass shooters’ weapons were obtained legally and were obtained illegally . It’s unclear how weapons were acquired.

Semiautomatic rifles  Semiautomatic rifles have been used in some of the country’s deadliest shootings, such as those in Newtown, Orlando, San Bernardino and Las Vegas. The AR-15, a lightweight, customizable version of the military’s M16, soared in popularity after a 10-year federal ban on assault weapons expired in 2004. Some of the Las Vegas shooter’s guns had been fitted with legal devices called “bump-fire stocks,” which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire as quickly as automatic ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Semiautomatic pistols  The country’s most popular type of firearm, 9mm semiautomatic handguns, are used by many law enforcement officers. They are generally light and inexpensive, easy to conceal and control, and they fire as quickly as a person can pull the trigger. The gunman who killed 
32 students and teachers at Virginia Tech in 2007 used a 9mm semiautomatic Glock 19 (and a .22-caliber Walther P22, another popular caliber). In this data, 9mm semiautomatic handguns show up more than any other weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         153 shooters    Some of these mass shooters were known to have violent tendencies or criminal pasts. Others seemed largely fine until they attacked. All but were male. The vast majority were between the ages of 20 and 49. More than half — of them — died at or near the scene of the shooting, often by killing themselves.

Women  The most recent female shooter was a Pakistani mother who helped kill 14 partygoers at her husband’s workplace in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015.
